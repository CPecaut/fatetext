# FATEtext, Version 0.93

"decentralized open source community online"

FameText is an open source (MIT License) reference implementation for a novel approach to hosting online communities that does not necessarily rely on the 1990s era liability shield for US Internet companies known as, "Section 230."

I tested this version of FaTe (0.93) on my personal computer using MacOS and MAMP (5.7), which runs PHP (7.4.2), but I avoided using any Javascript, and future versions of FaTe will not use cookies for session management, etc.

The about page template (which mostly consists of plain HTML) in templates/about.php includes more information about what you can do once you stage an instance of FaTe online.
