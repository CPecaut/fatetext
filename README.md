# FATEtext, Version 0.5

"hosting for decentralized open source online communities since 2021"

Fatetext (aka. FATE) is an open source (MIT License) reference implementation for a novel approach to hosting online communities that does not necessarily rely on the 1990s era liability shield for US Internet companies known as, "Section 230."

I tested this version of FATE (0.5) on my personal computer using MAMP (5.7), which runs PHP (7.4.2), but I avoided using any Javascript, and FATE also doesn't use cookies for session management, etc.

You can [download the source code directly](TODO) or get it from Github via: https://github.com/tperry256/fatetext

Please see the following demo videos for more information about how to create a your own instance of FATEtext:
