<i>"A Monte-Carlo Method for Elaborating the Meaning of a Text"</i>

<br><br>

<u>Without loss of generality, let</u>:

<br><br>

SENTENCE: "And the LORD God formed man of the dust of the ground"<br>
WORD: "formed"<br>
GEM: "And the LORD God _______ man of the dust of the ground"<br>
TEXT: the Bible

<br><br>

ORACULAR: select a random SENTENCE and redact a WORD in order to produce a GEM<br>
SYSTEM: FATEtext (implemented in PHP), textORACLE (python), etc.<br>
USER: you (the reader of this human readable dataset)

<br><br>

Step1: ask the USER of a software SYSTEM to guess what WORD was redacted <b>-or</b><br>
STEP1: ask the USER of a software SYSTEM to define the WORD, without any context

<br><br>

Step2: ask the USER to ask a question about the SENTENCE after guessing the WORD <b>-or-</b><br>
STEP2: ask the USER redefine the WORD in the context of the SENTENCE, only

<br><br>

Step3: ask the USER to answer their own question, in accordance with the meaning of the TEXT <b>-or-</b><br>
STEP3: ask the USER to represent the WORD in the context of the TEXT and the world in which everything exists
