VALA

Night the First

The Song of the Aged Mother which shook the heavens with wrath* {This page is a very thicket of revisions, erasures, and inconsistent directions for rearranging the order of the lines. We have here restored two lines, marked in the manuscript as 6 and 7 (omitted from Erdman's transcription) on the grounds that the two cancelled lines following are rewritten as lines 2 and 3. Thus, the lines marked 6 and 7 would still follow 2 & 3. Please consult the manuscript page. LFS} 
Hearing the march of long resounding strong heroic Verse
Marshalld in order for the day of Intellectual Battle

His fall into Division & his Resurrection to Unity 
His fall into the Generation of Decay & Death & his Regeneration by the Resurrection from the dead* 
Begin with Tharmas Parent power. darkning in the West 
Lost! Lost! Lost! are my Emanations Enion [Come Forth,] O Enion 
We are become a Victim to the Living We hide in secret* 
I have hidden thee Enion, in Jealous Despair Jerusalem in Silent Contrition O Pity Me 
I will build thee a Labyrinth also O pity me O Enionwhere we may remain for ever alone 
Why hast thou taken sweet Jerusalem from my inmost Soul 
Let her Lay secret in the Soft recess of darkness & silence 
It is not Love I bear to Enitharmon [Jerusalem?]* It is Pity??? * 
She hath taken refuge in my bosom & I cannot cast her out. 
The Men have recieved their death wounds & their Emanations are fled 
To me for refuge & I cannot turn them out for Pitys sake *{inserted vertically, up the left side of the page. LFS}

Enion said--Thy fear has made me tremble thy terrors have surrounded me *{this verse paragraph appears to be an insertion over erased text. LFS} 
All Love is lost Terror succeeds & Hatred instead of Love 
And stern demands of Right & Duty instead of Liberty. 
Once thou wast to Me the loveliest son of heaven--But now 
Why art thou Terrible and yet I love thee in thy terror till 
I am almost Extinct & soon shall be a Shadow in Oblivion 
Unless some way can be found that I may look upon thee & live 
Hide me some Shadowy semblance. secret whispring in my Ear 
In secret of soft wings. in mazes of delusive beauty 
I have lookd into the secret soul of him I lovd 
And in the Dark recesses found Sin & cannot return 
Trembling & pale sat Tharmas weeping in his clouds 
Why wilt thou Examine every little fibre of my soul *{This and the following 4 lines are written down the top right hand edge of the page. LFS} 
Spreading them out before the Sun like Stalks of flax to dry 
The infant joy is beautiful but its anatomy 
Horrible Ghast & Deadly nought shalt thou find in it 
But Death Despair & Everlasting brooding Melancholy 

Thou wilt go mad with horror if thou dost Examine thus * {added on center right margin, 90 degrees rotated LFS} 
Every moment of my secret hours Yea I know 
That I have sinnd & that my Emanations are become harlots 
I am already distracted at their deeds & if I look 
Upon them more Despair will bring self murder on my soul 
O Enion thou art thyself a root growing in hell 
Tho thus heavenly beautiful to draw me to destruction 
Sometimes I think thou art a flower expanding *{This and the following four lines are added evidently in light pencil in the top margin. LFS} 
Sometimes I think thou art fruit breaking from its bud 
In dreadful dolor & pain & I am like an atom 
A Nothing left in darkness yet I am an identity 
I wish & feel & weep & groan Ah terrible terrible

{First 8 lines inserted over a deleted strata LFS} Woven by their own hands to hide them in the darksom grave 
But Males immortal live renewd by female deaths. in soft 
Delight they die & they revive in spring with music & songs 
Enion said Farewell I die I hide. from thy searching eyes 
So saying--From her bosom weaving soft in Sinewy threads 
A tabernacleof Delight for Jerusalem. She sat among the Rocks* 
{insert over strike out LFS} Singing her Lamentation. Tharmas groand among his Clouds 
Weeping, and then bending from his Clouds he stoopd his holy innocent head* 
{innocent replaces holy LFS} And stretching out his holy hand in the vast Deep sublime 
Turnd round the circle of Destiny with tears & bitter sighs 
And said. Return O Wanderer when the Day of Clouds is oer 
So saying he sunk down into the sea a pale white corse* 
{this and the following 2 lines appear written over an erased strata LFS} So saying In torment he sunk down & flowd among her filmy Wooft 
His Spectre issuing from his feet in flames of fire 
In dismal gnawing pain drawn out by her lovd fingers every nerve t 
She counted. every vein & lacteal threading them among 
Her woof of terror. Terrified & drinking tears of woe 
Shuddring she wove--nine days & nights Sleepless her food was tears 
Wondring she saw her woof begin to animate. & not 
As Garments woven subservient to her hands but having a will 
Of its own perverse & wayward Enion lovd & wept* 
{written vertically up the right margin LFS}

Nine days she labourd at her work. & nine dark sleepless nights 
But on the tenth bright trembling morn the Circle of Destiny Completet 
Round rolld the Sea Englobing in a watry Globe self balancd* 
{a light line appears through this line LFS} A Frowning Continent appeard Where Enion in the Desart 
Terrified in her own Creation viewing her woven shadow 
Sat in a sweet dread intoxication of false woven bliss self woven sorrow Repentance & Contrition* 
{sequence of revisions, appearent in order presented here LFS} There is from Great Eternity a mild & pleasant rest 
Namd Beulah a Soft Moony Universe feminine lovely 
Pure mild & Gentle given in Mercy to those who sleep 
Eternally. Created by the Lamb of God around 
On all sides within & without the Universal Man 
The Daughters of Beulah follow sleepers in all their Dreamst 
Creating Spaces lest they fall into Eternal Death 
The Circle of Destiny complete they gave to it a Space 
And namd the Space Ulro & brooded over it in care & love* 
{this entire passage is written vertically down the right margin and appears to have been first entered lightly (pencil?) and then written over (ink?) LFS}

They said The Spectre is in every man insane & most 
Deformd Thro the three heavens descending in fury & fire 
We meet it with our Songs & loving blandishments & give 
To it a form of vegetation But this Spectre of Tharmas 
Is Eternal Death What shall we do O God help pity & help 
So spoke they & closd the Gate of Auricular power nerves the Tongue in trembling fear* 
{Passage written down the right margin LFS}
What have I done! said Enion accursed wretch! What deed. 
Is this a deed of Love I know what I have done. I know 
Too late now to repent. Love is changd to deadly Hate [Fears] 
A [All?] life is blotted out & I alone remain possessd with Fears 
I see the [remembrance] Shadow of the dead within my [eyes] Soul wandering* 
{bracketed words blotted out, revised as indicated by italics LFS} In darkness & solitude forming Seas of [Trouble] Doubt & rocks of [sorrow] Repentance* 
{bracketed words blotted LFS} Already are my Eyes reverted. all that I behold 
Within my Soul has lost its splendor & a brooding Fear 
Shadows me oer & drives me outward to a world of woe 
So waild she trembling before her own Created Phantasm*

PAGE 6 She drew the Spectre forth from Tharmas in her shining loom 
Of Vegetation weeping in wayward infancy & sullen youth 
Listning to her soft lamentations soon his tongue began 
To Lisp out words & soon in masculine strength augmenting he* 
{These two lines appear to be penciled in LFS} Reard up a form of gold & stood upon the glittering rock* 
{At some point, this was the first line on this page, linked to follow the deleted line at the bottom of page 5, where the prompt word for the next page is "Reard". This is a crucial set of revisions, reflecting some ambiguity about the relation between "shadow" and "spectre". LFS}
A shadowy human form winged & in his depths 
The dazzlings as of gems shone clear, rapturous in joy fury 
Glorying in his own eyes Exalted in terrific Pride 
[ Searching for glory wishing that the heavens had eyes to See 
And courting that the Earth would ope her Eyelids & behold
Such wondrous beauty repining in the midst of all his glory
That nought but Enion could be found to praise adore & love 
Three days in self admiring raptures on the rocks he flamd 
And three dark nights repind the solitude. but the third morn 
Astonishd he found Enion hidden in the darksom Cave

She spoke What am I wherefore was I put forth on these rocks
Among the Clouds to tremble in the wind in solitude
Where is the voice that lately woke the desart Where the face 
That wept among the clouds & where the voice that shall reply
No other living thing is here. The Sea the Earth. the Heaven 
And Enion desolate where art though Tharmas O return

Three days she waild & three dark nights sitting among the Rocks
While the bright spectre hid himself among the ?backing clouds 
Then sleep fell on her eyelids in a Chasm of the Valley 
The Sixteenth morn the Spectre stood before her manifest ] 
The Spectre thus spoke. [ Art thou not my slave & shalt thou dare
To smite me with thy tongue beware lest I sting also thee,] 
Who art thou Diminutive husk & shell* [ 
Broke from my bonds I scorn my prison & yet I love] 
If thou hast sinnd & art polluted know that I am pure* 
And unpolluted & will bring to rigid strict account 
All thy past deeds [So] hear what I tell thee! mark it well! remember!* 
This world is [Mine] Thine in which thou dwellest that within thy soul* 
That dark & dismal infinite where Thought roams up & down 
Is [thine] Mine & there thou goest when with one Sting of my tongue
Envenomd thou rollst inwards to the place [of death & hell where] whence I emergd
She trembling answerd Wherefore was I born & what am I 
[A sorrow & a fear a living torment & naked Victim] 
I thought to weave a Covering [from his] for my Sins from wrath of Tharmas* 
{This entire paragraph, internally revised, is marked for deleting, evidently, by two diagonal strike out lines. The page image should be consulted LFS}
PAGE 7 Examining the sins of Tharmas I have soon found my own
O slay me not thou art his Wrath embodied in Deceit
I thought Tharmas a Sinner & I murderd his Emanations *
His secret loves & Graces Ah me wretched What have I done *
For now I find that all those Emanations were my Childrens Souls *
And I have murderd them with Cruelty above atonement *
Those that remain have fled from my cruelty into the desarts
Singing with both to ownAnd thou the delusive tempter to these deeds sittest before me *
(illegible)But where is (illegible) Tharmas all thy soft delusive beauty cannot
Tempt me to murder honest lovemy own soul & wipe my tears & smile
In this thy world for ah! hownot mine tho dark I feel my world within *
The Spectre said Thou sinful Woman. was it thy desire
That I should hide thee with my power & delight thee with my beauty
And now there darknest in my presence, never from my sight
Shalt thou depart to weep in secret. In my jealous wings
I evermore will hold thee when though goest out or comest in
Tis thou hast darkend all My World O Woman lovely bare
Thus they contended? all the day, among the Caves of Tharmas
Twisting in fearful forms & hoisting howling harsh shrieking
Howling harsh shrieking, mingling their bodies pain in burning anguish
Mingling his horrible brightness with her tender limbs; then high she soar'd *
ShriekingAbove the ocean; a bright wonder that Beulah shudder'd atNature *
Half Woman & half Spectre, all his lovely changing colours mix *
With her fair crystal clearness; in her lips & cheeks his poisons rose *
In blushes like the morning, and his scaly armour softening *
A monster lovely in the heavens or wandering on the earth, *
With Spectre voice incessant waiting, in incessant thirst>
Beauty all blushing with desire mocking her fell despair>
Wandering desolate, a wonder abhorr'd by Gods & Men
PAGE 8 Till with fierce pain she brought forth on the rocks her sorrow & woe
Behold two [little Infants wept]upon the desolate wind. *
[Then forms of horror howled]
The first state weeping they began & helpless as a wave
Beaten along its sightless way growing enormous in its motion to
Its utmost goal, till strength from Enion like richest summer shining *
Raisd the [bright][fierce]boy & girl with glories from their heads out beaming *
Drawing forth drooping mothers pity drooping mothers sorrow *
But those in Great Eternity Met in the Council of God
As One Man hovering over Gilead & Hermon
He is the Good Shepherd He is the Lord & Master
To Create Man Morning by Morning to Give gifts at Noon day
Enion brooded, oer the rocks, the rough rocks vegetating groaning vegetate
Such power was given to the Solitary wanderer. 
The barked Oak, the long limbed Beech; the Ches'nut tree; the Pine. 
[] [] The Pear tree mild, the frowning Walnut, the sharp Crab, & Apple sweet, 
The rough bark opens; twittering peep forth little beaks & wings
The Nightingale, the Goldfinch, Robin, Lark, Linnet & Thrush
The Goat leap'd from the craggy Rock cliff, the Sheep awoke from the mould
Upon its green stalk the Corn, waving innumerable
Infolding the bright Infants from the desolating winds
They sulk upon her breast her hair became like snow on mountains
Weaker & weaker, weeping woful, wearier and wearier
Faded & her bright Eyes decayd melted with pity & love

[And then they wanderd far away she sought for them in vain *
In weeping blindness stumbling she followd them oer rocks & mountains]
{These lines in the top margin were erased and replaced with an image of Christ in an orb.GD}
And then they wanderd far away she sought for them in vain *
In weeping blindness stumbling she followd them oer rocks & mountains
Rehumanizing from the Spectre in pangs of maternal love
Ingrate they wanderd scorning her drawing her life majesticSpectrous Life
Repelling her away & away by a dread repulsive power
Into Non Entity revolving around in dark despair.
[Till they had drawn the Spectre quite away from Enion]
And drawing in the Spectrous life in pride and haughty joy
Thus Enion gave them all her spectrous life in dark despair. 

Then Eno [Ono] a daughter of Beulah took a Moment of Time *
And drew it out to twenty years Seven thousand years with much care & affliction *
And many tears & in the twenty Every years gave visions toward heaven made windows into Eden *
She also took an atom of space & opend its center
Into Infinitude & ornamented it with wondrous art
{This is where Erdman puts these 2 lines, which appear diagonally on the page in the upper-left corner, near the exta-marginal block of text which is inserted after line 7. However, there is no cue from the manuscript about exactly where these lines should be inserted, so Erdman's placement of them is conjectural.GD}
Astonishd sat her Sisters of Beulah to see her soft affections
To Enion & her children & they ponderd these things wondring
And they Alternate kept watch over the Youthful terrors
They saw not yet the Hand Divine for it was not yet reveald
But they went on in Silent Hope & Feminine repose
But Los & Enitharmon delighted in the Moony spaces of Eno *
Nine Times they livd among the forests, feeding on sweet fruits
And nine bright Spaces wanderd weaving mazes of delight
Snaring the wild Goats for their milk they eat the flesh of Lambs
A male & female naked & ruddy as the pride of summer
Alternate Love & Hate his breast; hers Scorn & Jealousy
In embryon passions. they kiss'd not nor embrac'd for shame & fear They ?kissd ?not nor for ?shame they embracd not

{These fragments penciled in above the ink line.GD}
He could controll the times & seasons, & the days & years
She could controll the spaces, regions, desart, flood & forest
But had no power to weave a Veil of covering for her Sins
She drave the Females all away from Los
And Los drave all the Males from her away
They wanderd long, till they sat down upon the margind sea. 
Conversing with the visions of Beulah in dark slumberous bliss *
Nine years they view the turning spheres of Beulah reading the Visions of Beulah 
Night the Second {inserted above the following lines LFS} 
But the two youthful wonders wanderd in the world of Tharmas *
Thy name is Enitharmon; said the bright fierce prophetic boy *
[While they.....Harmony]
While thy mild voice fills all these Caverns with sweet harmony
O how thy our Parents sit & weep mourn in their silent secret bowers *
PAGE 1O
But Enitharmon answerd with a dropping tear & smiling frowning*
[[Bright]]Dark as a dewy morning when the crimson light appears *
To make us happy how they let them weary their immortal powers *
While we draw in their sweet delights while we return them scorn *
On scorn to feed our discontent; for if we grateful prove
They will withhold sweet love, whose food is thorns & bitter roots. 
We hear the warlike clarions we view the turning spheres *
Yet Thou in indolence reposest holding me in bonds {These lines first appear after line 2, but are marked to be moved here.GD} 
Hear! I will sing a [[Dirge]]Song of Death! it is a [[Dirge]]Song of Vala! *
The [[Eternal]]Fallen Man takes his repose: Urizen sleeps in the porch *
Luvah and Vala [[wake]] woke & fly flew up from the Human Heart *
Into the Brain; from thence upon the pillow Vala slumber'd. 
And Luvah siez'd the Horses of Light, & rose into the Chariot of Day
Sweet laughter siezd me in my sleep! silent & close I laughd*
For in the visions of Vala I walkd with the mighty Fallen One *
I heard his voice among the branches, & among sweet flowers. *
Why is the light of [[Vala]] Enitharmon darken'd in her dewy morn *
Why is the silence of [[Vala lightning]] Enitharmon a Cloud terror & her smile a whirlwind *
Uttering this darkness in my halls, in the pillars of my Holy-ones
Why dost thou weep [[O]] as Vala? & wet thy veil with dewy tears, *
In slumbers of my night-repose, infusing a false morning? 
Driving the Female Emanations all away from Los *
I have refusd to look upon the Universal Vision
And wilt thou slay with death him who devotes himself to thee *
If thou drivst all the Males Females away from Vala Luvah I will drive all
The Males away from thee
Once born for the sport & amusement of Man now born to drink up all his Powers
PAGE 11
I heard the sounding sea; I heard the voice weaker and weaker;
The voice came & went like a dream, I awoke in my sweet bliss.
Then Los smote her upon the Earth twas long eer she revivd {This line inserted in pencil.GD}

He Losanswer'd, darkning more with indignation hid in smiles *
I die not Enitharmon tho thou singst thy Song of Death *
Nor shalt thou me torment For I behold the Fallen Man *
Seeking to comfort Vala [[word]]she will not be comforted *
She rises from his throne and seeks the shadows of her garden
Weeping for Luvah lost, in the bloody beams of your false morning
Sickning lies the Fallen Man his head sick his heart faint *
Mighty atchievement of your power! Beware the punishment
Refusing to behold the Divine image which all behold
And live thereby. he is sunk down into a deadly sleep
But we immortal in our strength survive by stern debate
Till we have drawn the Lamb of god into a mortal form
And that he must be born is certain for One must be All
And comprehend within himself all things both small & great
We therefore for whose sake all things aspire to be be & live
Will so recieve the Divine Image that amongst the Reprobate
He may be devoted to Destruction from his mothers womb {This group of 9 lines, "Refusing...womb," are marked to be inserted; the entire group of lines is also crossed with a diagonal line which may indicate 1) a later intention to delete them; or 2) that the stanza is meant to replace the stanza beginning "I die not Enitharmon... punishment"; or 3) that the stanza is intended to follow "Nor shalt ... Fallen Man."GD}

I see, invisible descend into the Gardens of Vala
Luvah walking on the winds, I see the invisible knife
I see the shower of blood: I see the swords & spears of futurity
Tho in the Brain of Man we live, & in his circling Nerves.
Tho' this bright world of all our joy is in the Human Brain.
Where Urizen & all his Hosts hang their immortal lamps
Thou neer shalt leave this cold expanse where watry Tharmas mourns
So spoke Los. Scorn & Indignation rose upon Enitharmon
Then Enitharmon reddning fierce stretchd her immortal hands *
?Threaten ?not ?me ?O ?visionary ?thine ?the ?punishment {Erdman does not provide this line of inserted and struck text, but it appears to be the same text as Blake inserts below.GD}
Descend O Urizen descend with horse & chariot
Threaten not me O visionary thine the punishment!
The Human Nature shall no more remain nor Human acts
Form the free rebellious Spirits of Heaven. but War & Princedom
& Victory & Blood *
PAGE 12 {This page contains partially visible erased text running horizontally and, in the right and left margins, vertically.GD}
Night darkend as she spoke! a shuddring ran from East to West *
A Groan was heard on high. The warlike clarions ceast. the Spirits
Of Luvah & Vala shudderd in their Orb: an orb of blood! *
Eternity groand & was troubled at the Image of Eternal Death
The Wandering Man bow'd his faint head and Urizen descended
And the one must have murderd the other if he had not descended *
Indignant muttering low thunders; Urizen descended
Gloomy sounding, Now I am God from Eternity to Eternity
Sullen sat Los plotting Revenge. Silent he Urizeneye'd the Prince * {In the gap after this stanza, several fragments of erased lines appear:

?Pity ?not Luvah
& these... GD} 
Of Light. Silent the prince of Light viewd Los. at length a brooded *
Smile broke from Urizen for Enitharmon brightend more & more
Sullen he lowerd on Enitharmon but he smild on Los

Saying Thou art the Lord of Luvah into thine hands I give
The prince of Love the murderer his soul is in thine hands
Pity not Vala for she pitied not the Eternal Man
Nor pity thou the cries of Luvah. Lo these starry hosts
They are thy servants if thou wilt obey my awful Law
Los answerd furious art thou one of those who when most complacent
Mean mischief most. If you are such Lo! I am also such
One must be master. try thy Arts I also will try mine
For I percieve Thou hast Abundance which I claim as mine
Urizen startled stood but not Long soon he cried
Obey my voice young Demon I am God from Eternity to Eternity
Thus Urizen spoke collected in himself in awful pride
Art thou a visionary of Jesus the soft delusion of Eternity
Lo I am God the terrible destroyer & not the Saviour
Why should the Divine Vision compell the sons of Eden to forego each his own delight to war against his Spectre
The Spectre is the Man the rest is only delusion & fancy

So spoke the Prince of Light & sat beside the Seat of Los
Upon the sandy shore rested his chariot of fire

Ten thousand thousand were his hosts of spirits on the wind:
Ten thousand thousand glittering Chariots shining in the sky:
They pour upon the golden shore beside the silent ocean.
Rejoicing in the Victory & the heavens were filld with blood *
[[illegible text]]

The Earth spread forth her table wide. the Night a silver cup
Fill'd with the wine of anguish waited at the golden feast
But the bright Sun was not as yet; he filling all the expanse
Slept as a bird in the blue shell that soon shall burst away
[] [Los saw the wound of his blow he saw he pitied he wept] *
{This is the line as Erdman gives it, but does not remark that the line is nearly illegible in the manuscript and appears to be written in pencil and erased.GD} Los now repented that he had smitten Enitharmon he felt love
Arise in all his Veins he threw his arms around her loins To heal the wound of his smiting
They eat the fleshly bread, they drank the nervous [bloody] wine *

They melt the bones of Vala, & the bones of Luvah into wedges
The innumerable sons & daughters of Luvah closd in furnaces
Melt into furrows. winter blows his bellows: Ice & Snow
Tend the dire anvils. Mountains mourn & Rivers faint & fail
There is no City nor Corn-field nor Orchard! All is Rock & Sand
There is no Sun nor Moon nor Star. but rugged wintry rocks
Jostling together in the void suspended by inward fires
Impatience now no longer can endure. Distracted Luvah
Bursting forth from the loins of Enitharmon, Thou fierce Terror
Go howl in vain, Smite Smite his fetters Smite O wintry hammers
Smite Spectre of Urthona, mock the fiend who drew us down
From heaven of joy into this Deep. Now rage but rage in vain
Thus sang the Demons of the Deep. the Clarions of War blew loud
The Feast redounds & Crownd with roses & the circling vine
The Enormous Bride & Bridegroom sat, beside them Urizen
With faded radiance sighd, forgetful of the flowing wine
And of Ahania his Pure Bride but She was distant far
But Los & Enitharmon sat in discontent & scorn
Craving the more the more enjoying, drawing out sweet bliss
From all the turning wheels of heaven & the chariots of the Slain
At distance Far in Night repelld. In direful hunger craving
Summers & Winters round revolving in the frightful deep.

[[And]] Enion blind & age bent wept upon the desolate wind
Why does the Raven cry aloud and no eye pities her?
Why fall the Sparrow & the Robin in the foodless winter?
[[Why...... & ..........]]Faint! Shivering they sit on leafless bush, or frozen stone
Wearied with seeking food across the snowy waste; the little
Heart, cold; and the little tongue consum'd, that once in thoughtless joy
Gave songs of gratitude to [[the]]waving corn fields round their nest.
Why howl[[s] the Lion & the Wolf? Why do they roam abroad?
Deluded by [the] summers heat they sport in enormous love
And cast their young out to the [?]] hungry wilds & sandy desarts
PAGE 18 {This text on this page was written on top of a rough sketch of a figure in a diving position.GD}
Why is the Sheep given to the knife? The Lamb plays in the Sun
He starts! he hears the foot of Man! He says, Take thou my wool
But spare my life, but he knows not that the winter cometh fast
The Spider sits in his labourd Web, eager watching for the Fly
Presently comes a famishd Bird & takes away the Spider
His Web is left all desolate, that his little anxious heart
So careful wove; & spread it out with sighs and weariness.
This was the Lamentation of Enion round the golden Feast
[[End of the First Night]]y
Eternity groand and was troubled at the image of Eternal Death
Without the body of Man an Exudation from his sickning limbs
Now Man was come to the Palm tree & to the Oak of Weeping
Which stand upon the edge of Beulah & he sunk down
From the Supporting arms of the Eternal Saviour; who disposd
The pale limbs of his Eternal Individuality
Upon The Rock of Ages. Watching over him with Love & Care
End of the First Night

Night the [Second]


{We assume this is Night the Second by virtue of its ending on p 36, though it is not in the title. Evidently Blake tried it as Night the Third and as Night the First at least twice. SAS Note further that in Night One, page 9, Blake had inserted "Night the Second", even though the end of the First Night One is indicated on page 22. LFS} 
Rising upon his Couch of Death Albion beheld his Sons 
Turning his Eyesoutward to Self. losing the Divine Vision 
[The] Albion Man calld Urizen & said. Behold these sickning Spheres {The Man is erased from the 1st rendition and Albion is set in its place. SAS} 
Whence is this Voice of Enion that soundeth in my ears Porches
Take thou possession! take this Scepter! go forth in my might 
For I am weary, & must sleep in the dark sleep of Death {According to Erdman's notes this line was crossed out in pencil for deletion and a replacement was written in the right margin, then the deleting lines and the replacement were thoroughly erased. The line leavess these traces: ??Remember? O ?Urizen/ Cxxxg / xxdxding / xxxvns? SAS} 
Thy brother Luvah hath smitten me but pity thou his youth 
Tho thou hast not pitid my Age O Urizen Prince of Light {According to Erdman, "Blake first wrote and erased a different text for 8, ending ?of fallen man?;" SAS} 
Urizen rose from the bright Feast like a star thro' the evening sky 
Exulting at the voice that calld him from the Feast of envy {"Indignant" and "Feast of envy" were in both the first and final rendition of this line. Blake considered altering "Exulting" to "Indignant" and "Feast of envy" to "Feast of love" in the second rendition, but later changed his mind and returned to the original. SAS} 
First he beheld the body of Man pale, cold, the horrors of death 
Beneath his feet shot thro' him as he stood in the Human Brain 
And all its golden porches grew pale with his sickening light 
No more Exulting for he saw Eternal Death beneath 
Pale he beheld futurity; pale he beheld the Abyss 
Where Enion blind & age bent wept in direful hunger craving 
All rav'ning like the hungry worm, & like the silent grave 
PAGE 24
Mighty was the draught of Voidness to draw Existence in 
Terrific Urizen strode above, in fear & pale dismay 
He saw the indefinite space beneath & his soul shrunk with horror 
His feet upon the verge of Non Existence; his voice went forth {According to Erdman, this line was at one time followed by a line that has been erased. Erdman has recoverd a portion of the line, reading: Above him he xxx Jerusalem ?in ?the bloody ?Heaven as xxx xxx his eyes. SAS} 
Luvah & Vala trembling & shrinking, beheld the great Work master {According to Erdman, the first rendition of the line read "beheld the lord of ?day" rather than "beheld the great Work master". SAS} 
And heard his Word! Divide ye bands influence by influence 
Build we a Bower for heavens darling in the grizly deep 
Build we the Mundane Shell around the Rock of Albion {Blake's rendering of this line is distinctly different from the surrounding text in form, though no indication of why is apparent. SAS}
The Bands of Heaven flew thro the air singing & shouting to Urizen [the lord ] 
Some fix'd the anvil, some the loom erected, some the plow 
And harrow formd & framd the harness of silver & ivory 
The golden compasses, the quadrant & the rule & balance 
They erected the furnaces, they formd the anvils of gold beaten in mills 
Where winter beats incessant, fixing them firm on their base 
The bellows began to blow & the Lions of Urizen stood round the anvil 
PAGE 25
And the leopards coverd with skins of beasts tended the roaring fires 
Sublime distinct their lineaments divine of human beauty {Erdman notes that there is a pencil line here followed by erased pencil lines in the right margin." SAS} 
The tygers of wrath called the horses of instruction from their mangers 
They unloos'd them & put on the harness of gold & silver & ivory 
In human forms distinct they stood round Urizen prince of Light 
Petrifying all the Human Imagination into rock & sand {Erdman notes here that the insertion from line 6-33 begins in a stanza break and continues in the right margin. SAS} 
Groans ran along Tyburns brook and along the River of Oxford 
Among the Druid Temples. Albion groand on Tyburns brook 
Albion gave his loud death groan The Atlantic Mountains trembled 
Aloft the Moon fled with a cry the Sun with streams of blood 

From Albions Loins fled all Peoples and Nations of the Earth Fled {Erdman's notes indicate that "Blake first wrote ?Fled? at the end of this line, then deleted it and began his new line with this word". SAS} 
Fled with the noise of Slaughter & the stars of heaven Fled 
Jerusalem came down in a dire ruin over all the Earth 
She fell cold from Lambeths Vales in groans & Dewy death 
The dew of anxious souls the death-sweat of the dying 

In every pillard hall & arched roof of Albions skies 
The brother & the brother bathe in blood upon the Severn 
The Maiden weeping by. The father & the mother with 
The Maidens father & her mother fainting over the body 
And the Young Man the Murderer fleeing over the mountains 

Reuben slept on Penmaenmawr & Levi slept on Snowdon 
Their eyes their ears nostrils & tongues roll outward they behold 
What is within now seen without they are raw to the hungry wind 
They become Nations far remote in a little & dark Land 
The Daughters of Albion girded around their garments of Needlework 

Stripping Jerusalems curtains from mild demons of the hills 
Across Europe & Asia to China & Japan like lightenings 
They go forth & return to Albion on his rocky couch 
Gwendolen Ragan Sabrina Gonorill Mehetabel Cordella 
Boadicea Conwenna Estrild Gwinefrid Ignoge Cambel 

Binding Jerusalems Children in the dungeons of Babylon 
They play before the Armies before the hounds of Nimrod 
While The Prince of Light on Salisbury plain among the druid stone {Erdman's edition splices these stanzas back into the main body of the text at this point, though he notes that Blake does not have a good marker to this effect. Erdman indicates that a linking line "must have been dropped in transcribing from working notes." SAS} 
Rattling the adamantine chains & hooks heave up the ore 
In mountainous masses, plung'd in furnaces, & they shut & seald 
The furnaces a time & times; all the while blew the North 
His cloudy bellows & the South & East & dismal West 
And all the while the plow of iron cut the dreadful furrows 
In Ulro beneath Beulah where the Dead wail Night & Day {Again, Blake's rendering of this line is distinctly different from the surrounding text in form, though no indication of why is apparent. SAS} 
Luvah was cast into the Furnaces of affliction & sealed 
And Vala fed in cruel delight, the furnaces with fire 
Stern Urizen beheld urg'd by necessity to keep 
The evil day afar, & if perchance with iron power 
He might avert his own despair; in woe & fear he saw 
PAGE 26
Vala incircle round the furnaces where Luvah was clos'd 
In joy she heard his howlings, & forgot he was her Luvah 
With whom she walkd in bliss, in times of innocence & youth 
Hear ye the voice of Luvah from the furnaces of Urizen 
If I indeed am Valas King [Luvahs Lord] & ye O sons of Men 
The workmanship of Luvahs hands; in times of Everlasting 
When I calld forth the Earth-worm from the cold & dark obscure 
I nurturd her I fed her with my rains & dews, she grew 
A scaled Serpent, yet I fed her tho' she hated me 
Day after day she fed upon the mountains in Luvahs sight 
I brought her thro' the Wilderness, a dry & thirsty land 
And I commanded springs to rise for her in the black desart 
Till she became a Dragon winged bright & poisonous {Erdman notes that a revision was made to this line while it was still wet mending "fordemon" to "Dragon". SAS} 
I opend all the floodgates of the heavens to quench her thirst 
PAGE 27
And I commanded the Great deep to hide her in his hand 
Till she became a little weeping Infant a span long 
I carried her in my bosom as a man carries a lamb 
I loved her I gave her all my soul & my delight 
I hid her in soft gardens & in secret bowers of Summer 
Weaving mazes of delight along the sunny Paradise 
Inextricable labyrinths, She bore me sons & daughters 
And they have taken her away & hid her from my sight 
They have surrounded me with walls of iron & brass, [I die] O Lamb {According to Erdman's edition, the words "I die" were erased and replaced with "O Lamb." The following four lines were written over lines erased by Blake; they cannot now be retrieved. KAU} 
Of God clothed in Luvahs garments little knowest thou 
Of death Eternal that we all go to Eternal Death 
To our Primeval Chaos in fortuitous concourse of incoherent 
Discordant principles of Love & Hate I suffer affliction 
Because I love for I am I was love & but hatred awakes in me 
And Urizen who was Faith & Certainty is changd to Doubt 
The hand of Urizen is upon me because I blotted out 
That Human terror delusion to deliver all the sons of God 
From bondage of the Human form, O first born Son of Light 
O Urizen my enemy I weep for thy stern ambition 
But weep in vain O when will you return Vala the Wanderer
PAGE 28
These were the words of Luvah patient in afflictions {This line written over a pencilled line; Erdman posits that the word under "from" is "Los." KAU} 
Reasoning from the loins in the unreal forms of Ulros night 
And when Luvah age after age was quite melted with woe 
The fires of Vala faded like a shadow cold & pale 
An evanescent shadow. last she fell a heap of Ashes 
Beneath the furnaces a woful heap in living death 
Then were the furnaces unscald with spades & pickaxes {Alternate reading of "unsealed" for "unscaled." KAU} 
Roaring let out the fluid, the molten metal ran in channels 
Cut by the plow of ages held in Urizens strong hand 
In many a valley, for the Bulls of Luvah dragd the Plow 
With trembling horror pale aghast the Children of Men Man 
Stood on the infinite Earth & saw these visions in the air 
In waters & in Earth beneath they cried to one another 
What are we terrors to one another - Come O brethren wherefore 
Was this wide Earth spread all abroad. not for wild beasts to roam 
But many stood silent & busied in their families 
And many said We see no Visions in the darksom air 
Measure the course of that sulphur orb that lights the dismal darksom day 
Set stations on this breeding Earth & let us buy & sell 
Others arose & schools Erected forming Instruments 
To measure out the course of heaven. Stern Urizen beheld 
In woe his brethren & his Sons in darkning woe lamenting 
Upon the winds in clouds involvd Uttering his voice in thunders 
Commanding all the work with care & power & severity 
Then siezd the Lions of Urizen their work, & heated in the forge 
Roar the bright masses, thund'ring beat the hammers, many a Globe pyramid {Lowercase "globe" mended to "Globe," then struck.KAU} 
Is form'd & thrown down thund'ring into the deeps of Non Entity 
Heated red hot they hizzing rend their way down many a league 
Till resting. each his center basement finds; suspended there they stand {According to Erdman, the word "center" was originally deleted by Blake with a strong ink stroke and therefore not easily erased. He later changed his mind and incorporated it into the text. KAU} 
Casting their sparkies dire abroad into the dismal deep {Alternate reading of "sparkles" for "sparkies." KAU} 
For measurd out in orderd spaces the Sons of Urizen {Lowecase "sons" mended to "Sons." KAU} 
With compasses divide the deep; they the strong scales erect 
PAGE 29
That Luvah rent from the faint Heart of the [Eternal] [Ancient] Fallen Man {The word "Ancient" written in pencil, then erased. KAU} 
And weigh the massy Globes Cubes, then fix them in their awful stations 
And all the time in Caverns shut, the golden Looms erected 
First spun, then wove the Atmospheres, there the Spider & Worm 
Plied the wingd shuttle piping shrill thro' all the list'ning threads 
Beneath the Caverns roll the weights of lead & spindles of iron 
The enormous warp & woof rage direful in the affrighted deep 
While far into the vast unknown, the strong wing'd Eagles bend 
Their venturous flight, in Human forms distinct; thro darkness deep 
They bear the woven draperies; on golden hooks they hang abroad 
The universal curtains & spread out from Sun to Sun 
The vehicles of light, they separate the furious particles
Into mild currents as the water mingles with the wine. 
While thus the Spirits of strongest wing enlighten the dark deep 
The threads are spun & the cords twisted & drawn out; then the weak 
Begin their work; & many a net is netted; many a net 
PAGE 30
Spread & many a Spirit caught, innumerable the nets 
Innumerable the gins & traps; & many a soothing flute 
Is form'd & many a corded lyre, outspread over the immense 
In cruel delight they trap the listeners, & in cruel delight 
Bind them, [together] condensing the strong energies into little compass 
Some became seed of every plant that shall be planted; some 
The bulbous roots, thrown up together into barns & garners 
Then rose the Builders: First the Architect divine his plan 
Unfolds, The wondrous scaffold reard all round the infinite 
Quadrangular the building rose the heavens squared by a line. Trigon & cubes divide the elements in finite bonds 
Multitudes without number work incessant: the hewn stone
Is placd in beds of mortar mingled with the ashes of Vala {Alternate reading of "on" for "in." KAU} 
Severe the labour, female slaves the mortar trod oppressed 
Twelve halls after the names of his twelve sons composd 
The golden wondrous building & three [centr f[orm]] Central Domes after the Names {Erdman posits that Blake erased the words "centr f[orm]" and replaced them with "Central Domes." KAU} 
Of his three daughters were encompassd by the twelve bright halls 
Every hall surrounded by bright Paradises of Delight 
In which are towns & Cities Nations Seas Mountains & Rivers {Minor grammatical changes, in tense ("were" mended to "are") and capitalization ("mountains" to "Mountains") KAU} 
Each Dome opend toward four halls & the Three Domes Encompassd 
The Golden Hall of Urizen whose western side glowd bright 
With ever streaming fires beaming from his awful limbs 
His Shadowy Feminine Semblance here reposd on a [bright] White Couch 
Or hoverd oer his Starry head & when he smild she brightend 
Like a bright Cloud in harvest. but when Urizen frownd She wept 
In mists over his carved throne & when he turnd his back 
Upon his Golden hall & sought the Labyrinthine porches 
Of his wide heaven Trembling, cold in paling fears she sat 
A Shadow of Despair therefore toward the West Urizen formd 
A recess in the wall for fires to glow upon the pale 
Females limbs in his absence & her Daughters oft upon 
A Golden Altar burnt perfumes with Art Celestial formd 

Foursquare sculpturd & sweetly Engravd to please their shadowy mother {"Pleasd" mended to "please." KAU} 
As[c]ending into her cloudy misty garments the blue smoke rolld to revive 
Her cold limbs in the absence of her Lord. Also her sons 
With lives of Victims sacrificed upon an altar of brass 
On the East side. Revivd her Soul with lives of beasts & birds 
Slain on the Altar up ascending into her cloudy bosom 
Of terrible workmanship the Altar labour of ten thousand Slaves 
One thousand Men of wondrous power spent their lives in its formation 
It stood on twelve steps namd after the names of her twelve sons 
And was Erected at the chief entrance of Urizens hall 

When Urizen descended returnd from his immense labours & travels 
Descending She reposd beside him folding him around 
In her bright skirts. Astonishd & Confounded he beheld 
Her shadowy form now Separate he shudderd & was silent 
Till her caresses & her tears revivd him to life & joy 
Two wills they had two intellects & not as in times of old 
This Urizen percievd & silent brooded in darkning Clouds 
To him his Labour was but Sorrow & his Kingdom was Repentance 
He drave the Male Spirits all away from Ahania {Alternate reading of "drove" for "drave." KAU} 
And she drave all the Females from him away {Alternate reading of "drove" for "drave." KAU}
Los joyd & Enitharmon laughd, saying Let us go down 
And see this labour & sorrow; They went down to see the woes 
Of Vala & the woes of Luvah, to draw in their delights 
And Vala like a shadow oft appeard to Urizen 
PAGE 31
The King of Light beheld her mourning among the Brick kilns compelld 
To labour night & day among the fires, her lamenting voice 
Is heard when silent night returns & the labourers take their rest 
O Lord wilt thou not look upon our sore afflictions 
Among these flames incessant labouring, our hard masters laugh 
At all our sorrow. We are made to turn the wheel for water 
To carry the heavy basket on our scorched shoulders, to sift 
The sand & ashes, & to mix the clay with tears & repentance 
I see not Luvah as of old 
I only see his feet Like pillars 
of fire travelling thro darkness 
& non entity {These four lines are placed to the right of the main body of text. Erdman does not note this placement in his edition. KAU} 
The times are now returnd upon us, we have given ourselves 
To scorn and now are scorned by the slaves of our enemies 
Our beauty is coverd over with clay & ashes, & our backs 
Furrowd with whips, & our flesh bruised with the heavy basket 
Forgive us O thou piteous one whom we have offended, forgive 
The weak remaining shadow of Vala that returns in sorrow to thee. 
Thus she lamented day & night, compelld to labour & sorrow 
Luvah in vain her lamentations heard; in vain his love 
Brought him in various forms before her still she knew him not 
PAGE 32
Still she despisd him, calling on his name & knowing him not 
Still hating still professing love, still labouring in the smoke 
And Los & Enitharmon joyd, they drank in tenfold joy To come in 
From all the sorrow of Luvah & the labour of Urizen {These two lines struck through, but then marked (to the right of the main body of text) with the following: "To come in." KAU} 
And Enitharmon joyd Plotting to rend the secret cloud 
To plant divisions in the Soul of Urizen & Ahania 
But For infinitely beautiful the wondrous work arose {Erdman notes that the word "For" has been deleted in Blake. It is not so marked in the manuscript text. KAU} 
In [ songs & joy ] sorrow & care. a Golden World whose porches round the heavens 
And pillard halls & rooms recievd the eternal wandering stars 
A wondrous golden Building; many a window many a door 
And many a division let in & out into the vast unknown 
[Cubed] Circled in infinite orb immoveable, within its arches all walls & cielings {According to Erdman, "The second reading is erased; yet it is supported by the reference back to "Cubes" and "window" in 33:4-5. If ears are porches, mouth, nose, and eyes had better be doors and windows; yet the concept of micromacrocosm is better expressed in "infinite orb immoveable," with its matching of the oxymoron in "primum mobile." If Blake hesitated to choose either reading, an editor hesitates to reject either." KAU} 
The heavens were closd & and spirits mournd their bondage night and day 
And the Divine Vision appeard in Luvahs robes of blood {This line written over an erased line, possibly ending "within." KAU} 
Thus was the Mundane shell builded by Urizens strong power 
Sorrowing Then went the Planters forth to plant, the Sowers forth to sow 
They dug the channels for the rivers & they pourd abroad 
PAGE 33
The seas & lakes, they reard the mountains & the rocks & hills 
On broad pavilions, on pillard roofs & porches & high towers 
In beauteous order, thence arose soft clouds & exhalations 
Wandering even to the sunny orbs Cubes of light & heat {Lowercase "cubes" mended to "Cubes." KAU} 
For many a window ornamented with sweet ornaments 
Lookd out into the World of Tharmas, where in ceaseless torrents {Lowercase "world" mended to "World." KAU} 
His billows roll where monsters wander in the foamy paths 
On clouds the Sons of Urizen beheld Heaven walled round {Irretrievable word following "beheld." KAU} 
They weighd & orderd all & Urizen [in comfort saw] comforted saw {The erased phrase "in comfort saw" is speculation on Erdman's part. KAU} 
The wondrous work flow forth like visible out of the invisible 
For the Divine Lamb Even Jesus who is the Divine Vision 
Permitted all lest Man should fall into Eternal Death 
For when Luvah sunk down himself put on the robes of blood 
Lest the state calld Luvah should cease. & the Divine Vision 
Walked in robes of blood till he who slept should awake {Lines 11-15 were written over four revised and erased lines, most of which is irretrievable. KAU} 
Thus were the stars of heaven created like a golden chain 
To bind the Body of Man to heaven from falling into the Abyss 
Each took his station, & his course began with [songs & joy] [eternal fear] sorrow & care {'songs & joy' is erased in-line, while 'eternal fear' is written below the line and then erased. EJC}

And to his sons in their degrees & to his beauteous daughters {'In sevens & tens...his beauteous daughters' - these 3 lines appear at the end of page 33 as a separate 3-line stanza after the section ending '...in the vast deep.' However, Blake seems to indicate a re-sequencing of the material to the order shown here, indicating the insertion of these 3 lines with a letter X at their head and a corresponding X at the end of the preceding section [ending '...sorrow & care']. According to Erdman, this change was made while 'sorrow & care' was in its earlier form, 'eternal fear.' Also according to Erdman, it was later that Blake added the numbers 1 [at insertion point], 2 [at the head of these new lines], and 3 [at the head of the section beginning 'travelling in silent majesty...'] to confirm this as a final order.

Descending sweet upon the wind among soft harps & voices [Laughing and mocking ?Luvah breaking in the woes of Vala] {Erdman suggests that 'breaking' is a word from an unrelated layer of ms, and 'woes of Vala' as previously misrecognised in Ellis' transcription as 'womb of Vala' EJC}

To plant divisions in the Soul of Urizen & Ahania 
To conduct the Voice of Enion to Ahanias midnight pillow 
Urizen saw & envied & his imagination was filled 
Repining he contemplated the past in his bright sphere 
Terrified with his heart & spirit at the visions of futurity 
That his dread fancy formd before him in the unformd void 
For Now Los & Enitharmon walkd forth on the dewy Earth 
Contracting or expanding their all flexible senses 
At will to murmur in the flowers small as the honey bee 
At will to stretch across the heavens & step from star to star 
Or standing on the Earth erect, or on the stormy waves 
Driving the storms before them or delighting in sunny beams 
While round their heads the Elemental Gods kept harmony 
Thus livd Los driving Enion far into the deathful infinite {According to Erdman, there is some partially recoverable erased material written above this line and in the margin: '?From ? Ahanias woe all XXX XXX only wrath & Envy follows in XXX their fXXXds / Urizen saw and aXXX.' EJC}

Ah happy blindness [she] Enion sees not the terrors of the uncertain 
And oft thus she wails from the dark deep, the golden heavens tremble {Of the 100 lines that make up p.34, only 19 comprise the standard text block; the rest are marginal additions, with 2 sizeable columns at the foot of the page, a 5-line stanza written up the lower righthand side of the page, and 2 additional larger stanzas appearing in the lefthand margin. Although Erdman does not address this issue in his notes, he does make some silent decisions regarding the order of the text, the most significant being his placement of this 4-line stanza at the very end of his transcription of p.34. Given his lack of explanation, this in particular would seem somewhat arbitrary; although there do appear to be some markings on the page which could be suggestions for the re-ordering of the material, these do not seem conclusive enough to justify this silent alteration to the text as it appears in the Erdman edition. Instead, the text is shown here in the order in which it appears on the page; in agreement with Erdman, the marginal material seems to flow most logically as the bottom of the page, moving to the stanza in the right margin and then concluding with the material in the left margin EJC} 
And Los said. Lo the Lilly pale & the rose reddning fierce 
Reproach thee & the beamy gardens sicken at thy beauty {According to Erdman, beneath and below these 2 lines are about 11 erased pencil lines, the first [partially recovered] beginning 'XXX she wails,' the following 2 the same as the existing lines, and the remainder apparently different from the final text EJC}

Enitharmon answerd Wherefore didst thou throw thine arms around 
Ahanias Image I decievd thee & will still decieve 
Urizen saw thy sin & hid his beams in darkning Clouds 
I still keep watch altho I tremble & wither across the heavens 
In strong vibrations of fierce jealousy for thou art mine 
Created for my will my slave tho strong tho I am weak {This line appears to have been inserted between 2 existing lines. EJC} 
Farewell the God calls me away I depart in my sweet bliss 

She fled vanishing on the wind And left a dead cold corse 
In Los's arms howlings began over the body of death {Line written over erased text. EJC} 
Los spoke. Thy God in vain shall call thee if by my strong power 
I can infuse my dear revenge into his glowing breast 
Then jealousy shall shadow all his mountains & Ahania 
Curse thee thou plague of woful Los & seek revenge on thee 
So saying in deep sobs he languishd till dead he also fell 
Night passd & Enitharmon eer the dawn returnd in bliss 
She sang Oer Los reviving him to Life his groans were terrible 
But thus she sang. I seize the sphery harp I strike the strings {As Erdman notes, these 2 lines began as 1, 'She sang Oer Los. I seize the sphery harp I strike the strings.' Above the 2nd part, Blake added 'reviving...terrible,' while below the 1st part he added 'But thus she sang,' making the present 2 lines. It makes sense to concur with Erdman in assuming that Blake forgot to move the stop after 'Los' to position it after 'sang' when making these changes, and to alter the punctuation accordingly. EJC} 

At the first Sound the Golden sun arises from the Deep 
And shakes his awful hair 
The Eccho wakes the moon to unbind her silver locks 
The golden sun bears on my song 
And nine bright spheres of harmony rise round the fiery King 

The joy of woman is the Death of her most best beloved 
Who dies for Love of her 
In torments of fierce jealousy & pangs of adoration 
The Lovers night bears on my song 
And the nine Spheres rejoice beneath my powerful controll 

They sing unceasing to the notes of my immortal hand 
The solemn silent moon 
Reverberates the living harmony upon my limbs 
The birds & beasts rejoice & play 
And every one seeks for his mate to prove his inmost joy 

Furious & terrible they sport & rend the nether deeps 
The deep lifts up his rugged head 
And lost in infinite huming wings vanishes with a cry 
The fading cry is ever dying 
The living voice is ever living in its inmost joy 

Arise you little glancing wings & sing your infant joy 
Arise & drink your bliss 
For every thing that lives is holy for the source of life 
Descends to be a weeping babe 
For the Earthworm renews the moisture of the sandy plain 

Now my left hand I stretch to earth beneath 
And strike the terrible string 
I wake sweet joy in dens of sorrow & I plant a smile 
In forests of affliction 
And wake the bubbling springs of life in regions of dark death 

O I am weary lay thine hand upon me or I faint 
I faint beneath these beams of thine 
For thou hast touchd my five senses & they answerd thee 
Now I am nothing & I sink 
And on the bed of silence sleep till thou awakest me 

Thus sang the Lovely one in Rapturous delusive trance 
Los heard delighted reviving he siezd her in his arms delusive hopes 
Kindling She led him into Shadows & thence fled outstretchd 
Upon the immense like a bright rainbow weeping & smiling & fading

I am made to sow the thistle for wheat; the nettle for a nourishing dainty 
I have planted a false oath in the earth, it has brought forth a poison tree 
I have chosen the serpent for a councellor & the dog 
For a schoolmaster to my children 
I have blotted out from light & living the dove & nightingale 
And I have caused the earth worm to beg from door to door 
I have taught the thief a secret path into the house of the just 
I have taught pale artifice to spread his nets upon the morning 
My heavens are brass my earth is iron my moon a clod of clay 
My sun a pestilence burning at noon & a vapour of death in night 
What is the price of Experience do men buy it for a song 
Or wisdom for a dance in the street? No it is bought with the price 
Of all that a man hath his house his wife his children 
Wisdom is sold in the desolate market where none come to buy 
And in the witherd field where the farmer plows for bread in vain 
It is an easy thing to triumph in the summers sun 
And in the vintage & to sing on the waggon loaded with corn 
It is an easy thing to talk of patience to the afflicted 
To speak the laws of prudence to the houseless wanderer 
PAGE 36 
To listen to the hungry ravens cry in wintry season 
When the red blood is filld with wine & with the marrow of lambs 
It is an easy thing to laugh at wrathful elements 
To hear the dog howl at the wintry door, the ox in the slaughter house moan 
To see a god on every wind & a blessing on every blast 
To hear sounds of love in the thunder storm that destroys our enemies house 
To rejoice in the blight that covers his field, & the sickness that cuts off his children 
While our olive & vine sing & laugh round our door & our children bring fruits & flowers 
Then the groan & the dolor are quite forgotten & the slave grinding at the mill 
And the captive in chains & the poor in the prison, & the soldier in the field 
When the shatterd bone hath laid him groaning among the happier dead 
It is an easy thing to rejoice in the tents of prosperity 
Thus could I sing & thus rejoice, but it is not so with me! 
[End of the Second Night] 
Ahania heard the Lamentation & a swift Vibration 
Spread thro her Golden frame. She rose up eer the dawn of day 
When Urizen slept on his couch. drawn thro unbounded space 
Onto the margin of Non Entity the bright Female came 
There she beheld the terrible Spectrous form of Enion in the Void 
And never from that moment could she rest upon her pillow 
End of the Second Night
