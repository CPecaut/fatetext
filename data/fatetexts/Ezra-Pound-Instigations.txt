INSTIGATIONSA STUDY IN FRENCH POETSThe time when the intellectual affairs of America could be conducted on a monolingual basis is over. It has been irksome for long. The intellectual life of London is dependent on people who understand the French language about as well as their own. America's part in contemporary culture is based chiefly upon two men familiar with Paris : Whistler and Henry James. It is something in the nature of a national disgrace that a New Zealand paper, "The Triad," should be more alert to, and have better regular criticism of, contem- porary French publications than any American period- ical has yet had.I had wished to give but a brief anthology * of French poems, interposing no comment of my own between author and reader; confining my criticism to selection. But that plan was not feasible. I was indebted to MM. Davray and Valette for cordial semi-permissions to quote the "Mercure" publications.Certain delicate wines will not travel; they are not always the best wines. Foreign criticism may some- times correct the criticism du cru. I cannot pretend to* The Little Review, February, 1918. 3;?4 INSTIGATIONSgive the reader a summary of contemporary French opinion, but certain French poets have qualities strong enough to be perceptible to me, that is, to at least one alien reader; certain things are translatable from one language to another, a tale or an image will "translate ; music will, practically, never translate; and if a work be taken abroad in the original tongue, certain proper- ties seem to become less apparent, or less important. Fancy styles, questions of local "taste," lose importance. Even though I know the overwhelming importance of technique, technicalities in a foreign tongue cannot have for me the importance they have to a man writing m that tongue; almost the pnly technique perceptible to a foreigner is the presentation of content as free as pos- sible from the clutteration of dead technicalities, fustian a la Louis XV; and from timidities of workmanship. This is perhaps the only technique that ever matters, theonly mcEstria.Mediocre poetry is, I think, the same everywherethere is not the slightest need to import it; we search foreign tongues for mcestria and for discoveries not yet revealedinthehomeproduct. Thecriticofaforeign literature must know a reasonable amount of the bad poetry of the nation he studies if he is to attain any sense of proportion.He will never be as sensitive to fine shades of lan- guage as the native ; he has, however, a chance of being less bound, less allied to some group of writers. It would be politic for me to praise as many living French- men as possible, and thereby to increase the number of my chances for congenial acquaintance on my next trip to Paris, and to have a large number of current French books sent to me to review.But these rather broad and general temptations can?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS5scarcely lead me to praise one man instead of another. If I have thrown over current French opinion, I must urge that foreign opinion has at times been a corrective. England has never accepted the continental opinion of Byron; the right estimate lies perhaps between the two. Heine is, I have heard, better read outside Germany than within. The continent has never accepted the idiotic British adulaition of Milton; on the other hand, the idiotic neglect of Landor has never been rectified by thecontinent.Foreign criticism, if honest, can never be quite thesame as home criticism: it may be better or worse; it may have a value similar to that of a different decade or century and has at least some chance of escaping whims and stampedes of opinion.I do not "aim at completeness." I believe that the American-English reader has heard in a general way of Baudelaire and Verlaine and Mallarme; that Mallarme, perhaps unread, is apt to be slightly overestimated; that Gautier's reputation, despite its greatness, is not yet as great as it should be.After a man has lived a reasonable time with the two volumes of Gautier's poetry, he might pleasantly venture upon the authors whom I indicate in this essay; and he might have, I think, a fair chance of seeing them jn proper perspective. I omit certain nebulous writers because I think their work bad; I omit the Parnassiens, Samain and Heredia, firstly because their work seems to me to show little that was not already implicit in Gautier ; secondly, because America has had enough Par- nassienism--perhaps second rate, but still enough. (The verses of La Comtesse de Noailles in the "Revue d*;? Deux Mondes," and those of John Vance Cheney in "The Atlantic" once gave me an almost identical pleasure.)?6 INSTIGATIONSI do not mean that all the poems here to be quoted are ."better than Samain's "Mon ame est une infante or his "Cleopatre."..We may take it that Gautier achieved hardness in Emaux: et Camees; his earlier work did in France very much what remained for the men of "the nineties" to accomplish in England. Gautier's work done in "the thirties" shows a similar beauty, a similar sort of tech- nique. If the Parnassiens were following Gautier they fell short of his merit. Heredia was perhaps the best of them. He tried to make his individual statements more"poetic"; buthiswhole,forallthis,becomesfrigid.Samain followed him and began to go "soft"; there is in him just a suggestion of muzziness. Heredia is "hard," but there or thereabouts he ends. Gautier is intent on being "hard" ; is intent on conveying a certain verity of feeling, and he ends by being truly poetic. Heredia wants to be poetic and hard; the hardness ap- pears to him as a virtue in the poetic. And one tends to conclude, from this, that all attempts to be poetic in some manner or other, defeat their own end; whereas an intentness on the quality of the emotion to be con- veyed makes for poetry.I intend here a qualitative analysis. The work of Gautier, Baudelaire, Verlaine, Mallarme, Samain, Here- dia, and of the authors I quote here should give an idea of the sort of poetry that has been written in France during the last half century, or at least during the last fortyyears. IfIamsuccessfulinmychoice,Iwillindi- cate most of the best and even some of the half-good. Bever and Leautaud's anthology contains samples of some forty or fifty more poets.*Atestimony to the effect of anthologies, and to the prestige of Van Bever and Leautaud in forming French taste, and at the--;A STUDY IN FRENCH POETSAfter' Gautier, France produced, as nearly as I can understand, three chief and admirable poets: Tristan Corbiere, perhaps the most poignant writer since Villon Rimbaud,avivida^idindubitablegenius; andLaforguea slighter, but in some ways a finer "artist" than either of the others. I do not mean that he "writes better" than Rimbaud; and Eliot has pointed out the wrongness of Symons's phrase, "Laforgue the eternal adult, Rim- baudtheeternalchild." Rimbaud'seffectsseemoftento come as the beauty of certain silver crystals produced bychemicalmeans. Laforguealwaysknowswhatheis at; Rimbaud, the "genius" in the narrowest and deepestsense of the term, the "most modem," seems, almost without knowing it, to hit on the various ways in which the best writers were to follow him, slowly. Laforgue is the "last word" : --out of infinite knowledge of all the waysofsayingathinghefindstherightway. Rimbaud, when right, is so because he cannot be bothered to exist in any other modality.JULES LAFORGUE (i86o-'87)Laforgue was the "end of a period"; that is to say,same time the most amazing response to my French number of the Little Review, was contained in a letter from one of the very poets I had chosen to praise"Je vous remercie de m'avoir. revele Laforgue que je connais- sais seulement par les extraits publics dans la premiere An- thologie en i volume par Van Bever et Leautaud."This is also a reply to those who solemnly assured me that any foreigner attempting to criticize French poetry would meet nothing but ridicule from French authors.I am free to say that Van B. and L.'s selections would have led me neither to Laforgue nor to Rimbaud. They were, however, my approach to many of the other poets, and their two volume anthology is invaluable.:?7!:! ! ; ;?8 INSTIGATIONShe summed up and summarized and dismissed nineteenlh- century French literature, its foibles and fashions, as Flaubert in "Bouvard and Pecuchet" summed up nine- teenth-century general civilization. He satirized Flau- bert's heavy "Salammbo" manner inimitably, and he man- ages to be more than a critic, for in process of this ironic summary he conveys himself, il raconte lui-meme en racontant son age et ses moeurs, he delivers the moods and the passion of a rare and sophisticated personality: "point ce 'gaillard-la' ni le Superbe . . . mais au fond distinguee et tranche comme une herbe"Oh! laissez-moi seulement reprendre haleine, Et vous aurez un Hvre enfin de bonne foi.En attendant, ayez pitie de ma misereQue je vous sois a tous un etre bienvenuEt que je sois absous pour mon ame sincere,Comme le fut Phryne pour son sincere nu.He is one of the poets whom it is practically impossible to"select."

They must think as their readers think at a given moment.It is impossible that Jules Laforgue should have writ- ten his poems in America in "the eighties." He was born in i860, died in 1887 of la miskre, of consumption and abject poverty in Paris. The vaunted sensitiveness of French perception, and the fact that he knew a reason- able number of wealthy and influential people, did noth- ing to prevent this. He had published two small volumes, one edition of each. The seventh edition of his collected poems is dated 1913, and doubtless they have been re- printed since then with increasing celerity.!?i6 INSTIGATIONSUn couchant des Cosmogonies!Ah! que la Vie est quotidienne . . ?Et, du plus vrai qu'on se souvienne, Comme on fut pietre et sans genie. .. ?What is the man in the street to make of this, or of the Complainte des Bons Menages!L'Art sans poitrine m'a trop longtemps berce dupe.

They wish always to be ex- horted, at all times no matter how incongruous and un- suitable, to do those things which almost any one will and does do whenever suitable opportunity is presented. As Henry James has said, "It was a period when writers" besought the deep blue sea 'to roll.'The ironist is one who suggests that the reader should think, and this process being unnatural to the majority of mankind, the way of the ironical is beset with snares and with furze-bushes.Laforgue was a purge and a critic. He laughed out the errors of Flaubert, i.e., the clogging and cumbrous historical detail. He left Coeur Simple, L'Education, MadameBovary,Bouvard. HisSalomemakesgameof the rest. The short story has become vapid because sixty thousand story writers have all set themselves to imi- tating De Maupassant, perhaps a thousand from the original.Laforgue implies definitely that certain things in prose were at an end, and I think he marks the next phase after Gautier in French poetry. It seems to me that!?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS 17without a familiarity with Laforgue one can not appre- ciate--i. e., determine the value of--certain positives and certain negatives in French poetry since 1890.He deals for the most part with literary poses and clichSs, yet he makes them a vehicle for the expression of his own very personal emotionsj of his own unper- turbed sincerity.Je ne suis pas "ce gaillard-la !" ni Le Superbe Mais mon ame, qu'un cri un peu cm exacerbe,Est au fond distinguee et franche comme une herbe.This is not the strident and satiric voice of Corbiere, calling Hugo "Garde National Spique" and Lamartine "Lacrymatoire d'abonnes." It is not Tailhade drawing with rough strokes the people he sees daily in Paris, and bursting with guffaws over the Japanese in their mackin- toshes, the West Indian mulatto behind the bar in the Quartier. It is not Georges Fourest burlesquing in a cafe; Fourest's guffaw is magnificent, he is hardly satir- ical. Tailhade draws from life and indulges in occa- sional squabbles.Laforgue was a better artist than any of these men save Corbiere. He was not in the least of their sort.Beardsley's "Under the Hill" was until recently the only successful attempt to produce "anything like La- forgue" in our tongue. "Under the Hill" was issued in alimitededition. Laforgue'sMoralitesLegend<?reswas issued in England by the Ricketts and Hacon press in a limited edition, and there the thing has remained. Laforgue can never become a popular cult because tyros can not imitate him.One may discriminate between Laforgue's tone and that of his contemporary French satirists. He is the?i8 INSTIGATIONSfinest wrought; he is most "verbalist." Bad verbalism is rhetoric, or the use of clichS unconsciously, or a mere playing with phrases. But there is good verbalism, dis- tinct from lyricism or imagism, and in this Laforgue is amaster. Hewritesnotthepopularlanguageofany country, but an international tongue common to the ex- cessively cultivated, and to those more or less familiar with French litera1:ure of the first three-fourths of thenineteenth century.He has done, sketchily and brilliantly, for Frenchjit-erature a work not incomparable to what Flaubert was doing for "France" in Bouvard <md Pecuichef, if one may compare the flight of the butterfly with the progress of an ox, both proceeding toward the same point of the compass. Hehasdippedhiswingsinthedyeofscien- tific terminology. Pierrot imberbe hasUn air d'hydrocephale asperge.The tyro can not play about with such things. Verbal- ism demands a set form used with irreproachable skill. Satire needs, usually, the form of cutting rhymes to drive it home.Chautauquas, Mrs. Eddy, Dr. Dowies, Comstocks, So- cieties for the Prevention of All Human Activities, are impossible in the wake of Laforgue. And he is there- fore an exquisite poet, a deliverer of the nations, a Numa Pompilius, a father of light. And to many people this mystery, the mystery why such force should reside in so fragile a book, why such power should coincide with so great a nonchalance of manner, will remain for- ever a mystery.!?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS 19Que loin Tame type Qui m'a dit adieuParce que mes yeux Manquaierit de principesEUe, en ce moment.

He did not specifically mention Corbiere; who, with perhaps a few dozen other French poets, may have been outside the scope of his research.

His lan- guage does not need any particular subject matter, or prefer one to another. "Mannequin ideal, tete-de-turc du leurre," "Fille de marbre, en rut!", "Je voudrais etre chien a une fille publique" are all, with a constant emis- sion of equally vigorous phrases, to be found in the city poems. At his weakest he is touched with the style of his time, i. e., he falls into a phrase d la Hugo,--but sel- dom. And he is conscious of the will to break from this manner, and is the first, I think, to satirize it, or at least the first to hurl anything as apt and violent as "garde nationale epique" or "inventeur de la larme ecrite" at the Romantico-rhetorico and the sentimento-romanticoofHugoandLamartine. Hisnearestkinships in our period are to Gautier and Laforgue, though it is Villon whom most by life and temperament he must be said to resemble.Laforgue was, for four or five years, "reader" to the!?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS 29ex-Kaiser's mama; he escaped and died of la m/ishe.

Cezanne was the first to paint, as Rimbaud had written,--in, for example, "Les Assis"lis ont greflfe dans des amours epileptiquesLeur fantasque ossature aux grands squelettes noirs De leurs chaises ; leurs pieds aux barreaux rachitiques S'entrelacent pour les matins et pour les soirsCes vieillards ont toujours fait tresse avec leurs sieges. or in the octave ofVENUS ANADYOMENEComma d'un cercueil vert en fer-blanc, une tete De femme a cheveux bruns fortement pommades D'une vieille baignoire emerge, lente et bete, Montrant des deficits assez mal ravaudes;Puis le col gras et gris, les larges omoplates Qui saillent ; le dos court qui rentre et qui ressort, --La graisse sous la peau parait en feuilles plates Et les rondeurs des reins semble prendre I'essor.Tailhade has painted his "Vieilles Actrices" at greater30?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS 31length, but smiling; Rimbaud does not endanger his in- tensity by a chuckle. He is serious as Cezanne is serious. Comparisons across an art are always vague and inexact, andtherearenorealparallels; stillitispossibletothink of Corbiere a little as one thinks of Goya, without Goya's Spanish, with infinite differences, but with a macabre in- tensity, and a modernity that we have not yet surpassed. There are possible grounds for comparisons of like sort between Rimbaud and Cezanne.Tailhade and Rimbaud were both born in '54; there is not a question of priority in date, I do not know who hit first on the form, but Rimbaud's "Chercheuses" is a very good example of a mould not unlike that into which Tailhade has cast his best poems.LES CHERCHEUSES DE POUXQuand le front de I'enfant plein de rouges tourmentes.

Many readers will be unable to "see over" the subject matter and consider the virtues of the style, but we are, let us hope, serious people; besides, Rimbaud's mastery is not confined to "the un- pleasant" ; "Roman" beginsOn n'est pas serieux, quand on a dix-sept ans. --Un beau soir, foin des bocks et de la limonade, Des cafes tapageurs aux lustres eclatants--On va sous les tilleuls verts de la promenade.Les tilleuls sentent bon dans les bons soirs de juin!

One has no instant of doubt here, nor, I think, in any line of any poem of Rimbaud's. How much I might have learned from the printed page that I have learned slowlyIrom actualities. Or perhaps we never do learn from the page ; but are only capable of recognizing the page after we have learned from actuality.I do not know whether or no Rimbaud "started" the furniture poetry with "Le Buffet" ; it probably comes, most of it, from the beginning of Gautier's "Albertus." I cannot see that the "Bateau Ivre" rises above the gen- eral level of his work, though many people seem to know of this poem (and of the sonnet on the vowels) who donotknowtherestofhiswork. Bothofthesepoems are in Van Bever and Leautaud. I wonder in what other poet will we find such firmness of coloring and such certitude.TABLELaforgue 1860-1887; published 1885 Corbiere1840-1875; published1873and1891 Rimbaud 1854-1891; published 1873Remy de Gourmont 1858-1915Merril 1868-1915::?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS35Tailhade 1854-1919 Verhaeren 1855-1916 Moreas 1856-1911LivingViele-Griffin 1864Jammes 1868 De Regnier 1864 Spire 1868Younger MenKlingsor, Remains, VildracOther Dates:Verlaine 1844-1896Mallarme 1842-1898 Samain 1858-1900 Elskamp, born 1862REMY DE GOURMONT (1858-1915)As in prose, Remy de Gourmont found his own form, so also in poetry, influenced presumably by the medieval sequaires and particularly by Goddeschalk's quoted in his (De Gourmont's) work on "Le Latin Mystique," he recreated the "litanies." It was one of the great gifts of "symbolisme," of the doctrine that one should "suggest" not "present"; it is, in his hand, an effective indirectness. The procession of all beautiful women moves before one in the "Litanies de la Rose"; and the rhythm is incomparable. It is not a poem to lie on the page, it must come to life in audition, or in the finerauditionwhichonemayhaveinimaginingsound; One must "hear" it, in one way or another, and out of that?36 INSTIGATIONSintoxication comes beauty. One does no injustice to De Gourmont by giving this poem alone. The "Litany of the Trees" is of equal or almost equal beauty. The Sonnets in prose are different; they rise out of natural speech, out of conversation. Paul Fort perhaps began or rebegan the use of conversational speech in rh3miing prose paragraphs, at times charmingly.LITANIES DE LA ROSEA Henry dt Groux.Fleur hypocrite,Fleur du silence.Rose couleur de cuivre, plus frauduleuse que nos joies,rose couleur de cuivre. embaume-nous dans tes men- songes, fleur hypocrite, fleur du silence.Rose au visage peint comme une fille d'amour, rose au cceur prostitue, rose au visage peint, fais serablant d'etre pitoyable, fleur hypocrite, fleur du silence.Rose a la joue puerile, 6 vierges des futures trahisons, rose a la joue puerile, innocente et rouge, ouvre les rets de tes yeux clairs, fleur hypocrite, fleur du silence.Rose aux yeux noirs, miroir de ton neant, rose aux yeux noirs, fais-nous croire au mystere, fleur hypocrite, fleur du silence.Rose couleur d'or pur, 6 coffre-fort de I'ideal, rose couleur d'or pur, donne-nous la clef de ton ventre, fleur hypocrite, fleur du silence.Rose couleur d'argent, encensoir de nos reves, rose couleur d'argent prends notre cceur et fais-en de la fumee, fleur hypocrite, fleur du silence.Rose au regard saphique, plus pale que les lys, rose au regard saphique, offre-nous le parfum de ton illusoire virginite, fleur hypocrite, fleur du silence.?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS37Rose au front poui-pre, colere des femmes d^daignees, rose au front pourpre dis-nous le secret de ton orgueil, fleur hypocrite, fleur du silence.Rose au front d'ivoire jaune, aniante de toi-meme, rose au front d'ivoire jaune, dis-nous le secret de tes nuits virginales, fleur hypocrite, fleur du silence.Rose aux levres de sang, 6 mangeuse de chair, rose aux levres de sang, si tu veux notre sang, qu'en ferions- nous?

Hi^ "J'ai feint que les dieux m'aient parle" opens charmingly. He has in the "Odelettes" made two darts into vers libre which are perhaps worth many more orderly pages, and show lyric sweetness.ODELETTESi j'ai parleDe mon amour, c'est a I'eau lente Qui m'ecoute quand je me penche Sur elle; si j'ai parleDe mon amour, c'est au ventQui rit et cuchote entre les branchesSi j'ai parle de mon amour, c'est a I'oiseau Qui passe et chanteAvec le vent;Si j'ai parleC'est a I'echo.Si j'ai aime de grand amour, Triste ou joyeux,Ce sont tes yeux;Si j'ai aime de grand amour, Ce fut ta bouche grave et douce, Ce fut ta boucheSi j'ai aime de grand amour,Ce furent ta chair tiede et tes mains fraiches, Et c'est ton ombre que je cherche.He has joined himself to the painters of contemporary things in: r:?42INSTIGATIONSL'ACCUEILTous deux etaient beaux de corps et de visages, L'air francs et sagesAvec un clair sourire dans les yeux,Et, devant eux,Debout en leur jeunesse svelte et prompte, Je me sentais courbe et j'avais presque honte D'etre si vieux.Les ansSont lourds aux epaules et pesentAux plus fortesDe tout le poids des heures mortes,Les ansSont durs, et breveLa vie et Ton a vite des cheveux blancs; Et j'ai deja vecu beaucoup de jours.Les ans sont lourds. . . .Et tous deux me regardaient, surpris de voir Celui qu'ils croyaient autre en leur pensee Se lever pour les recevoirVetu de bure et le front nuEt non pas, comme en leur pensee.

My own feeling at the moment is that his hellenics, his verse on classical and ancient subjects, is likely to be over-?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS 45shadowed by that of Samain and Heredia. I have doubts whether his books will hold against the Cleopatra sonnets, or if he has equaled, in this vein, the poem beginning "Mon ame est une infante en robe de parade." But in the lyric odelette, and in this last given poem in particular, we find him leading perhaps onward toward Vildrac, and toward a style which might be the basis for a certain manner F. M. Hueffer has used in English vers libre, rather than remembering the Parnassiens.EMILE VERHAERENVerhaeren has been so well introduced to America by his obituary notices that I can scarcely hope to com- pete with them in this limited space. One can hardly represent him better than by the well known:LES PAUVRESII est ainsi de pauvres coeurs avec en eux, des lacs de pleurs, qui sont pales, comme les pierres d'un cimetiere.II est ainsi de pauvres dosplus lourds de peine et de fardeaux que les toits des cassines brunes, parmi les dunes.II est ainsi de pauvres mains, comme feuilles sur les chemins, comme feuilles jaunes et mortes, devant la porte.!!;;:?46INSTIGATIONSII est ainsi de pauvres yeux humbles et bons et soucieuxet plus tristes que ceux des betes, sous la tempete.II est ainsi de pauvres gens, aux gestes las et indulgents sur qui s'acharne la misere,au long des plaines de la terre.             VIELE-GRIFFINTwo men, half-Americans, Viele-Griffin and Stuart Merril, won for themselves places among the recent French poets. Viele-Griffin's poem for the death of Mallarme is among his better known worksIN MEMORIAM STEPHANE MALLARMfiSi Ton te disait : MaitreLe jour se leve;Voici une aube encore, la meme, pale Maitre, j'ai ouvert la fenetre,L'aurore s'en vient encor du seuil oriental, Un jour va naitre--Je croirais t'entendre dire : Je reve.Si Ton te disait: Maitre, nous sommes la, Vivants et forts,Comme ce soir d'hier, devant ta porteNous sommes venus en riant, nous sommes la, Guettant le sourire et I'etreinte forte,--On nous repondrait: Le Maitre est mort.;:--?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETSDes fleurs de ma terrasse,Des fleurs comme au feuillet d'un livre,Des fleurs, pourquoi?Voici un peu de nous, la chanson basseQui tourne et tombe,--Comme ces feuilles-ci tombent et toumoient Voici la honte et la colere de vivreEt de parler des mots--contre ta tombe.His curious and, perhaps not in the bad sense, old- fashioned melodic quality shows again in the poem be- ginning :Lache comme le froid et la pluie, Brutal et sourd comme le vent. Louche et faux comme le ciel has, L'Automne rode par ici,Son baton heurte aux contrevents Ouvr? la porte, car il est la.Ouvre la porte et fais-lui honte.Son manteau s'effiloche et traine,Ses pieds sont alourdis de boue; Jette-lui des pierres, quoi qu'il te conte, Ne crains pas ses paroles de haine C'est toujours un role qu'il joue.It is embroidery a la Charles D'Orl^ans; one must take it or leave it.STUART MERRILI know that I have seen somewhere a beautiful and effective ballad of Merril's. His "Chambre D'Amour"47::?48 INSTIGATIONSwould be more interesting if Samain had not written "L'Infante," but Merril's painting is perhaps interesting as comparison. It begins:Dans la chambre qui fleure un peu la bergamote, Ce soir, lasse, la voix de I'ancien clavecin Chevrote des refrains enfantins de gavotte.There is a great mass of this poetry full of highly cultured house furnishing; I think Catulle Mendes also wrote it. Merril's "Nocturne" illustrates a mode of symbolistic writing which has been since played out and parodiedLa bleme lune allume en la mare qui luit, Miroir des gloires d'or, un emoi d'incendie. Tout dort. Seul, a mi-mort, un rossignol de nuit Module en mal d'amour sa molle melodie.Plus ne vibrent les vents en le mystere vert Desramures. Laluneatuleursvoixnocturnes Mais a travers le deuil du feuillage entr'ouvert Pleuvent les bleus baisers des astres taciturnes.There is no need to take this sort of tongue-twisting too seriously, though it undoubtedly was so taken in Paris during the late eighties and early nineties. He is better illustrated in "La Wallonie," vide infra.LAURENT TAILHADE 1854-1919Tailhade's satires seem rough if one come upon them straightfromreadingLaforgue; andLaforguewillseem, and is presumably, the greatly finer artist; but one!?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS49should not fail to note certain definite differences. Laforgue is criticizing, and conveying a mood. He is more or less literary, playing with words. Tailhade is painting contemporary Paris, with verve. His eye is on the thing itself. He has, au fond, not very much incommonwithLaforgue. Hewasbomsixyearsbe- foreLaforgueandinthesameyearasRimbaud. Theirtemperaments are by no means identical. I do not know whether Tailhade wrote "Hydrotherapie" before Rimbaud had done "Les Chercheuses." Rimbaud in that poem identifies himself more or less with the child and its feeling. Tailhade is detached. I do not say this as praise of either one or the other. I am only trying to keep things distinct.          HYDROTHERAPIELe vieux monsieur, pour prendre une douche ascendante, A couronne son chef d'un casque d'hidalgoQui, malgre sa bedaine ample et son lumbago,Lui donne un certain air de famille avec Dante.Ainsi ses membres gourds et sa vertebre a point Traversent I'appareil des tuyaux et des lances, Tandis que' des masseurs, tout gonfles d'insolences, Frottent au gant de crin son dos oti I'acne point.Oh!

Landor and Swinburne have, I think, forestalled Tailhade's hellenic poems in our affections. There are also his ballades to be considered.?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS53FRANCIS JAMMES (born 1868)The bulk of Jammes' unsparable poetry is perhaps largerthanthatofanymanstilllivinginFrance. The three first books of poems, and "Le Triomphe de la Vie" containing "Existences," the more than "Spoon River" of France, must contain about six hundred pages worth reading. "Existences" can not be rendered in snippets. It is not a series of f>oems, but the canvass of a wholesmall town or half city, unique, inimitable and "to the life," full of verve. Only those who have read it and "L'Angelus de I'Aube," can appreciate the full tragedy of Jammes' debacle. Paul Fort had what his friends boasted as "tone," and he has diluted himself with topicalities ; in Jammes' case it is more charitable to sup- pose some organic malady, some definite softening of the brain, for he seems perfectly simple and naive in his debacle. It may be, in both cases, that the organisms have broken beneath the strain of modern existence.But the artist has no business to break. Let us begin with Jammes' earlier work:J'aime I'ane si doux marchant le long des houx. II prend garde aux abeilles et bouge ses oreilles;et il porte les pauvreset des sacs remplis d'orge. II va, pres des fossesd'un petit pas casse.Mon amie le croit bete?54INSTIGATIONSparce qu'il est poete.II reflechit toujours,Ses yeux sont en velours. Jeune fille au doux coeur tu n'as pas sa douceur.The fault is the fault, or danger, which Dante has labeled "muliebria"; of its excess Jammes has since perished. But the poem to the donkey can, in certain moods, please one. In other moods the playful sim- plicity, at least in excess, is almost infuriating. He runs so close to sentimentalizing--when he does not fall into that puddle--that there are numerous excuses for those who refuse him altogether. "J'allai a Lourdes" has pathos. Compare it with Corbiere's "St. Anne" and the .decadence is apparent; it is indeed a sort of half-way house between the barbaric Breton religion and the ulti- mate deliquescence of French Catholicism in Claudel, who (as I think it is James Stephens has said) "is merely lying on his back kicking his heels in it."J' ALLAIALOURDESJ'allai a Lourdes par le chemin de fer, le long du gave qui est bleu comme I'air.Au soleil les montagnes semblaient d'etain.

And there is, in many French poets, a fata proclivity to fuss just a little too much over their sub- jects. Jammes has also the furniture tendency, and tc it we owe several of his quite charming poems.How- ever the strongest impression I get to-day, reading hi; work in inverse order (i. e. "Jean de Noarrieu" befon these earlier poems), is of the very great stylistic ad-vance made in that poem over his earlier work.But he is very successful in saying all there was to besaid in:LA JEUNE FILLELa jeune fiUe est blanche, elle a des veines vertesau poignets, dans ses manchesouvertes.On ne sait pas pourquoi elle rit.

Der trog die Augen mein, ich wahnt, es sollte sein des lichten Monden Schein, da tagte es.Morungen had had no occasion to say "Je pense a Jean-Jacques," and it is foolish, to expect exactly the same charm of a twentieth-century poet that we find in a thirteenth-century poet. Still it is not necessary to be Jammes-crazy to feelILVANEIGER. . .II va neiger dans quelques jours. Je me souviens deI'andernier. Jemesouviensdemestristesses aucoindufeu.

He reaches, as I have said, his greatest verve in "Existences" in the volume "Le Triomphe de la Vie."I do not wish to speak in superlatives, but "Exist- ences," if not Jammes' best work, and if not the most important single volume by any living French poet, either of which it well may be, is at any rate indispen- sable. It is one of the first half dozen books that a man wanting to know contemporary French work must in- dulge in. One can not represent it in snippets. Still I quote "Le Poete" (his remarks at a provincial soiree) :Cest drole . . . Cette petite sera betecomme ces gens-la, comme son pere et sa mere. Et cependant elle a une grace infinie.II y a en elle I'intelligence de la beaute.Cest delicieux, son corsage qui n'existe pas,son derriere et ses pieds.

"Existences" was written in 1900.MOREASIt must not be thought that these very "modem" poets owe their modernity merely to some magic chemical present in the Parisian milieu. Moreas was born in1856, the year after Verhaeren, but his Madeline-aux- serpents might be William Morris on RapunzelEt votre chevelure comme des grappes d'ombres, Et ses bandelettes a vos tempes,Et la kabbale de vos yeux latents, Madeline-aux-serpents, Madeline.Madeline, Madeline, Pourquoi vos levres a mon cou, ah, pourquoiVos levres entre les coups du hache du roi!

The school-boys' papers of Toulouse had learnt all about it before the old:?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS 63gentlemen of The Century and Harper's had discovered that such things exist.One will not have understood the French poetry of the last half-century unless one makes allowance for what they call the Gothic as well as the Roman or classic influence. We should probably call it (their "Gothic") "medievalism," its tone is that of their XIII century poets, Crestien de Troies, Marie de France, or perhaps even D'Orleans (as we noticed in the quotation from Viele-Griffin) . Tailhade in his "Hymne Antique" dis- plays what we would call Swinburnism (Greekish). Tristan Klingsor (a nom de plume showing definite ten- dencies) exhibits these things a generation nearer to usDans son reve le vieux Prince de Touraine voit passer en robe verte a longue traine Yeldis aux yeux charmeurs de douce reine.orAu verger ou sifflent les sylphes d'automnemignonne Isabelle est venue de Veniseet veut cueillir des cerises et des pommes.He was writing rhymed vers libre in 1903', possibly stimulated by translations in a volume called "Poesie Arabe." Thisbookhasanextremelyinterestingpreface. I have forgotten the name of the translator, but in ex- cusing the simplicity of Arab songs he says : "The young girl in Germany educated in philosophy in Kant and Hegel, when love comes to her, at once exclaims 'In- finite !', and allies her vocabulary with the transcendental.:?64 .INSTIGATIONSThe little girl in the tents 'ne savait comparer fors que sa gourmandise.' " In Klingsor for 1903, I findCroise tes jambes fines et nuesDans ton lit,Frotte de tes mignonnes mains menuesLe bout de ton nez;Frotte de tes doigts poteles et jolis,Les deux violettes de tes yeux cernes,Et reve.Du haut du minaret arabe s'echappeLa melopee triste et breveDe I'indiscret muezzinQui nasillonne et qui eternue,Et toi tu bailies comme une petite chatte, Tu bailies d'amour brisee,Et tu songes au passant d'Ormuz ou d'Endor Qui t'a quittee ce matinEn te laissant sa legere bourse d'orEt les marques bleues de ses baisers.Later he turns to Max Elkskamp, addressing him as if he, Klingsor, at last had "found Jesus":Je viens vers vous, mon cher Elkskamp JComme un pauvre varlet de coeur et de joieVient vers le beau seigneur qui campe Sous sa tente d'azur et de soie.However I believe Moreas was a real poet, and, being stubborn, I have still an idea which got imbedded in my head some years ago: I mean that Klingsor is a poet.?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS 65As for the Elkskamp phase and cult, I do not make much of it. Jean de Bosschere has written a book upon Elkskamp, and he assures me that Elkskamp is a great and important poet, and some day, perhaps, I may un- derstand it. De Bosschere seems to me to see or to feel perhaps more keenly than any one else certain phases of modern mechanical civilization: the ant-like madness of men bailing out little boats they never will sail in, shoeing horses they never will ride, making chairs they never will sit on, and all with a frenzied intentness. I may get my conviction as much from his drawings as from his poems. I am not yet clear in my mind about it. His opinion of Max Elkskamp can not be too lightly passedover. Videinfra"DeBosschereonElkskamp."OF OUR DECADEEarly in 1912 L'Effort, since called L'Effort Libre, published an excellent selection of poems mostly by men born since 1880: Arcos, Chenneviere, Duhamel, Spire, Vildrac, and Jules Romains, with some of Leon Bazal- gette's translations from Whitman.SPIRE (born 1868)Andre Spire, writing in the style of the generation which has succeeded him, is well represented in this col- lectionbyhis"DamesAnciennes." Thecontentsofhis volumes are of very uneven value: Zionist propaganda, addresses, and a certain number of well-written poems.?66INSTIGATIONSDAMES ANCIENNESEn hiver, dans la chambre claire, Tout en haut de la maison,Le poele de faience blanche,Cercle de cuivre, provincial, doux, Chauffait mes doigts et mes livres.

Romains has always seemed to me, and is, I think, generally recognized as, the nerve-centre, the dynamic centre of the group.;?70 INSTIGATIONSLes marchands sont assis aux portes des boutiques lis regardent.

We live by instinct; receive news by instinct; have conquered machinery as primi- tive man conquered the jungle. Remains feels this, though his phrases may not be ours. Wyndham Lewis on giants is nearer Remains than anjrthing else in Eng- lish, but vorticism is, in the realm of biology, the hy- pothesis of the dominant cell. Lewis on giants comes perhaps nearer Remains than did the original talks about the Vortex. There is in inferior minds a passion for unity, that is, for a confusion and melting together of things which a good mind will want kept distinct. Un- informed-English criticism has treated Unanimism as if it were a vague general propaganda, and this criticism has cited some of our worst and stupidest versifiers as a corresponding manifestation in England. One can only account for such error by the very plausible hy- pothesis that the erring critics have not read "Puissances de Paris."Remains is net to be understood by extracts and frag- ments. He has felt this general replunge of mind into instinct, or this development of instinct to cope with a metropolis, and with metropolitan conditions; in so far:?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS 71as he has expressed the emotions of this consciousness he is poet; he has, aside from that, tried to formulate this new consciousness, and in so far as such formulation is dogmatic, debatable, intellectual, hyJ)othetical, he is opentoargumentanddispute; thatistosayheisphilos- opher, and his philosophy is definite and defined. Vil- drac's statement "II a change la pathetique" is perfectly true. Many people will prefer the traditional and fa- miliar and recognizable poetry of writers like Klingsor. I am not dictating people's likes and dislikes. Romains has made a new kind of poetry. Since the scrapping of the Aquinian, Dantescan system, he is perhaps the first person who had dared put up so definite a philo- sophical frame-work for his emotions.I do not mean, by this, that I agree with Jules Romains; I am prepared to go no further than my opening sentence of this section, concerning our grow- ing, or returning, or perhaps only newly-noticed, sensi- tization to crowd feeling; to the metropolis and its peculiar sensations.

Here,Icanbut touch upon salients.Rien ne cesse d'etre interieur.La rue est plus intime a cause de la brume.Lines like Romains', so well packed with thought, so careful that you will get the idea, can not be poured out by the bushel like those of contemporary rhetoricians, like those of Claudel and Fort. The best poetry has always a content, it may not be an intellectual content; in Romains the intellectual statement is necessary to keep the new emotional content coherent.The opposite of Lewis's giant appears inJe suis I'esclave heureux des hommes dont I'haleine Flotte ici. Leur vouloirs s'ecoule dans mes nerfs; Ce qui est moi commence a fondre.This statement has the perfectly simple order of words. Itisthesimplestatementofamansayingthings for the first time, whose chief concern is that he shall speak clearly. His work is perhaps the fullest statement of the poetic consciousness of our time, or the scope of that consciousness. I am not saying he is the most poignant poet; simply that in him we have the fullestpoetic exposition.You can get the feel of Laforgue or even of Corbiere:?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS 73from a few poems; Romains is a subject for study. I do not say this as praise, I am simply trying to define him. His "Un Etre en Marche" is the narrative of a girls' school, of the "crocodile" or procession going out for its orderly walk, its collective sensations and adven-, tures.Troupes and herds appear in his earlier work:Le troupeau marche, avec ses chiens et son berger, II a peur. Qk et la des reverberes brulent,II tremble d'etre poursuivi par les etoiles.La foule traine une ecume d'ombrelles blanchesLa grande ville s'evapore,Et pleut a verse sur la plaineQu'elle sature.His style is not a "model," it has the freshness of grass, not of new furniture polish. In his work many nouns meet their verbs for the first time, as, perhaps, in the'lastlinesabovequoted. Heneeds,asarule,about a hundred pages to turn round in. One can not give these poems in quotation ; one wants about five volumes of Romains. In so far as I am writing "criticism," I must say that his prose is just as interesting as his verse. But then his verse is just as interesting as his prose. Part of his method is to show his subject in a series of successive phases, thus in L'Individu'V .Je suis un habitant de ma ville, un de ceuxQui s'assoient au theatre et qui vont par les rues;?74INSTIGATIONSVIJe cesse lentement d'etre moi.

It is as useless for the disciple to try and imitate Romains, without having as much thought of his own, as it is for the tyro in words to try imitations of Jules Laforgue. The limitation of Romains' work, as of a deal of Browning's, is that, having once understood it, one may not need or care to re-read it. This restric- tion applies also in a wholly different way to "En- dymion" ; having once filled the mind with Keats' color, or the beauty of things described, one gets no new thrill from the re-reading of them in not very well-written verse. This limitation applies to all poetry that is not implicit in its own medium, that is, which is not indis- solubly bound in with the actual words, word music, the fineness and firmness of the actual writing, as in Villon, or in "Collis O Heliconii."ButonecannotleaveRomainsunread. Hisinterest is more than a prose interest, he has verse technique, rhyme, terminal syzygy, but that is not what I mean. He is poetry in:On ne m'a pas donne de lettres, ces jours-ci Personne n'a songe, dans la ville, a m'ecrire.Oh! je n'esperais rien; je sais vivre et penser Tout seul, et mon esprit, pour faire une flambee, N'attend pas qu'on lui jette une feuille noircie.;?A STUDiY IN FRENCH POETSMais je sens qu'il me manque un plaisir familier,J'ai du bonheur aux mains quand j'ouvre une enveloppe;But such statements as: TENTATION1Je me plais beaucoup trop a rester dans les gares Accoude sur le bois anguleux des barrieres,Je regarde les trains s'emplir de voyageurs.and:would not be important unless they were followed by exposition. The point is that they are followed by ex- position, to which they form a necessary introduction, defining Romains' angle of attack; and as a result the forceofRemainsiscumulative. Hisearlybooksgather meaning as one reads through the later ones.And I think if one opens him almost anywhere one can discern the authentic accent of a'man saying some- thing, not the desultory impagination of rehash.Charles Vildrac is an interesting companion figure to his brilliant friend Romains. He conserves himself, he is never carried away by Romains' theories. He ad- mires, differs, and occasionally formulates a corrective or corollary as in "Gloire."Mon esprit solitaire est une goutte d'huile Sur la pensee et sur le songe de la villaQui me laissent flotter et ne m'absorbent pas.75?76 INSTIGATIONSCompare this poem with Remains' "Ode to the Crowd Here Present" and you get the two angles of vision.Henry Spiess, a Genevan lawyer, has written an in- teresting series of sketches of the court-room. He is a more or less isolated figure. I have seen amusing and indecorous poems by George Fourest, but it is quite probable that they amuse because one is unfamiliar with their genre ; still "La Blonde Negresse" (the heroine of his title), his satire of the symbolo-rhapsodicoes in the series of poems about her: "La negresse blonde, la blonde negresse," gathering into its sound all the swish and woggle of the sound-over-sensists ; the poem on the beautiful blue-behinded baboon; that on the gentle- man "qui ne craignait ni la verole ni dieu"; "Les pianos du Casino au bord de la mer" (Laforgue plus the four- hour touch), are an egregious and diverting guffaw.(I do not think the book is available to the public. J. G. Fletcher once lent me a copy, but the edition was limited and the work seems rather unknown.)Romains is my chief concern. I can not give a full exposition of Unanimism on a page or two. Among all the younger writers and groups in Paris, the group cen- tering in Romains is the only one which seems to me to have an energy comparable to that of the Blast group in London,'" the only group in which the writers for Blast can be expected to take very much interest.Romains in the flesh does not seem so energetic as Lewis in the flesh, but then I have seen Romains only onceandIamwellacquaintedwithLewis. Romainsis, in his writing, more placid, the thought seems more passive, less impetuous.

As stated in my opening, that mediocre poetry is about the same in all countries ; that France has as much drivel, gas, mush, etc., poured into verse, as has any other nation.2. That it is impossible "to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear," or poetry out of nothing; that all attempts to "expand" a subject into poetry are futile, funda- mentally; that the subject matter must be coterminous with the expression. Tasso, Spenser, Ariosto, prose poems, diffuse forms of all sorts are all a preciosity; a parlor-game, and dilutations go to the scrap heap.3. That Corbiere, Rimbaud, Laforgue are permanent; that probably some of De Gourmont's and Tailhade's poems are permanent, or at least reasonably durable; that Romains is indispensable, for the present at any rate; thatpeoplewhosaythey"don'tlikeFrenchpoetry" are possibly matoids, and certainly ignorant of the scope and variety of French work. In the same way people are ignorant of the qualities of French people; ignorant that if they do not feel at home in Amiens (as I do not),thefe are other places in France; in the Charente if you walk across country you meet people exactly like the nicest people you can meet in the American country and they are not "foreign!'yi?78 INSTIGATIONSAll France is not to be found in Paris. The adjective "French" is current in America with a dozen erroneous or stupid connotations. If it means, as it did in the mouth of my contemporary, "talcum powder" and sur- face neatness, the selection of poems I have given here would almost show the need of, or at least a reason for, French Parnassienism ; for it shows the French poets violent, whether with the violent words of Corbiere, or the quiet violence of the irony of Laforgue, the sudden annihilations of his "turn-back" on the subject. Peopleforget that the incision of Voltaire is no more all of French Literature than is the robustezza of Brantome. (Burton of the "Anatomy" is our only writer who can match him.) They forget the two distinct finenesses of the Latin French and of the French "Gothic," that is of the eighteenth century, of Bernard (if one take a writer of no great importance to illustrate a definite quality), or of D'Orleans and of Froissart in verse. From this delicacy, if they can not be doing with it, they may turn easily to Villon or Basselin. Only a general distaste forliterature can be operative against all of these writers.UNANIMISMEThe English translation of Remains' "Mort de Quelqu'un" has provoked various English and American essays and reviews. His published works are "L'Ame des Hommes," 1904; "Le Bourg Regenere," 1906; "La Vie Unanime," 1908; "Premier Livre de Prieres," 1909; "La Foule qui est Ici," 1909 ; in 1910 and 191 1 "Un Etre en Marche," "Deux Poemes," "Manuel de Deification," "L'armee dans la Ville," "Puissances de Paris," and "Mort de Quelqu'un," employing the three excellent pub- lishing houses of the Mercure, Figuiere and Sansot.;:?A STUDY IN FRENCH POEtSHis "Reflexions" at the end of "Puissances de Paris" are so good a formulation of the Unanimiste Aesthetic, or "Pathetique," that quotation of them will do more to disabuse readers misled by stupid English criticism than would any amount of talk about Romains. I let him speak for himselfREFLEXIONS"Many people are .now ready to recognize that there are in the world beings more real than man. We admit the life of entities greater than our own bodies. Society is not merely an arithmetical total, or a collective desig- nation. We even credit the existence of groups inter- mediate between the individual and the state. But these opinions are put forth by abstract deduction or by ex- perimentation of reason."People employ them to complete a system of things and with the complacencies of analogy. If they do not follow a serious study of social data, they are at least the most meritorious results of observations ; they justify the method, and uphold the laws of a science which struggles manfully to be scientific."These fashions of knowing would seem both costly and tenuous. Man did not wait for physiology to give him a notion of his body, in which lack of patience he was intelligent, for physiology has given him but analytic and exterior information concerning things he had long known from within. He had been conscious of his organs long before he had specified their modes of ac- tivity. As spirals of smoke from village chimneys, the profound senses of each organ had mounted toward him joy, sorrow, all the emotions are deeds more fully of consciousness than are the thoughts of man's reason.79?8o INSTIGATIONSReason makes a concept of man, but the heart perceives the flesh of his body."In like manner we must know the groups that englobe us, not by observation from without, but by an organic consciousness. And it is by no means sure that the rhythms will make their nodes in us, if we be not the centresofgroups. Wehavebuttobecomesuch. Dig deep enough in our being, emptying it of individual rev- eries, dig enough little canals so that the souls of the groups will flow of necessity into us."I have attempted nothing else in this book. Various groups have come here into consciousness. They are still rudimentary, and their spirit is but a perfume in the air. Beings with as little consistence as la Rue du Havre, and la Place de la Bastile, ephemeral as the com- pany of people in an omnibus, or the audience at L'Opera Comique, can not have complex organism or thoughts greatly elaborate. People will think it superfluous that I should unravel such shreds in place of re-carding once more the enormous heap of the individual soul."Yet I think the groups are in the most agitated stage of their evolution. Future groups will perhaps deserve less affection, and we shall conceal the basis of things more effectively. Now the incomplete and unstable con- tours have not yet learned to stifle any tendency (aiiy inclination). Every impact sets them floating. They do not coat the infantile matter with a hard or impact- ingenvelope. Asuperiorplanthasrealizedbutfewof the possibilities swarming in fructificatory mould. A mushroom leads one more directly to the essential life quality than do the complexities of the oak tree."Thus the groups prepare more future than is strictly required. Thus we have the considerable happiness of watching the commencement of reign, the beginning of?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS 8ian organic series which will last as did others, for a thousand ages, before the cooling of the earth. This is not a progression, it is a creation, the first leap-out of a different series. Groups will not continue the activi- tiesofanimals,norofmen; theywillstartthingsafresh according to their own need, and as the consciousness of their substance increases they will refashion the image of the world."The men who henceforth can draw tlie souls of groups to converge within themselves, will give forth the com- ing dream, and will gather, to boot, certain intuitions of human habit. Our ideas of the being will undergo a correction; will hesitate rather more in finding a dis- tinction between the existent and non-existent. In pass- ing successively from the Place de I'Europe to the Place des Vosges, and then to a gang of navvies, one perceives that there are numerous shades of difference between nothingandsomething. Beforeresortingtogroupsone is sure of discerning a being of a simple idea. One knows that a dog exists, that he has an interior and independent unity ; one knows that a table or a mountain does not exist; nothing but our manner of speech cuts it off from the universal non-existing. But streets de- mand all shades of verbal expression (from the non- existing up to the autonomous creature)."One ceases to believe that a definite limit is the indis- pensable means of existence. Where does la Place de la Trinite begin ? The streets mingle their bodies. The squares isolate themselves with great difificulty. The crowd at the theatre takes on no contour until it has lived for some time, and with vigor. A being (etre) has a centre, or centres in harmony, but a being is not compelled to have limits. He exists a great deal in one place, rather less in others, and, further on, a second?82 INSTIGATIONSbeing commences before the first has left off. Every being has, somewhere in space, it^ maximum. Only ancestored individuals possess affirmative contours, a skin which cuts them off from the infinite."Spaceisnoone'spossession. Nobeinghassucceeded in appropriating one scrap of space and saturating it withhisownuniqueexistence. Everythingover-crosses, coincides, and cohabits. Every point is a perch for a thousand birds. Paris, the rue Montmartre, a crowd, a man, a protoplasm are on the same spot of pavement. A thousand existences are concentric. We see a little of some of them."How can we go on thinking that an individual is a solitary thing which is born, grows, reproduces itself and dies? This is a superior and inveterate manner of being an individual. But groups are not truly born. Their life makes and unmakes itself like an unstable state of matter, a condensation which does not endure. They show us that life, at its origin, is a provisory atti- tude, a moment of exception, an intensity between two relaxations, not continuity, nothing decisive. The first entireties take life by a sort of slow success, and extin- guish themselves without catastrophe, the single elements do not perish because the whole is disrupted."The crowd before the Baraque Foraine starts to live little by little, as water in a kettle begins to sing and evaporate. The passages of the Odeon do not live by night,eachdaytheyarereal,afewhours. Atthestart life seems the affair of a moment, then it becomes inter- mittent. To be durable; to become a development and a destiny; to be defined and finished off at each end by birth and death, it needs a deal of accustomedness."The primitive forms are not coequal. There is a natural hierarchy among groups. Streets have no set?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS 83middle, no veritable limitations; they hold a long vacil- lating sort of life which night flattens out almost to nothingness. Cross-roadsandsquarestakeoncontour, andgatherupthenodesoftheirrhythms. Othergroups have a fashioned body, they endure but a little space, buttheyhavelearned,almost,todie; theyevenresurrect themselves as by a jerk or dry spasm, they begin the habit of being, they strive toward it, and this puts them out of breath."I have not yet met a group fully divine. None has had a real consciousness, none has addressed me, saying: I exist. The day when the first group shall take its soul in its hands, as one lifts up a child in order to look in its face, that day there will be a new god upon earth. This is the god I await, with my labor of annunciation."This excerpt from Romains gives the tone of his thought. In so far as he writes in the present tense he carries conviction. He broaches truly a "new," or at leastcontemporary"pathetique." Heutters,inoriginal vein, phases of consciousness whereinto we are more or less drifting, in measure of our proper sensibility.I retain, however, my full suspicion of agglomerates.DE BOSSCHERE'S STUDY OF ELSKAMP *I CONFESSED in my February essay my inability to make anything of Max Elskamp's poetry, and I have tacitly confessed my inability to find any formula for hawking De Bosschere's own verge to any public of myacquaintance; De Bosschere's study of Elskamp, how- ever, requires no advocacy; I do not think it even re-* "Max Elskamp"; essai par lean De Bosscfi^re. Bibliothique de I'Occident, 17 rue Ehli, Paris, fr. 3.50.?84 INSTIGATIONSquires to be a study of Max Elskamp ; it drifts as quiet canal water; the protagonist may or not be a real man."Ici, la solitude est plus accentuee: souvent, pendant de longues minutes, les rues sont desertes. . . . Les portes ne semblent pas, ainsi que dans les grandes villes, s'ouvrir sur un poumon de vie, et etre une cellule vivante de la rue. Au contraire, toutes sont fetmees. Aussi bien, les facades de ce quartier sont pareilles aux murs borgnes. Unmincerubandecielrouxetgris,apeine' bleu au printemps, decoupe les pignons, se tend sur le marche desert et sur le puits profond des cours."From this Antwerp, De Bosschere derives his subject, as Gautier his "Albertus" fromUn vieux bourg flamand tel que peint Teniers; trfces bathing in water."Son univers etait limite par : 'le grand peuplier' ; une statue de Pomone, 'le grand rocher,' et 'la grand grenouille' ; ceci etait un coin touffu ovi il y avait de I'eau et oil il ne vit jamais qu'une seule grenouille, qu'il croyait immortelle." DeBosschere'snextvisionofElskampis when his subject is pointed out as "le poete decadent," for no apparent reason save that he read Mallarme at a time when Antwerp did not. The study breaks into a cheerful grin when Elskamp tells of Mallarme's one appearance in the sea-port:"Le bruit et les cris qui furent pousses pendant la conference de Mallarme, I'arreterent plusieurs fois. L'opinion du public sur sa causerie est contenue en ces quelques mots, dits par un general retraite, grand joueur de billard, et qui du reste ne fit qu'une courte absence de la salle de jeu, pour ecouter quelques phrases du poete. 'Get homme est ivre ou fou,' dit il fort haut, en quittant la salle, ou son jugement fit loi. Anvers, malgre un leger masque de snobisme, qui pourrait"?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS 85tromper, n'a pas change depuis. Mallarme, meme pour les avertis, est toujours rhomme ivre ou fou."The billiard player is the one modern touch in the book; for the rest Elskamp sails with sea-captains, ap- parently in sailing ships to Constantinople, or perhaps one should call it Byzantium. He reads Juan de la Cruz and Young's Night Thoughts, and volumes of de- monology, in the properly dim library of his maternal grandfather, "Sa passion en rhetorique fut pour Long- fellow, il traduisait 'Song of (sic) Hiawatots.'The further one penetrates into De Bosschere's de- lightful narrative the less real is the hero; the less he needs to be real. A phantom has been called out of De Foe's period, delightful phantom, taking on the reality of the fictitious; in the end the author has created a charming figure, but I am as far as ever from making head or tail of the verses attributed to this creation. I have had a few hours' delightful reading, I have loitered along slow canals, behind a small window sits Elskamp doing something I do not in the least understand.IISo was I at the end of the first division "Sur la Vie" de Max Elskamp. The second division, concerned with "Oeuvre et Vie," but raised again the questions that had faced me in reading Elskamp's printed work. He has an undercurrent, an element everywhere present, differentiating his poems from other men's poems. De Bosschere scarcely helps me to name it. The third divi- sion of the book, at first reading, nearly quenched the curiosity and the interest aroused by the first two-thirds. On second reading I thought better of it. Elskamp, plunged in the middle ages, in what seems almost an;?86 INSTIGATIONSatrophy, as much as an atavism, becomes a little more plausible. (For what it is worth, I read the chapter upon a day of almost complete exhaustion.)"Or, quand la vision lache comme une proie videe le saint, il demeure avec les hommes.""Entre le voyant et ceux qui le sanctifient il y a un precipice insondatle. Seul I'individu est beatific par sa croyance; mais il ne pent I'utiliser au temporel ni la partager avec les hommes, et c'est peut-etre la forme unique de la justice sur terre."The two sentences give us perhaps the tone of De Boss- chere's critique "Sur le Mysticisme" of Elskamp.It is, however, not in De Bosschere, but in La Wallome that I found the clue to this author:CONSOLATRICE DES AFFLIGESEt I'hiver m'a donne la main,J'ai la main d'Hiver dans les mains,et dans ma tete, au loin, il bruleles vieux etes de canicule ;et dans mes yeux, en candeurs lentes, tres blanchement il fait des tentes,dans mes yeux il fait des Sicile, puis des lies, encore des iles.Et c'est tout un voyage en rond trop vite pour la guerisona tons les pays oti Ton meurtau long cours des mers et des heures?A STUDY IN FRENCH POETS 87et c'est tout un voyage au vent sur les vaisseaux de mes lits blancsqui houlent avec des etoilcsa I'entour de toutes les voiles.or j'ai le gout de mer aux levres comme une rancoeur de genievrebu pour la tres mauvaise orgie des departs dans les tabagies;puis ce pays encore me vient: un pays de neiges sans fin. . . .Marie des bonnes couvertures, faites-y la neige moins dureet courir moins comme des lieresmes mains sur mes draps blancs de fievre.--Max Elskamp in "La Wallonie," 1892.The poem appears in Van Bever and Leautaud's an- thology and there rhay be no reason for my not having thence received it; but there is, for all that, a certain value in finding a man among his native surroundings, and in finding Elskamp at home, among his contem- poraries, I gained first the advantage of comprehension.ALBERT MOCKEL AND "LA WALLONIE" *I recently received a letter from Albert Mockel, written with a graciousness not often employed by Eng- lish and American writers in communication to their* Utile Review, Oct., 1918.?88 INSTIGATIONSjuniors. Indeed, the present elder generation of Ameri- can "respectable" authors having all their lives ap- proached so nearly to death, have always been rather annoyed that American letters did not die utterly in their personal desiccations. Signs of vitality; signs of inter- est in, or cognizance of other sections of this troubled planet have been steadily and papier-macheedly depre- cated. The rubbish bins of Harper's and the Century have opened their lids not to new movements but only to the diluted imitations of new movers, etc.La Wallonie, beginning as L'Elan Litteraire in 1885, endured seven years. It announced for a full year on its covers that its seventh year was its last. Albert Meckel has been gracious enough to call it "Notre Little Review a nous," and to commend the motto on our cover, in the letter here following:109, Avenue de Paris 8 mai, 1918 La MaJmaison RuejlMonsieur et cher confrere,Merci de votre amiable envoi.

Croyez-moi sympathiquement votre,Albert Mockel.With a native mistrust of la belle phrase; of "temps dorel' "ferveur," "belle confiance," etc., and with an equally native superiority to any publication not printed LARGE, I opened La Wallonie. The gropings, "ta- tonnements," to which M. Mockel so modestly refers, appear to have included some of the best work of Mallarme, of Stuart Merrill, of Max Elskamp and Emile Verhaeren. Verlaine contributed to La Wallonie, De Regnier was one of its editors . . . Men of since popu-lar fame--Bourget, Pierre Louys, Maeterlinck--ap- peared with the rarer spirits.If ever the "amateur magazine" in the sense of maga- zine by lovers of art and letters, for lovers of art and letters, in contempt of the commerce of letters, has vin- dicated itself, that vindication was La Wallonie. Ver- haeren's "Les Pauvres" first appeared there as the sec-:?90 INSTIGATIONSoncl part of the series : "Chansons des Carrefours" (Jan., '92) . . .

Permanent literature, and the seeds of permanent litera- ture, had gone through proof-sheets in their office.There is perhaps no greater pleasure in life, and there certainly can have been no greater enthusiasm than to have been young and to have been part of such a group of writers working in fellowship at the beginning of such a course, of such a series of courses as were impli- cated in La Wallonie.If the date is insufficiently indicated by Mallarme's allusion to Whistler, we may turn to the art notes"eaux-fortes de Mile Mary Cassatt . . .

Mockel.?IIHENRY JAMESThis essay on James is a dull grind of an affair, a Baedecker to a continent.I set out to explain, not why Henry James is less read than formerly--I do not know that he is. I tried to set down a few reasons why he ought to be, or at least might be, more read.Some may say that his work was over, well over, finely completed; there is mass of that work, heavy for one man's shoulders to have borne up, labor enough for two life-times; still we would have had a few more years of his writing. Perhaps the grasp was relaxing, per- haps we should have had no strongly-planned book; but we should have had paragraphs here and there, and we should have had, at least, conversation, wonderful con- versation ; even if we did not hear it ourselves, we should have known that it was going on somewhere. The mas- sive head, the slow uplift of the hand, gli occhi onesti e tardi, the long sentences piling themselves up in elab- orate phrase after phrase, the lightning incision, the pauses, the slightly shaking admonitory gesture with its;""wu-a-wait a little, wait a little, something will come blague and benignity and the weight of so many years' careful, incessant labor of minute observation alwaysio6?HENRY JAMES 107there to enrich the talk. I had heard it but seldom, yet it was all unforgettable.The man had this curious power of fouoding-affection in those who had scarcely seen him and even in many who had not, who but knew him at second hand.No man who has not lived on both sides of the Atlan- tic can well appraise Henry James ; his death marks the end of a period. The Times says : "The Americans will understand his changing his nationality," or some- thing of that sort. The "Americans" will understand nothing whatsoever about it. They have understood nothing about it. They do not even know what they lost. They have not stopped for eight minutes to con- sider the meaning of his last public act. After a year of ceaseless labor, of letter writing, of argument, of striving in every way to bring in America on the side of civilization, he died of apoplexy. On the side of civilization--civilization against barbarism, civilization, not Utopia, not a country or countries where the right always prevails in six v^eeks! After a life-time spent in trying to make two continents understand each other, in trying, and only his thoughtful readers can have any conception of how he had tried, to make three '^fetions intelligible one to another. I am tired of hearing petti- ness talked about Henry James's style. The subject has been discussed enough in all conscience, along with the minor James. Yet I have heard no word of the major James, of the hater of tyranny; book after early book against oppression, against all the sordid petty personal crushing oppression, the domination of modern life; not worked out in the diagrams of Greek tragedy, hot labeled "epos" or "Aeschylus." The outbursts in The Tragic Muse, the whole of The Turn of the Screw,?io8 INSTIGATIONShuman liberty, personal liberty, the rights of the indi- vidual against all sorts of intangible bondage! * The passion of it, the continual passion of it in this man who, fools said, didn't "feel." I have never yet found a man of emotion against whom idiots didn't raise this cry.And the great labor, this labor of translation, of mak- ing America intelligible, of making it possible for indi- viduals to meet across national borders. I think half the American idiom is recorded in Henry James's writ- ing, and whole decades of American life that otherwise would have been utterly lost, wasted, rotting in the un- hermeticjarsofbadwriting,ofinaccuratewriting. No English reader will ever know how good are his New York and his New England; no one who does not see his grandmother's friends in the pages of the American books. Thewholegreatassayingandweighing,there- search for the significance of nationality, French, Eng- lish, American."An extraordinary old woman, one of the few people who is really doing anything good." There were the cobwebs about connoisseurship, etc., but what do they matter ? Some yokel writes in the village paf>er, as Hen- ley had written before, "James's stuff was not worth doing." Henley has gone pretty completely. America has not yet realized that never in history had one of her* This holds, despite anything that may be said of his fuss about social order, social tone. I naturally do not drag in po- litical connotations, from which H. J. was, we believe, wholly exempt. What he fights is "influence", the impinging of family pressure, the impinging of one personality on another; all of them in highest degree damn'd, loathsome and detestable. Re- spect for the peripheries of the individual may be, however, a discovery of our generation; I doubt it, but it seems to have been at low ebb in some districts (not rural) for some time.:?HENRY JAMES lopgreat men abandoned his citizenship out of shame. It was the last act--the last thing left. He had worked all his life for the nation and for a year he had labored forthenationalhonor. NootherAmericanwasofsuffi- cient importance for his change of allegiance to have constituted an international act; no other American would have been welcome in the same public manner. America passes over these things, but the thoughtful cannot pass over them.Armageddon, the conflict? I turn to James's A Bundle of Letters; a letter from "Dr. Rudolph Staub" in Paris, ending"You will, I think, hold me warranted in believing that between precipitate decay and internecine enmities, the English-speaking family is destined to consume it- self and that with its decline the prospect of general pervasiveness to which I alluded above, will brighten!" for the deep-lunged children of the fatherlandWe have heard a great deal of this sort of thing since ; it sounds very natural. My edition of the volume containing these letters was printed in '83, and the imag- inary letters were written somewhat before that. I do not know that this calls for comment. Henry James's perception came thirty years before Armageddon. That is all I wish to point out. Flaubert said of the War of1870: "If they had read my Education Sentimentaie, this sort of thing wouldn't have happened." Artists are the antennse of the race, but the bullet-headed many will never learn to trust their great artists. If it is the busi- ness of the artist to make humanity aware of itself; here the thing was done, the pages of diagnosis. The multitude of wearisome fools will not learn their right hand from their left or seek out a meaning.?no INSTIGATIONSIt is always easy for people to object to what they have not tried to understand.I am not here to write a full volume of detailed criti- cism, but two things I do claim which I have not seen in reviewers'essays. First,thattherewasemotionalgreat- ness in Henry Jarnes's hatred of tyranny ; secondly, that there was titanic volume, weight, in the masses he sets in opposition within his work. He uses forces no whit less specifically powerful than the proverbial "doom of the house,"--Destiny, Deus ex machina,--of great tra- ditional art. His art was great art as opposed to over- elaborate or over-refined art by virtue of the major conflictswhichheportrays. Inhisbooksheshowedrace against race, immutable ; the essential Americanness, or Englishness or Frenchness--in The American, the dif- ferencebetweenonenationandanother; notflag-waving and treaties, not the machinery of government, but "why" there is always misunderstanding, why men of different race are not the same.We have ceased to believe that we conquer an)rthing by having Alexander the Great make a gigantic "joy- ride"throughIndia. Weknowthatconquestsaremade in the laboratory, that Curie with his minute fragments of things seen clearly in test tubes in curious apparatus, makes conquests. So, too, in these novels, the essential qualities which make up the national qualities, are found and set working, the fundamental oppositions ttiade clear. This is no contemptible labor. No other writer had so essayed three great nations or even thought of attempt- ing it.Peacecomesofcommunication. Nomanofourtime has so labored to create means of communication as did the late Henry James. The whole of great art is a strug-?HENRY JAMES iiigle for communication. All things that oppose this are evil, whether they be silly scoffing or obstructive tariffs.And this communication is not a leveling, it is not an elimination of differences. It is a recognition of differ- ences, of the right of differences to exist, of interest in finding things different. Kultur is an abomination phi-;lology is an abomination, all repressive uniforming edu- cation is an evil.A SHAKE DOWNI have forgotten the moment of lunar imbecility in which I 'conceived the idea of a "Henry James" num- ber.* Thepileoftypescriptonmyfloorcanbutannoy- ingly and too palpably testify that the madness has raged for some weeks.Henry James was aware of the spherical form of the planet, and susceptible to a given situation, and to the tone and tonality of persons as perhaps no other author in all literature. The victim and the votary of the "scene," he had no very great narrative sense, or at the least, he attained the narrative faculty but per aspera, through very great striving.It is impossible to speak accurately of "his style," for he passed through several styles which differ greatly one from another; but in his last, his most complicated and elaborate, he is capable of great concision; and if, in it, the single sentence is apt to turn and perform evolutions for almost pages at a time, he nevertheless manages to say on one page more than many a more "direct" author would convey only in the course of a chapter.*Little Review, Aug., 1918.?112 INSTIGATIONSHis plots and incidents are often btit adumbrations or symbols of the quality of his "people," illustrations invented, contrived, often factitiously and almost trans- parently, to show what acts, what situations, what con-tingencieswouldbefitordisplaycertaincharacters. We are hardly asked to accept them as happening.He did not begin his career with any theory of art for art's sake, and a lack of this theory may have dam- aged his earlier work.If we take "French Poets and Novelists" as indication of his then (1878) opinions, and novels of the nineties showing a later bias, we might contend that our sub- ject began his career with a desire to square all things to the ethical standards of a Salem mid-week Unitarian prayer meeting, and that to almost the end of his course he greatly desired to fit the world into the social exigen- cies of Mrs. Humphry Ward's characters.Out of the unfortunate cobwebs he emerged into his greatness, I think, by two causes : first by reason of his hatred of personal intimate tyrannies working at close range ; and secondly, in later life, because the actual mechanism of his scriptorial processes became so bulky, became so huge a contrivance for record and depiction, that the old man simply couldn't remember or keep his mind on or animadvert on anything but the attthenticity of his impression.I take it as the supreme reward for an artist; the supreme return that his artistic conscience can make him after years spent in its service, that the momentum of his art, the sheer bulk of his processes, the (si licet) size of his fly-wheel, should heave him out of himself, out of his personal limitations, out of the tangles of heredity and of environment, out of the bias of early training, of early predilections, whether of Florence,?HENRY JAMES 113A. D. 1300, or of Back Bay of 1872, and leave him simply the great true recorder.And this reward came to Henry James in the ripeness of his talents; even further perhaps it entered his life and his conversation. The stages of his emergence are marked quite clearly in his work. He displays himself in French Poets and Novelists, constantly balancing over the question of whether or no the characters presented in their works are, or are not, fit persons to be received in the James family back-parlor.In The Tragic Muse he is still didactic quite openly. The things he believes still leap out nakedly among the people and things he is portraying; the parable is not yet wholly incarnate in the narrative.To lay all his faults on the table, we may begin with his self-confessed limitation, that "he never went down town," He displayed in fact a passion for high life comparable only to that supposed to inhere in the read- ers of a magazine called Forget-me-not.Hardy, with his eye on the Greek tragedians, has pro- duced an epic tonality, and The Mayor of Casterbridge is perhaps more easily comparable to the Grettir Saga than to the novels of Mr. Hardy's contemporaries. Hardy is, on his other side, a contemporary of Sir Wal- ter Scott.Balzac gains what force his crude writing permits him by representing his people under the avayKti of modernity, cash necessity James, by leaving cash neces-;sity nearly always out of the story, sacrifices, or rather fails to attain, certain intensities.He never manages the classic, I mean as Flaubert gives us in each main character: Everyman. One may con- ceivably be bored by certain pages in Flaubert, but one takes from him a solid and concrete memory, a prop-?114 INSTIGATIONSerty. Emma Bovary and Frederic and M. Arnoux are respectively every woman and every man of their period. Maupassant's Bel Ami is not. Neither are Henry James'speople. Theyarealways,ornearlyalways,the bibelots.But he does, nevertheless, treat of major forces, even of epic forces, and in a way all his own. If Balzac tried to give a whole civilization, a whole humanity, James was not content with a rough sketch of one country.As Armageddon has only too clearly shown, national qualities are the great gods of the present and Henry James spent himself from the beginning in an analysis of these potent chemicals ; trying to determine from the given microscopic slide the nature of the Frenchness, Englishness, Germanness, Americanness, which chemi- cals too little regarded, have in our time exploded for want of watching. They are the permanent and fun- damental hostilities and incbmpatibles. We may rest our claim for his greatness in the magnitude of his pro- tagonists, in the magnitude of the forces he analyzed andportrayed. Thisisnotthebarematterofanumber of titled people, a few duchesses and a few butlers.Whatever Flaubert may have said about his Educa- tion Sentimentale as a potential preventive of the debacle of 1870, if people had read itj and whatever Gautier's friend may have said about Emaux et Camees as the last resistance to the Prussians, from Dr. Rudolph Staub's paragraph in The Bundle of Letters to the last and al- most only public act of his life, James displayed a steady perception and a steady consideration of the qualities of different western races, whose consequences none of us can escape.And these forces, in precisely that they are not polit- ical and executive and therefore transient, factitious,?HENRY JAMES 115but in precisely that they are the forces of race temper- aments, are major forces and are indeed as great pro- tagonists as any author could have chosen. They are firmer ground than Flaubert's when he chooses public events as in the opening of the third part of Education Sentimentale.The portrayal of these forces, to seize a term from philology, may be said to constitute "original research'' --^to be Henry James's own addendum; not that this greatlymatters. Hesaw,analyzed,andpresentedthem. He had most assuredly a greater awareness than was granted to Balzac or to Mr. Charles Dickens or to M. Victor Hugo who composed the Legende des Siecles.His statement that he never went down town has been urged greatly against him. A butler is a servant, tem- pered with upper-class contacts. Mr. Newman, the American, has emerged from the making of wash-tubs; the family in The Pupil can scarcely be termed upper- class, however, and the factor of money, Balzac's, avayKTi, scarcely enters his stories.WemayleaveHardywritingSagas. Wemayadmit that there is a greater rohustezza in Balzac's messiness, simply because he is perpetually concerned, inaccurately, with the factor of money, of earning one's exiguous living.We may admit the shadowy nature of some of James's writing, and agree whimsically with R. H. C. (in the New Age) that James will be quite comfortable after death, as he had been dealing with ghosts all his life.James's third donation is perhaps a less sweeping affair and of more concern to his compatriots than to any one who might conceivably translate him into an alien tongue, or even to those who publish his writings in England.?ii6 INSTIGATIONSHe has written history of a personal sort, social his- tory well documented and incomplete, and he has put America on the map both in memoir and fiction, giving to her a reality such as is attained only by scenes re- corded in the arts and in the writing of masters. Mr. Eliot has written, and I daresay most other American admirers have written or will write, that, whatever any one else thinks of Henry James, no one but an American can ever know, really know, how good he is at the bot- tom, how good his "America" is.No Englishman can, and in less degree can any con- tinental, or in fact any one whose family was not living on, say. West 23rd Street in the old set-back, two-story- porched red brick vine-covered houses, etc., when Henry James was being a small boy on East 23rd Street; no one whose ancestors had not been presidents or profes- sors or founders of Ha'avwd College or something of that sort, or had not heard of a time when people lived on 14th Street, or had known of some one living in Lexington or Newton "Old Place" or somewhere of that sort in New England, or had heard of the New York that produced "Fanny," New York the jocular and un- critical, or of people who danced with General Grant or something of that sort, would quite know Washing-ton Square or The Europeans to be so autochthonous, so authentic to the conditions. They might believe the things to be "real," but they would not know how closely they corresponded to an external reality.Perhaps only an exile from these things will get the range of the other half of James's presentations!

He was not without sympathy for his compatriots as is amply attested by Mr. and Mrs. B. D. Hayes of New York (vide The Birthplace) with whom he succeeds, I think, rather better than with most of his princely con- tinentals. They are, at any rate, his bow to the HappyGenius of his country--as distinct from the gentleman who displayed the "back of a banker and a patriot," or the person whose aggregate features could be designated only as a "mug."In his presentation of America he is greatly atten- tive, and, save for the people in Coeur Simple, I doubt if any writer has done more of "this sort of tning" for his country, this portrayal of the typical thing in timbre and quality--balanced, of course, by the array of spit- toons in the Capitol ("The Point of View").Still if one is seeking a Spiritual Fatherland, if one feels the exposure of what he would not have scrupled to call, two clauses later, such a wind-shield, "The American Scene" greatly provides it. It has a mermaid note, almost to outvie the warning, the sort of nickel- plate warning which is hurled at one in the saloon of any great transatlantic boat; the awfulness that engulfs one when one comes, for the first time unexpectedly on a pile of all the Mtvrkhn Magazines laid, shingle-wise on a brass-studded, screwed-into-place, baize-covered steamer table. The first glitter of the national weapons for driving off quiet and all closer signs of intelligence.** I differ, beyond that point, with our author. I enjoy ascent as much as I loathe descent in an elevator. I do not mind the?ii8 INSTIGATIONSAttempting to view the jungle of the work as a whole, one notes that, despite whatever cosmopolitan upbringing Henry James may have had, as witness "A Small Boy's Memoirs" and "Notes of Son and Brother," he neverthe- less began in "French Poets and Novelists" with a pro- vincial attitude that it took him a long time to work free of. Secondly we see various phases of the "style" of his presentation or circumambiance.There is a small amount of prentice work. Let us say "Roderick Hudson," "Casamassima." There are lucky first steps in "The American" and "Europeans," a pre- cocity of result, for certainly some of his early work is as permanent as some of the ripest, and more so than adealoftheintervening. Wefind(forinthecasebe- fore us criticism must be in large part a weeding-out) that his first subject matter provides him with a number of good books and stories : "The American," "The Euro- peans," "Eugene Pickering," "Daisy Miller," "The Pu-pil," "Brooksmith," "A Bundle of Letters," "Washing- ton Square," "The Portrait of a Lady," before 1880, and rather later, "Pandora," "The Four Meetings," perhaps "Louisa Pallant." He ran out of his first material.We next note a contact with the "Yellow Book," a dip into "cleverness," into the epigrammatic genre, the bare epigrammatic style. It was no better than other writers, not so successful as Wilde. We observe him to be not so hard and fine a satirist as is George S. Street.We come then to the period of allegories ("The Real Thing,""DominickFerrand,""TheLiar"). Thereen-click of brass doors. I had indeed for. my earliest toy, if I was not brought up in it, the rather slow and well-behaved elevator in a quiet and quietly bright huge sanatorium. The height of high buildings, the chasms of New York are delecta- ble; but this is beside the point; one is not asked to share the views and tastes of a writer.?HENRY JAMES 119sues a growing discontent with the short sentence, epi- gram, etc., in which he does not at this time attain dis- tinction; the clarity is not satisfactory, was not satisfac- tory to the author, his donne being radically different from that of his contemporaries. The "story" not be- ing really what he is after, he starts to build up his me- dium; a thickening, a chiaroscuro is needed, the long sentence; he wanders, seeks to add a needed opacity, he overdoes it, produces the cobwebby novel, emerges or justifies himself in "Maisie" and manages his long- sought form in "The Awkward Age." He comes out the triumphant stylist in the "American Scene" and in all the items of "The Finer Grain" collection and in the posthumous "Middle Years."This is not to damn incontinent all that intervenes, but I think the chief question addressed to me by people of good-will who do not, but are yet ready and willing to, read James, is : Where the deuce shall I begin ? One cannot take even the twenty-four volumes, more or less selected volumes of the Macmillan edition all at once, and it is, alas, but too easy to get so started and entoiled as never to finish this author or even come to the best of him.The laziness of an uncritical period can be nowhere more blatant than in the inherited habit of talking about authors as a whole. It is perhaps the sediment from an age daft over great figures or a way of displaying social gush, the desire for a celebrity at all costs, rather than a care of letters.To talk in any other way demands an acquaintance with the work of an author, a price few conversation- alists care to pay, ma che!- It is the man with inherited opinions who talks about "Shelley," making no distinc- tion between the author of the Fifth Act of "The Cenci"--?I20 INSTIGATIONSandofthe"SensitivePlant." Notbutwhattheremay be a personal virtu in an author--appraised, however, from the best of his work when, that is, it is correctly appraised. PeopleaskmewhatJamestoread. Heisa very uneven author; not all of his collected edition has marks of permanence.One can but make one's own suggestion:"The American," "French Poets and NoveHsts," "The Europeans," "Daisy Miller," "Eugene Pickering," "Washington Square," "A Bundle of Letters," "Portrait of a Lady," "Pandora," "The Pupil," "Brooksmith," "What Maisie Knew," and "The Awkward Age" (if one is "doing it all"), "Europe," "Four Meetings," "The Ambassadors," "The American Scene," "The Finer Grain" (all the volume, i.e., "The Velvet Glove," "Mona Montravers," "Round of Visits," "Crapey Cornelia," "Bench of Desolation"), "The Middle Years" (post- humous) and "The Ivory Tower" (notes first).I "go easy" on the more cobwebby volumes; the most Jamesian are indubitably "The Wings of a Dove" and "The Golden Bowl"; upon them devotees will fasten, but the potential devotee may as well find his aptitude in the stories of "The Finer Grain" volume where cer- tain exquisite titillations will come to him as readily as anywhere else. If he is to bask in Jamesian tickle, noth- ing will restrain him and no other author will to any such extent afford him equal gratifications.If, however, the reader does not find delectation in the list given above, I think it fairly useless for him to embark on the rest.Part of James is a caviare, part I must reject accord- ing to my lights as bad writing; another part is a spe- cialite, a pleasure for certain temperaments only; the part I have set together above seems to me maintain-;?HENRY JAMES 121able as literature. One can definitely say : "this is good" hold the argumentative field, suffer comparison with other writers; with, say, the De Goncourt, or De Mau- passant. Iamnotimpertinentlythrowingbooksonthe scrap-heap; there are certain valid objections to James; there are certain standards which one may believe in, and having stated them, one is free to state that any author does not comply with them; granting always that there may be other standards with which he complies, or over which he charmingly or brilliantly triumphs.James does not."feel" as solid as Flaubert; he does not give us "Everyman," but on the other hand, he was aware of things which Flaubert was not aware of, and in certain things supersedes the author of "Madame Bovary."He appears at times to write around and around a thing and not always to emerge from the "amorous plan" of what he wanted to present, into definite presentation.He does not seem to me at all times evenly skillful in catching the intonations of speech. He recalls the New England "a" in the "Lady's" small brothers "Ha-ard" (Haahr-d) but only if one is familiar with the phonetics, described; but (vide the beginning of "The Birthplace") one is not convinced that he really knows (by any sure instinct) how people's voices would sound. Some re- marks are in key, some obviously factitious.He gives us more of his characters by description than he can by any attribution of conversation, save perhaps by the isolated and discreet remarks of Brook- smith.His emotional centre is in being sensitive to the feci of the place or to the tonality of the person.It is with his own so beautiful talk, his ability to hear his own voice in the rounded paragraph, that he is aptest?122 INSTIGATIONSto charm one. I find it often though not universally hard to "hear" his characters spearking. I have noted various places where the character notably stops speak-ing and the author interpolates words of his own; sen- tences that no one but Henry James could in any cir- cumstances have made use of. Beyond which state- ments I see no great concision or any clarity to be gained by rearranging my perhaps too elliptical comments on individual books.Honest criticism, as I conceive it, cannot get much further than saying to one's reader exactly what one would say to the friend who approaches one's bookshelf asking: "What the deuce shall I read?" Beyond this there is the "parlor game," the polite essay, and thereis the official pronouncement, with neither of which we are concerned.Of all exquisite writers James is the most colloquial, yet in the first edition of his "French Poets and Novel- ists," his style, save for a few scattered phrases, is so little unusual that most of the book seems, superficially, as if it might have been written by almost any one. It contahis some surprising lapses ... as bad as any in Mr. Hueffer or even in Mr. Mencken. It is interesting largely in that it shows us what our subject had to escape from.Let us grant at once that his novels show him, all through his life, possessed of the worst possible taste in pictures, of an almost unpunctured ignorance of painting, of almost as great a lack of taste as that which he attributes to the hack-work and newspaper critiques ofTheophileGautier. Letusadmitthat"painting"to Henry James probably meant, to the end of his life, theworst possible late Renaissance conglomerations.Let us admit that in 1876, or whenever it was, his?HENRY JAMES 123taste in poetry inclined to the swish of De Musset, that it very likely never got any further. By "poetry" he very possibly meant the "high-falutin" and he eschewed it in certain forms; himself taking still higher falutes in a to-be-developed mode of his own.I doubt if he ever wholly outgrew that conception of the (by him so often invoked) Daughters of Memory. He arrived truly at a point from which he could look back upon people who "besought the deep blue sea to roll." Poetry to him began, perhaps, fuUfledged, spring- ing Minerva-like from the forehead of George Gordon, Lord Byron, and went pretty much to the bad in Charles Baudelaire; it did not require much divination by 1914("The Middle Years") to note that he had found Tenny- son rather vacuous and that there "was something in" Browning.James was so thoroughly a recorder of people, of their atmospheres, society, personality, setting; so wholly the artist of this particular genre, that it was impossible for him ever to hold a critical opinion of art out of key with the opinion about him--except possibly in so far as he might have ambitions for the novel, for his own partic- ular metier. His critical opinions were simply an ex- tension of his being in key with the nice people who "impressed" themselves on his gelatine "plate." (This is a theoretical generalization and must be taken cum grano.)We may, perhaps, take his adjectives on De Musset as a desperate attempt to do "justice" to a man with whom he knew it impossible for him to sympathize. There is, however, nothing to hinder our supposing that he saw in De Musset's "gush" something for him impossible and that he wished to acknowledge it. Side by side--?124 INSTIGATIONSwith this are the shreds of Back Bay or Buffalo, the mid-week-prayer-meeting point of view.His most egregious sHp is in the essay on Baudelaire, thesentencequotedbyHueffer.* Notwithstandingthis, he does effectively put his nippers on Baudelaire's weak- ness :"A good way to embrace Baudelaire at a glance is to say that he was, in his treatment of evil, exactly what Hawthorne was not--Hawthorne, who felt the thing at its source, deep in the human consciousness. Baude- laire's infinitely slighter volume of genius apart, he was a sort of Hawthorne reversed. It is the absence ofthis metaphysical quality in his treatment of his favorite subjects (Poe was his metaphysician, and his devotion sustained him through a translation of 'Eureka!') that exposes him to that class of accusations of which M. Edmond Scherer's accusation of feeding upon pourriture is an example; and, in fact, in his pages we never know withwhatwearedealing. Weencounteraninextricable confusion of sad emotions and vile things, and we are at a loss to know whether the subject pretends to appeal to our conscience or--we were going to say--to our olfac- tories. 'Le Mai ?' we exclaim ; 'you do yourself too much honor. This is not Evil ; it is not the wrong ; it is simply thenasty!' Ourimpatienceisofthesameorderasthat which we should feel if a poet, pretending to pluck 'the flowers of good,' should come and present us, as speci- mens, a rhapsody on plum-cake and eatt de Cologne."Here as elsewhere his perception, apart from the read- ability of the work, is worthy of notice.* "For a poet to be realist is of course nonsense", and, as Hueffer says, such a sentence from such a source is enough to make one despair of human nature.--?HENRY JAMES 125Hueffer says * that James befauds Balzac. I cannot see it. I can but perceive Henry James wiping the floor with the author of "Eugenie Grandet," pointing out all his qualities, but almightily wiping the floor with him. He complains that Gautier is lacking in a concern about supernatural hocus-pocus and that Flaubert is lacking. If Balzac takes him to any great extent in, James with his inherited Swedenborgianism is perhaps thereby laid open to Balzac.It was natural that James should write more about the bulky author of "La Comedie Humaine" than about the others; here was his richest quarry, here was there most to note and to emend and to apply so emended to processes of his own. From De Maupassant, De Gon- court or Baudelaire there was nothing for him to ac- quire.His dam'd fuss about furniture is foreshadowed in Balzac, and all the paragraphs on Balzac's house-fur- nishing propensities are of interest in proportion to our interest in, or our^ boredom with, this part of Henry James's work.What, indeed, could he have written of the De Gon- courts save that they were a little dull but tremendously right in their aim? Indeed, but for these almost auto- biographical details pointing to his growth out of Balzac, all James would seem but a corollary to one passage in a De Goncourt preface:"Le jour ou I'analyse cruelle que mon ami, M. Zola, et peutetre moi-meme avons apportee dans la peinture du bas de la societe sera reprise par un ecrivain de talent, et employee a la reproduction des hommes et des femmes du monde, dans les milieux d' education et de distinction* Ford Madox Hueflfer's volume on Henry James.?126 INSTIGATIONS--ce jour-la seulement le classicisme et sa queue seront tues. . . ."Le Realisme n'a pas en eflfet I'unique mission de decrire ce qui est bas, ce qui est repugnant. . . ."Nous avons commence, nous, par la canaille, parce que la femme et I'homme du peuple, plus rapproches de la nature et de la sauvagerie, sont des creatures simples et peu compliquees, tandis que le Parisien et la Parisienne' de la societe, ces civilises excessifs, dont I'originalite tranchee est faite toute de nuances, toute de demi-teintes, toute de ces riens insaisissables, pareils aux riens coquets et neutres avec lesquels se fagonne le caractere d'une' toilette distinguee de femme, demandant des annees pour qu'on les perce, pour qu'on les sache, pour qu'on les attrape--et le romancier du plus grand genie, croyez- le bien, ne les devinera jamais ces gens de salon, avec les racontars d'amis qui vont pour lui a la decouverte dans le monde. . . ."Ce projet de roman qui devait se passer dans le grand monde, dans le monde le plus quintessencie, et dont nous rassemblions lentement et minutieusement les elements delicats et fugaces, je I'abandonnais apres la mort de men frere, convaincu de I'impossibilite de le reussir tout seul."But this particular paragraph could have had little to do with the matter. "French Poets and Novelists" was published in '78 and Edmond De Goncourt signed theprefaceto"LesFreresZemganno"in'79. Thepara- graphs quoted are interesting, however, as showing De Goncourt's state of mind in that year. He had prob- ably been preaching in this vein long before setting the words on paper, before getting them printed.If ever one man's career was foreshadowed in a few?HENRY JAMES 127sentences of another, Henry James's is to be found in this paragraph.It is very much as if Ije said: I will not be a mega- therium botcher like Balzac ; there is nothing to be said about these De Goncourts, but one must try to be rather more interesting than they are in, let us say, "Madame Gervaisais." *Proceeding with the volume of criticism, we find that "LeJeuneH."simplydidn't"get"Flaubert; thathewas much alive to the solid parts of Turgenev. He shows himself very apt, as we said above, to judge the merits of a novelist on the ground that the people portrayed by the said novelist are or are not suited to reception into the household of Henry James senior; whether, in short, Emma Bovary or Frederic or M. Arnoux would have spoiled the so delicate atmosphere, have juggled the so fine susceptibilities of a refined 23rd Street family at the time of the Philadelphia "Centennial."I find the book not so much a sign that Henry James was "disappointed," as HuefFer puts it, as that he was simply and horribly shocked by the literature of his con- tinental forebears and contemporaries.It is only when he gets to the Theatre Franqais that he finds something which really suits him. Here there is order, tradition, perhaps a slight fustiness (biit a quite pardonable fustiness, an arranged and suitable fustiness having its recompense in a sort of spiritual quiet) ; here, at any rate, was something decorous, something not to be found in Concord or in Albany. And it is easy to imagine the young James, not illuminated by De* It is my personal feeling at the moment that La Fille Elisa is worth so much more than all Balzac that the things are as out of scale as a sapphire and a plum pudding, and that Elisa, despite the dull section, is worth most of James's writing.

"French Poets and Novelists" gives us a point from which to measure Henry James's advance. Genius showed itself partly in the escape from some of his original limitations, partly in acquirements. His art at length became "second nature," became perhaps half unconscious; or in part wholly unconscious; in other partsperhapstoohighlyconscious. Atanyrateinsun- nier circumstances he talked exactly as he wrote, the same elaborate paragraph beautifully attaining its ? cli- max; the same sudden incision when a brief statementcould dispose of a matter.Be it said for his style : he is seldom or never involvedwhen a direct bald statement will accurately convey hisStyle apart, I take it that the hatred of tyrannies was as great a motive as any we can ascribe to Galileo or Leonardo or to any other great figure, to any other mythic Prometheus ; for this driving force we may well overlook personal foibles, the early Bostonese bias, the heritage from his father's concern in commenting Swedenborg,He is not usually, for all hisown meaning, all of it.wideleisure,verbose. Hemaybehighlyandbewilder- ingly figurative in his language (vide Mr. Hueffer's re- marks on this question).?HENRY JAMES 129the later fusses about social caution and conservation of furniture. Hueffer rather boasts about Henry James's innocence of the classics. It is nothing to brag of, even if a man struggling against natural medievalism have entrenched himself in impressionist theory. If James had read his classics, the better Latins especially, he would not have so excessively cobwebbed, fussed, blath- ered,worriedaboutminormundanities. Wemaycon- spuer with all our vigor Henry James's concern with furniture, the Spoils of Poynton, connoisseurship, Mrs. Ward's tea-party atmosphere, the young Bostonian of theimmatureworks. Wemayrelegatethesethingsmen- tally to the same realm as the author's pyjamas and coIt lar buttons, to his intellectual instead of his physical valeting. There remains the capacious intelligence, the searching analysis of things that cannot be so relegated to the scrap-heap and to the wash-basket.Let us say that English freedom legally and tradition- ally has its basis in property. Let us say, a la Balzac, that most modern existence is governed by, or at least interfered with by, the necessity to earn money; let us also say that a Frenchman is not an Englishman or a German or an American, and that despite the remark that the aristocracies of all people, the upper classes, are the same everywhere, racial differences are au fond dif- ferences; they are likewise major subjects.Writing, as I am, for the reader of good-will, for the bewildered person who wants to know where to begin, I need not apologize for the following elliptical notes.

Other stories inferior.1876. (U. S. A.) "Roderick Hudson," prentice work. First novel not up to the level of "Pickering."1877. "The American"; essential James, part of the permanentwork.

Charming Venetian preface in the collected edition.1884. "Tales of Three Cities," stories dropped from the collected edition, save "Lady Barbarina."1884. "Lady Barbarina," a study in English blank- ness comparable to that exposed in the letters of the English young lady in "A Bundle of Letters." There isalsoNewYorkoftheperiod. "Butiftherewasone thing Lady Barb disliked more than another it was de- scribing Pasterns.

LadyBarbof course had never gone into it ; but she knew that in her own class the business was not to express but to enjoy, not to represent but to be represented.""Mrs. Lemon's recognition of this river, I should say, was all it need have been; she held the Hudson existed for the purpose of supplying New Yorkers with poetical feelings, helping them to face comfortably occasions like the present, and in general, meet foreigners with confi- dence. . . .""He believed, or tried to believe, the salon now pos- sible in New York on condition of its being reserved en- tirely for adults; and in having taken a wife out of a country in which social traditions were rich and ancient he had done something toward qualifying his own house so splendidly qualified in all strictly material respects . . . to be the scene of such an effort. A charming woman accustomed only to the best on each side, as Lady Beau- chemin said, what mightn't she achieve by being at home --always to adults only--in an easy early inspiring com- prehensive way and on the evening of the seven, when worldly engagements were least numerous ? He laid this philosophy before Lady Barb in pursuance of a theory that if she disliked New York on a short acquaintance she couldn't fail to like it on a long. Jackson believed in the New York mind--not so much indeed in its lit- erary, artistic, philosophic or political achievements as in its general quickness and nascent adaptability. He clung to this belief, for it was an indispensable neat block in the structure he was attempting to rear. The New York mind would throw its glamour over Lady Barb if--?132 INSTIGATIONSshe would only give it a chance; for it was thoroughly bright, responsive and sympathetic. If she would only set up by the turn of her hand a blest social centre, a temple of interesting talk in which this charming organ might expand and where she might inhale its fragrance in the most convenient and luxurious way, without, as it was, getting up from her chair; if she would only just try this graceful .good-natured experiment--which would make every one like her so much too--he was sure all the wrinkles in the gilded scroll of his fate would be smoothed out. But Lady Barb didn't rise at all to his conception and hadn't the least curiosity about the New Yorkmind. Shethoughtitwouldbeextremelydisagree- able to have a lot of people tumbling in on Sunday eve- ning without being invited, and altogether her husband's sketch of the Anglo-American salon seemed to her to suggest crude familiarity, high vociferation--she had al- ready made a remark to him about 'screeching women'--andrandomextravagantlaughter. Shedidn'ttellhim --for this somehow it wasn't in her power to express and, strangely enough, he never completely guessed it that she was singularly deficient in any natural, or in- deed, acquired understanding of what a salon might be. She had never seen or dreamed of one--and for the most part was incapable of imagining a thing she hadn't seen. She had seen great dinners and balls and* meets and runs and races; she had seen garden-parties andbunches of people, mainly women--who, however, didn't screech--at dull stuffy teas, and distinguished companies collected in splendid castles ; but all this gave her no clew to a train of conversation, to any idea of a social agree- ment that the interest of talk, its continuity, its accu- mulations from season to season shouldn't be lost. Con- versation, in Lady Barb's experience, had never been;?HENRY JAMES133continuous; in such a case it would surely have been a bore. It had been occasional and fragmentary, a trifle jerky, with allusions that were never explained; it had a dread of detail--it seldom pursued anything very far or kept hold of it very long."1885. "Stories Revived," adding to earlier tales "The Author of Beltraffio," which opens with excess of thie treading-on-eggs manner, too much to be borne for twen- ty-four volumes. The pretense of extent of "people" in- terested in art and letters, sic : "It was the most complete presentation that had yet been made of the gospel of art it was a kind of aesthetic war cry. 'People' had endeav- ored to sail nearer "to truth,' etc."He implies too much of art smeared on limited multi- tudes. One wonders if the eighties did in any great aggregate gush up to this extent. Doesn't he try to spread the special case out too wide?The thinking is magnificently done from this passage up to page sixteen or twenty, stated with great concision. Compare it with "Madame Gervaisais" and we find Henry James much more interesting when on the upper reaches. Comparehisexpressiveness,theexpressiveness of his indirectness with that of constatation. The two methods are curiously mixed in the opening of "Beltraf- fio." Such sentences as (page 30) "He said the. most interesting and inspiring things" are, however, pure waste, pure "leaving the thing undone," unconcrete, un- imagined; just simply bad writing or bad novelisting. As for his special case he does say a deal about the au- thor or express a deal by him, but one is bothered by thefact that Pater, Burton, Hardy, Meredith were not, in mere history, bundled into one ; that Burton had been to the East and the others had not; that no English novel- ist of that era would have taken the least notice of any-?134 INSTIGATIONSthing going on in foreign countries, presumably Euro- pean, as does the supreme author of "Beltraffio."Doubtless he is in many ways the author Henry James would have liked to meet and more illustrative of certain English tones and limitations than any historical portrait might have been. Still Henry James does lay it on . . . more, I think, than the story absolutely requires. In "Beltraffio" he certainly does present (not that he does not comment to advantage) the two damn'd women ap- pended to the gentlemanly hero of the tale. The most violent post-Strindbergian school would perhaps have called them bitches tout bonnement, but this word did not belong to Henry James's vocabulary and besides it is of too great an indistinctness. Author, same "bloody"(in the English sense) author with his passion for "form" appears in "Lesson of Master," and most of H. J.'s stories of literary milieux. Perpetual Grandisonism or Grandisonizing of this author with the passion for form, all of 'em have it. Ma che! There is, however, great intensity in these same "be-deared" and be-"poor- old"-edpages.

"Will it be a sin to make the most of that one too, so bad for the dear old novel?" Butler and James on the same side really chucking out the fake ; Butler focused on Church of England ; opposed to him the fakers booming the Bible "as literature" in a sort of last stand, a last ditch; seeing it pretty well had to go as history, cosmogony, etc., or the old tribal Daddy- slap-'em-with-slab of the Jews as anything like an ideal :"He told me more about his wife before we arrived at the gate of home, and if he be judged to have aired overmuch his grievance I'm afraid I must admit that he had some of the foibles as well as the gifts of the artistic temperament; adding,however,instantlythathitherto,to the best of my belief, he had rarely let this particular cat out of the bag.

It's a thing so hollow, so dishonest, so lying, in which life is so blinked and blinded, so dodged and disfigured, that it makes my ears burn. It's two different w^ays of looking at the whole affair,' he repeated, pushing open the gate. 'And they're irreconcilable !' he added with a sigh. We went forward to the house, but on the walk, halfway to the door, he stopped and said to me : 'If you're going into this kind of thing there's a fact you should know beforehand; it may save you some disappointment. There's a hatred of art, there's a hatred of literature-- meanofthegenuinekinds. Oh,theshams thosethey'll swallow by the bucket !' I looked up at the charm- ing house, with its genial color and crookedness, and I answered with a smile that those evil passions might exist, but that I should never have expected to find them there. 'Ah, it doesn't matter, after all,' he a bit nervously laughed ; which I was glad to hear, for I was reproaching myself with having worked him up."Really literature in the XlXth and the beginning of the XXth centuries is where science was in the days of Galileo and the Inquisition. Henry James not blinking it, neither can we. "Poor dears" and "dear olds" always a little too plentiful.1885. (continued) "Pandora," of the best. Let it pass as a sop to America's virginal charm; as counter- weight to "Daisy Miller," or to the lady of "The Por- trait." Henry James alert to the German."The process of enquiry had already begun for him, in spite of his having as yet spoken to none of his fellow passengers; the case being that Vogelstein enquired not only with his tongue, but with his eyes--that is with his spectacles--with his ears, with his nose, with his palate,?HENRY JAMESwithallhissensesandorgans. Hewasahighlyupright young man, whose only fault was that his sense of comedy, or of the humor of things, had never been spe- cifically disengaged, from his several other senses. He vaguely felt that something should be done about this, and in a general manner proposed to do it, for he was on his way to explore a society abounding in comic aspects. This consciousness of a missing measure gave him a certain mistrust of what might be said of him; and if circumspection is the essence of diplomacy our young aspirant promised well. His mind contained several millions of facts, packed too closely together for the light breeze of the imagination to draw through the mass. He was impatient to report himself to his superior in Washington, and the loss of time in an English port could only incommode him, inasmuch as the study of English institutions was no part of his mission. On the other hand the day was charming; the blue sea, in Southampton Water, pricked all over with light, had no movement but that of its infinite shimmer. Moreover, he was by no means sure that he should be happy in the United States, where doubtless he should find himself soon enough disembarked. He knew that this was not an important question and that happiness was an un- scientific term, such as a man of his education should be ashamed to use even in the silence of his thoughts. Lost none the less in the inconsiderate crowd and feeling himself neither in his own country nor in that to which he was in a manner accredited, he was reduced to his mere personality; so that during the hour, to save his importance, he cultivated such ground as lay in sight for a judgment of this delay to which the German steamer was subjected in English waters. Mightn't it be proved, facts, figures and documents--or at least137:?138 INSTIGATIONSwatch--in hand, considerably greater than the occasion demanded ?"Count Vogelstein, was still young enough in diplomacy to think it necessary to have opinions. He had a good many, indeed, which had been formed without difSculty; they had been received ready-made from a line of an- cestors who knew what they liked. This was of course --and under pressure, being candid, he would have ad- mitted it--an unscientific way of furnishing one's mind. Our young man was a stiff conservative, a Junker of Junkers; he thought modern democracy a temporary phase and expected to find many arguments against it in the great Republic. In regard to these things it was a pleasure to him to feel that, with his complete training, he had been taught thoroughly to appreciate the nature of evidence. The ship was heavily laden with German emigrants, whose mission in the United States differed considerably from Count Otto's. They hung over the bulwarks, densely grouped; they leaned forward on their elbows for hours, their shoulders kept on a level with their ears: the men in furred caps, smoking long- bowled pipes, the women with babies hidden in remark- ably ugly shawls. Some were yellow Germans and some were black, and all looked greasy and matted with the sea-damp. They were destined to swell still further the huge current of the Western democracy; and Count Vogelstein doubtless said to himself that they wouldn't improve its quality. Their numbers, however, were striking, and I know not what he thought of the nature of this particular evidence."For further style in vignette"He could see for himself that Mr. and Mrs. Day had not at all her grand air. They were fat plain serious?HENRY JAMES"people who sat side by side on the deck for hours and looked straight before them. Mrs. Day had a white face,largecheeksandsmalleyes; herforeheadwassur- rounded with a multitude of little tight black curls; her lips moved as if she had always a lozenge in her mouth. She wore entwined about her head an article which Mrs. Dangierfield spoke of as a 'nuby,' a knitted pink scarf concealing her hair, encircling her neck and having among its convolutions a hole for her perfectly expres- sionless face. Her hands were folded on her stomach, and in her still, swathed figure hier bead-like eyes, which occasionally changed their direction, alone represented life. Her husband had a stiff gray beard on his chin and a bare spacious upper lip, to which constant shaving had imparted a hard glaze. His eyebrows were thick and his nostrils wide, and when he was uncovered, in the saloon, it was visible that his grizzled hair was dense and perpendicular. He might have looked rather grim and truculent hadn't it been for the mild familiar ac- commodating gaze with which his large light-colored pupils--the leisurely eyes of a silent man--appeared to consider surrounding objects. He was evidently more friendly than fierce, but he was more diffident than friendly. He liked to have you in sight, but wouldn't have pretended to understand you much or to classify you, and would have been sorry it should put you under an obligation. He and his wife spoke sometimes, but seldom talked, and there was something vague and pa- tient about them as if they had become victims of a wrought spell. The spell, however, was of no sinister cast ; it was the fascination of prosperity, the confidence of security, which sometimes makes people arrogant, but which had had such a different effect on this simple139:?I40 INSTIGATIONSsatisfied pair, in whom further development of every kind appeared to have been happily arrested."Pandora's approach to her parents"These little offices were usually performed deftly, rapidly, with the minimum of words, and when their daughter drew near them. Mr. and Mrs. Day closed their eyes after the fashion of a pair of household dogs who expect to be scratched."The tale is another synthesis of some of the million reasons why Germany will never conquer the world, why the Hun is impossible, wh}- ''boche"' is merely "bursch." The imbecility of a certain Wellsian journalist in treat- ing this gem is again proof that it is written for the relatively-developed American, not for the island ecaillere. If Henry James, as Ford jMadox Hueffer says, set out to civilize the United States, it is at least an easier job than raising British Suburbia to a bearable level. From that milieu at least we have nothing of value to learn; we shall not take our tonality from that niveau.In describing "Pandoras'' success as "purely personal,"' Henry James has hit on the secret of the Quattrocento, 1450 to 1550, the vital part of the Renaissance. Aris- tocracy decays when it ceases to be selective, when the basis of selection is not personal. It is a critical acute- ness, not a snobbism, which last is selection on some other principle than that of a personal quality. It is servility to rule-of-thumb criteria, and a dullness of per- ception, a timidity in acceptance. The whole force of the Renaissance was in the personality of its selection.There is no faking the amount of perceptive energy concentrated in Henry James's vignettes in such phrases?HENRY JAMES 141as that on the parents like domestic dogs waiting to be scratched, or in the ten thousand phrases of this sort which abound in his writings. If we were back in the time of Bruyere, we could easily make a whole book of "Characters" from Henry James's vignettes* The vein holds from beginning to end of his work; from this writing of the eighties to "The Ivory Tower." As for example, Gussie Braddon:"Rosanna waited facing her, noting her extraordinary perfection of neatness, of elegance, of arrangement, of which it couldn't be said whether they most handed over to you, as on some polished salver, the clear truth of her essential commonness or transposed it into an element that could please, that could even fascinate, as a supreme attestation of care. 'Take her as an advertisement of allthe latest knowledges of how to "treat" every inch of the human surface and where to "get" every scrap of the personal envelope, so far as she is enveloped, and she does achieve an effect sublime in itself and thereby"absolute in a wavering world.'We note no inconsiderable progress in the actual writ-ing, in maestria, when we reach the ultimate volumes. 1886. "Bostonians." Other stories in this collectionmostly rejected from collected edition."Princess Casamassimaj" inferior continuation of"Roderick Hudson." His original subject matter is be- ginning to go thin.* Since writing the above I find that some such compilation has been attempted; had indeed been planned by the anthologist, and, in plan, approved by H. J. : "Pictures and Passages from Henry James" selected by Ruth Head (Chatto and Windus, 1916), if not exactly the book to convince the rising generation of H. J.'s powers of survival, is at any rate a most charming tribute to our subject from one who had begun to read him in "the eighties".?142 INSTIGATIONS1888. "The Reverberator," process of fantasia begin- ning.Fantasia of Americans vs. the '"old aristocracy," "The American"withthesexesreversed. Possiblythetheme shows as well in "Les Transatlantiques," the two meth- ods, give one at least a cenain pleasure of contrast.1888. "Aspern Papers," inferior. "Louisa Pallant," a study in the maternal or abysmal relation, good James. "Modern Warning," rejected from collected edition.1-889. "A London Life." "The Patagonia.""ThePatagonia,"notamasterpiece. Slowinopening, excellent in parts, but the sense of the finale intrudes all along. It seems true but there is no alternative ending. One doubts whether a story is really constructed with any mastery when the end, for the purpose of making it a story, is so unescapable. The effect of reality is pro- duced, of course, by the reality of the people in the opening scene; there is no doubt about that part being "to the life.""The Liar" is superb in its way, perhaps the best of the allegories, of the plots invented purely to be an expo- sition of impression. It is magnificent in its presenta- tion of the people, both the old man and the Liar, who is masterly."Mrs. Temperly" is another such excellent delineation and shows James as an excellent hater, but G. S. Street expresses a concentration of annoyance with a greater polish and suavity in method ; and neither explains, theorizes, nor comments.James never has De Maupassant's reality. His (H. J.'s) people almost always convince, i.e., we believe implicitly that they exist. We also think that HenryJames has made up some sort of story as an excuse for writing his impression of the people.?HENRY JAMES 143One sees the slight vacancy of the stories of this period, the short clear sentence, the dallying with jeu d'esprit, with epigram no better than, though not inferior to, the run of epigram in the nineties. It all explains James's need of opacity, his reaching out for a chiaro- scuro to distinguish himself from his contemporaries and in which he could put the whole of his much more com- plex apperception.Then comes, roughly, the period of cobwebs and of excessive cobwebs and of furniture, finally justified in "The Finer Grain," a book of tales witli no mis-fire, and the style so vindicated in the triumphs of the various books of Memoirs and "The American Scene."Fantasias : "Dominic Ferrand," "Nona Vincent" (tales obviously aimed at the "Yellow Book," but seem to have missed it, a detour in James's career). All artists who discover anything make such detours and must, in thecourse of things (as in the cobwebs), push certain ex- periments beyond the right curve of their art. This is not so much the doom as the function of all "revolu- tionary" or experimental art, and I think masterwork is usually the result of the return from such excess. One does not know, simply does not know, the true curve until one has pushed one's method beyond it. Until then it is merely a frontier, not a chosen route. It is an open question, and there is no dogmatic answer, whether an artist should write and rewrite the same story (a la Flaubert) or whether he should take a new canvas."The Papers," a fantasia, diverting; "The Birthplace," fairy-godmother element mentioned above, excellent. "Edmund Orme," inferior; "Yellow Book" tale, not ac- cepted by that periodical.1889-1893. Period of this entoilment in the "Yellow?144 INSTIGATIONSBook," short sentences, the epigrammatic. He reacts from this into the allegorical. In general the work of. this period is not up to the mark. "The Chaperon," "The Real Thing," fantasias of "wit." By fantasias I mean sketches in which the people are "real" or convince one of their verity, but where the story is utterly unconvinc- ing, is not intended to convince, is merely a sort of exag- geration of the fitting situation or the situation which ought to result in order to display some type at its apo- gee. "The Real Thing" rather better than other stories in this volume.Thus the lady and gentleman model in "The Real Thing." London society is finely ladled in "The Chape- ron," which is almost as a story, romanticism."Greville Fane" is a scandalous photograph from the life about which the great blagueur scandalously lies in hispreface(collectededition). Ihavebeentoodiverted comparing it with an original to give a sane view of its art.1890. "The Tragic Muse," uneven, full of good things but showing Henry James in the didactic role a little too openly. He preaches, he also displays fine per- ception of the parochialism of the British political ca- reer. It is a readable novel with tracts interpolated.(Excellent and commendable tracts arguing certainly for the right thing, enjoyable, etc.) Excellent text-book for young men with ambitions, etc.1892. "Lesson of the Master" (cobweb). "The Pu- pil," a masterpiece, one of his best and keenest studies. "Brooksmith" of the best.1893. "ThePrivateLife."Titlestory,wasteverbiage at the start, ridiculous to put all this camouflage over something au fond merely an idea. Not life, not peo- ple, allegory, dated to 'Yellow Book" era. Won't hold?HENRY JAMES 145against "Candide." H. J.'s tilting against the vacuity of the public figure is, naturally, pleasing, i. e., it is pleasing that he should tilt, but the amusement partakes of the nature of seeing cocoanuts hurled at an aunt sally.There are other stories, good enough to be carried by H. J.'s best work, not detrimental, but not enough to have "made him": "Europe" (Hawthorny), "Paste," "The Middle Years," "Broken Wings," etc. Part of the great man's work can perhaps only be criticized as "etc."1895. "Terminations, Coxon Fund," perhaps best of this lot, a disquisition, but entertaining, perhaps the germ of Galsworthy to be found in it (to no glory of either author) as perhaps a residuum of Dickens in Maisie's Mrs. Wix. Verbalism, but delightful verbalism in Coxon affair, sic:"Already, at hungry twenty-six, Gravener looked as blank and parliamentary as if he were fifty and popular,"or"a deeply wronged, justly resentful, quite irreproach-able and insufferable person" 1 or (for the whole type)"put such ignorance into her cleverness?"Miss Anvoy's echo concerning "a crystal" is excel- lently introduced, but is possibly in the nature of a sleight of hand trick (contemporary with "Lady Windemere's Fan"). Does H. J.'s "politics" remind one of Dizzy's scribbling, just a little? "Confidence, under the new Ministry, was understood to be reviving," etc.Perhaps one covers the ground by saying that the James of this period is "light literature," entertaining if onehavenothingbettertodo. Neither"Terminations" nor (1896) "Embarrassments" would have founded a reputation.1896-97. Improvement through "Other House" and?146 INSTIGATIONS"Spoils of Poynton."

Only real thing the im- pression of people, not observation or real knowledge. Action only to give reader the tone, symbolizing the tone of the people. Opening tour de force, a study in punks, a cheese souMe of the leprous crust of society done to a turn and a niceness save where he puts on the dulcis- simo, vox humana, stop. James was the dispassionate observer. He started with the moral obsession ; before he had worked clear of it he was entoiled in the ob- session of social tone. He has pages of clear depiction, even of satire, but the sentimentalist is always lurking just round the corner. This softens his edges. He has not the clear hardness, the cold satiric justness that G. S. Street has displayed in treating situations, certain struggles between certain idiocies and certain vulgarities. This book is a specialite of local interest. It is an etude in ephemera. If it contained any revelation in 1899, it no longer contains it. His characters are reduced to the status of voyeurs, elaborate analysis of the much toospecial cases, a bundle of swine and asses who cannot mind their own business, who do not know enough to mind their own business. James's lamentable lack of the classics is perhaps responsible for his absorption in bagatelles. . . . He has no real series of backgrounds of moeurs du passe, only the "sweet dim faded lavender" tune and in opposition to modernity, plush nickel-plated, to the disparagement, naturally, of the latter.?HENRY JAMES 147Kipling's "Bigod, now-I-know-all-about-this manner," is an annoyance, but one wonders if parts of Kipling by the sheer force of content, of tale to tell, will not outlastmostofJames'scobwebs. Thereisnosubstitute for narrative-sense, however many diiferent and en- trancing charms may be spread before us."The Awkward Age" might have been done, from one point of view, as satire, in one-fourth the space. On the other hand, James does give us the subtly graded atmos- pheres of his different houses most excellently. And indeed, this may be regarded as his subject.If one were advocate instead of critic, one would definitely claim that these atmospheres, nuances, im- pressions of personal tone and quality are his subject; that in these he gets certain things that almost no one elsehaddonebeforehim. Thesetimbresandtonalities are his stronghold, he is ignorant of nearly everything else. It is all very well to say that modern life is largely made up of velleities, atmospheres, timbres, nuances, etc., but if people really spent as much time fussing, to the extent of the Jamesian fuss about such normal trifling, age-old affairs, as slight inclinations to adultery, slight disinclinations to marry, to refrain from marrying, etc., etc., life would scarcely be worth the bother of keeping on with it. It is also contendable that one must depict such mush in order to abolish it.** Most good prose arises, perhaps, from an instinct of nega- tion ; is the detailed, convincing analysis of something detesta- ble; of something which one wants to eliminate. Poetry is the assertion of a positive, i. e., of desire, and endures for a longer period. Poetic satire is only an assertion of this positive, in- versely, i. e., as of an opposite hatred.This is a highly untechnical, unimpressionist, in fact almost theological manner of statement; but is perhaps the root differ- ence between the two arts of literature.Most good poetry asserts something to be worth while, or?148 ? INSTIGATIONSThe main feeling in "The Awkward Age" is satiric. The dashes of sentiment do n9t help the work as liter- ature. The acute observer is often referred to:Page 131. "The ingenious observer just now sug- gested might even have detected . . ."Page 133. "And it might have been apparent still to our sharp spectator . . ."Page 310. "But the acute observer we are constantly taking for granted would perhaps have detected . . ."Page 323. "A supposititious spectator would cer- tainly have imagined . . ." (This also occurs in "Ivory Tower." Page 196.)This scrutinous person wastes a great deal of time in pretending to conceal his contempt for Mrs. Brook, Vanderbank, the other punks, and lays it on so thick when presenting his old sentimentalist Longdon, who at the one critical moment behaves with a stupidity,damns a contrary; at any rate asserts emotional values. The best prose is, has been a presentation (complicated and elabo- rate as you like) of circumstances, of conditions, for the most part abominable, or at the mildest, amendable. This assertion of the more or less -objectionable only becomes doctrinaire and rotten art when the narrator mis-states from dogmatic bias, and when he suggests some quack remedy (prohibition, Chris- tianity, social theory of one sort or another), the only cure being that humanity should display more intelligence and good- will than humanity is capable of displaying.Poetry = Emotional synthesis, quite as real, quite as realist as any prose (or intellectual) analysis.Neither prose nor drama can attain poetic intensity save by construction, almost by scenario; by so arranging the circum- stance that some perfectly simple speech, perception, dogmatic statement appears in abnormal vigor. Thus when Frederic in L'Education observes Mme. Arnoux's shoe-laces as she is de- scending the stair; or in Turgenev the statement, quotation of a Russian proverb about the "heart of another", or "Nothing but death is irrevocable" toward the end of Nichee de Gentils- hotnmes.?HENRY JAMES 149with a lack of delicacy, since we are dealing with these refinements. Of course neither this stupidity of his action nor the tone of the other characters has anything to do with the question of maestria, if they were dis- passionatelyorimpartiallyrendered. Thebookisweak because all through it James is so manifestly carrying on a long tenzone so fiercely and loudly, a long argument for the old lavender. There is also the constant impli- cation that Vanderbank ought to want Nanda, though why the devil he should be supposed to be even mildly under this obligation, is not made clear. A basis in the classics, castor oil, even Stevenson's "Virginibus Puerisque"mighthavehelpedmatters. One'scomplaint is not that people of this sort don't exist, that they aren't like everything else a subject for literature, but thatJames doesn't anywhere in the book get down to bed- rock. It is too much as if he were depicting stage scenery not as stage scenery, but as nature.All this critique is very possibly an exaggeration. Take it at half its strength ; I do not intend to defend it. Epigrammatic manner in opening, compare Kipling; compare De Maupassant, superb ideas, verity, fantasia, fantasia group, reality, charming stories, poppycock. "Yellow Book" touches in "The Real Thing," general statements about their souls, near to bad writing, per-fectly lucid."Nona Vincent," he writes like an adolescent, mightbe a person of eighteen doing first story.Page 201. "Public interest in spiritual life of thearmy." ("The Real Thing.")Page 201. German Invasion.Loathsome prigs, stiflF conventions, editor of cheapmagazines ladled in Sir Wots-his-name.1893. In the interim he had brought out "In the?T50 INSTIGATIONSCage," excellent opening sentence, Aiatter too much talked around and around, and "The Two Magics." This last a Freudian affair which seems to me to have attract- ed undue interest, i.e., interest out of proportion to the importance as literature and as part of Henry James's own work, because of this subject matter. The obscen- ity of "The Turn of the Screw" has given it undue prom- inence. People now "drawn" to obscene as were people of Milton's period by an equally disgusting bigotry; one unconscious on author's part; the other, a surgical treat- ment of a disease. Thus much for progress on part of authorsifpublichasnotprogressed. Thepointofmy remarks is that an extraneous criterion comes in. One must keep to the question of literature, not of irrelevan- cies. Galdos' "Lo Prohibido" does Freud long before the sex crank got to it. Kipling really does the psychic, ghosts, etc., to say nothing of his having the "sense of story."1900. "The Soft Side," collection containing: "The Abasement of the Northmores," good ; again the motif of the vacuity of the public man, the "figure" ; he has tried it again in "The Private Life," which, however, falls into the allegorical. A rotten fall it is too, and Henry James at his worst in it, -i.e., the allegorical. "Fordham's Castle" appears in the collected edition only--it may be- long to this period but is probably earlier, comedietta, excellently, perhaps flawlessly done. Here, as so often, the circumstances are mostly a description of the char- acter of the personal tone of the "sitters" ; for his people are so much more, or so much more often, "sitters" than actors. Protagonists it may be. When they act, they are apt to stage-act, which reduces their action again to being a mere attempt at description. ("The Liar," for?HENRY JAMES 151example.) Compare Maupassant's "Toine" for treat- ment of case similar to "Fordham Castle."1902-05. "The Sacred Fount," "Wings of a' Dove," "Golden Bowl" period."Dove" and "Bowl" certainly not models for other writers, a caviare not part of the canon (metaphors be hanged for the moment).Henry James is certainly not a model for narrativenovelists,foryoungwritersoffiction perhapsnoteven ;a subject of study till they have attained some sublimity of the critical sense or are at least ready to be constantly alert, constantly on guard.I cannot see that he will harm a critic or a describer of places, a recorder of impressions, whether they be people, places, music.1903. "Better Sort," mildish.1903. "The Ambassadors," rather clearer than the other work. Etude of Paris vs. Woollett. Exhortation to the idle, well-to-do, to leave home.1907. "TheAmericanScene/'triumphoftheauthor's long practice. A creation of America. A book no "serious American" will neglect. How many Americans make any attempt toward a realization of that country is of course beyond our power to compute. The desire to see the national face in a mirror may be in itself an exotic. I know of no such grave record, of no such attempt at faithful portrayal, as "The American Scene.'' Thus America is to the careful observer; this volume and the American scenes in the fiction and memoirs, in "The Europeans," "The Patagonia," "Washington Square," etc., bulk large in the very small amount of writing which can be counted as history of moeurs con- temporaines, of national habit of our time and of the?152 INSTIGATIONStwo or three generations preceding us. Newport, the standardized face, the Capitol, Independence Hall, the absence of penetralia, innocence, essential vagueness, etc., language "only definable as not in intention Yid- dish," the tabernacle of Grant's ashes, the public collapse oftheindividual,theSt.Gaudensstatue. Thereisnoth- ingtobegainedbymakingexcerpts; thevolumeislarge, but one should in time drift through it. I mean any American with pretenses to an intellectual life should drift through it. It is not enough to have perused "The Constitution" and to have "heerd tell" of the national founders.1910. "The Finer Grain," collection of short stories without a slip. "The Velvet Glove," "Mona Mon- travers," "A Round of Visits" (the old New York versus the new), "Crapey Cornelia," "The Bench of Desolation."It is by beginning on this collection, or perhaps taking it after such stories as "The Pupil" and "Brooksmith," that the general literate reader will best come to James, must in brief be convinced of him and can tell whether ornotthe"marginal"Jamesisforhim. Whetherorno the involutions of the "Golden Bowl" will titillate his ar- cane sensibilities. If the reader does not "get" "The Finer Grain" there is no sense in his trying the more elaborate "Wings of a Dove," "Sacred Fount," "Golden Bowl." If, on the contrary, he does feel the peculiar, unclassic attraction of the author he may or may not enjoy the uncanonical books.191 1. "The Outcry," a relapse. Connoisseurship fad again, inferior work.1913. "A Small Boy and Others," the beginning of the memoirs. Beginning of this volume disgusting.

Reader might start about here, any reader, that is, to whom New York of that period is of interest. New York of the fifties is significant, in so far as it is typical of what a hundred smaller American cities have been since. The tone of the work shows in excerpts"The special shade of its identity was thus that it was not conscious--really not conscious of anything in the world; or was conscious of so few possibilities at least, and these so immediate and so a matter of course, that it came almost to the same thing. That was the testimony that the slight subjects in question strike me as having borne to their surrounding medium--^the fact that their."Or later, when dealing with a pre-Y.-M.-C.-A.America."Infinitely queer and quaint, almost incongruouslydroll, the sense somehow begotten in ourselves, as very young persons, of our being surrounded by a slightly remote, yet dimly rich, outer and quite kindred circle of the tipsy. I remember how, once, as a very small boy, after meeting in J;he hall a most amiable and irreproach- able gentleman, all but closely consanguineous, who had come to call on my mother, I anticipated his further entrance by slipping in to report to that parent that I thought he must be tipsy. And I was to recall per- fectly afterwards the impression I so made on her--in which the general proposition that the gentlemen of a certain group or connection might on occasion be bestdescribed by the term I had used, sought to destroy the particular presumption that our visitor wouldn't, by his ordinary measure, show himself for one of these.

There was clearly no mean, least of all the golden one, for it was just the ready, even when the moderate, possession ofgold that determined, that hurried on disaster. There were whole sets and groups, there were 'sympathetic,' though too susceptible, races, that seemed scarce to recognize or to find possible any practical application of moneyed, that is, of transmitted ease, however limited, but to go more or less rapidly to the bad with it which meant even then going as often as possible toParis .""The field was strictly covered, to my young eyes, I make out, by three classes, the busy, the tipsy, and Daniel Webster. . . .""It has carried me far from my rather evident propo- sition that if we saw the 'natural' so happily embodied about us--and in female maturity, or comparative ma- turity, scarce less than in female adolescence--this wasbecause the artificial, or in other words the complicated,."..was so little there to threaten it. . .?HENRY JAMESOn page 72 he quotes his father on "flagrant morality."

The American's enjoyment of England in "The Passion- ate Pilgrim" is more searching than anything continental. Windy generality in "Tour in France," and perhaps indi- cation of how little Henry James's tentacles penetrated into any era before 1600, or perhaps before 1780.Vignette bottom of page 337-8 ("Passionate Pilgrim")' "full of glimpses a.nd responses, of deserts and desola-^ tions." "His perceptions would be fine and his opinions pathetic." Commiseration of Searle vs. detachment, in "Four Meetings."Of the posthumous work, "The Middle Years" is per- haps the most charming. "The Ivory Tower," full of accumulated perceptions, swift illuminating phrases, perhapspartofamasterpiece. "TheSenseofthePast," less important. I leave my comment of "The Middle Years" as I wrote it, but have recast the analysis of notes to "The Ivory Tower."Flaubert is in six volumes, four or five of which every literate man must at one time or another assault. James is strewn over about forty^--part of which must go into desuetude, have perhaps done so already.I have not in these notes attempted the Paterine art of appreciation, e.g., as in taking the perhaps sole read- able paragraph of Pico Mirandola and writing an em- purpled descant.The problem--discussion of which is about as "artis- tic" as a street map--is: can we conceive a five or six volume edition of James so selected as to hold its own internationally? My contention is for this possibility.My notes are no more than a tentative suggestion, to wit: that some such compact edition might be, to ad- vantage, tried on the less patient public. I have been, alas, no more fortunate than our subject in keeping out:;?HENRY JAMES 157irrelevant, non-esthetic, non-literary, non-technical vistas and strictures."THE MIDDLE YEARS"The Middle Years is a tale of the great adventure for, putting aside a few simple adventures, sentimental, phallic, Nimrodic, the remaining great adventure is pre- cisely the approach to the Metropolis ; for the provincial of our race the specific approach to London, and no subject surely could more heighten the pitch of writing than that the treated approach should be that of the greatest writer of our time and own particular language. We may, I think, set aside Thomas Hardy as of an age not our own ; of perhaps Walter Scott's or of L'Abbe Prevost's, but remote from us and things familiarly under our hand ; and we skip over the next few crops of writers as lacking in any comparative interest, interest in a writer being primarily in his degree of sensitiza- tion; and on this count we may throw out the whole Wells-Bennett period, for what interest can we take in instruments which must of nature miss two-thirds of the vibrations in any conceivable situation? In James the maximum sensibility compatible with efficient writ- ing was present. Indeed, in reading these pages one can but despair over the inadequacy of one's own literary sensitization, one's so utterly inferior state of aware- ness ; even allowing for what the author himself allows his not really, perhaps, having felt at twenty-six, all that at seventy he more or less read into the memory of his feeling. The point is that with the exception of excep- tional moments in Hueffer, we find no trace of such degree of awareness in the next lot of writers, or until the first novels of Lewis and Joyce, whose awareness is, without saying, of a nature greatly different in kind.158 INSTIGATIOIS^SIt is not the book for any reader to tackle who has not read a good deal of James, or who has not, in default of that reading, been endowed with a natural Jamesian sensibility (a case almost negligible by any likelihood) ; neither is it a book of memoirs, I mean one does not turn to it seeking information about Vic- torian worthies ; any more than one did, when the old man himself was talking, want to be told anything ; there are encyclopedias in sufficiency, and statistics, and human mines of information, boring sufficiency; one asked and asks only that the slow voice should continue--evaluat- ing, or perhaps only tying up the strands of a sentence "Andhowmyold friend . . . Howells . . ." etcThe effects of H. J.'s first breakfasts in Liverpool, invited upstairs at Half Moon Street, are of infinitely more value than any anecdotes of the Laureate (even though H. J.'s inability not to see all through the Laure- ate is compensated by a quip melting one's personal objection to anything Tennyson touched, by making him merely an old gentleman whatsoever with a gleam of fun in his make-up).All comers to the contrary, and the proportionate sale of his works, and statistics whatsoever to the contrary, only an American who has come abroad will ever draw all the succulence from Henry James's writings; the denizen of Manchester or Wellington may know what it feels like to reach London, the Londoner bom will not be able quite to reconstruct even this part of the book; and if for intimacy H. J. might have stayed at the same hotel on the same day as one's grandfather; and if the same American names had part in one's own inceptions in London, one's own so wholly different and less padded inceptions; one has perhaps a purely per- sonal, selfish, unliterary sense of intimacy: with, in my:??HENRY JAMES 159own case, the vast unbridgeable diiiference of settling-in and escape.The essence of James is that he is always "settling-in," it is the ground-tone of his genius.Apart from the state of James's sensibility on arrival nothing else matters, the "mildness of the critical air," the fatuity of George Eliot's husband, the illustrational and accomplished lady, even the faculty for a portrait in a paragraph, not to be matched by contemporary effects in half-metric, are indeed all subordinate to one's curiosity as to what Henry James knew, and what he didnotknowonlanding. Theportraitoftheauthoron the cover showing him bearded, and looking rather like a cross between a bishop and a Cape Cod longshoreman, is an incident gratuitous, interesting, but in no way con- nected with the young man of the text.The England of a still rather whiskered age, never looking inward, in short, the Victorian, is exquisitely em- balmed, and "niounted," as is, I think, the term for microscopy. The book is just the right length as a volume, but one mourns there not being twenty more, for here is the unfinished work . . . not in "The Sense of the Past," for there the pen was weary, as it had been in "The Outcry," and the talent that was never most worth its own while when gone off on connoisseurship, was, conceivably, finished; but here in his depiction of his earlier self the verve returned in full vigor.THE NOTES TO "THE IVORY TOWER" *The great artists among men of letters have occasion- ally and by tradition burst into an Ars Poetica or an Arte nuevo de hacer Comedias, and it should come as no* Recast from an article in The Future.--?i6o INSTIGATIONSsurprise that Henry James has left us some sort of treatise on novel-writing--no siirprise, that is, to the discriminating reader who is not, for the most part, a writer of English novels. Various reviewers have hinted obscurely that some such treatise is either adum-^ brated or concealed in the Notes for "The Ivory Tower" and for "The Sense of the Past"; they have said, in- deed, that novelists will "profit greatly," etc., but no one has set forth the gist or the generalities which are to be found in these notes.Divested of its fine verbiage, of its cliches, of its pro- vincialisms of American phrase, and of the special de- tails relating to the particular book in his mind, the formula for building a novel (any novel, not merely any "psychological" novel) ; the things to have clearly in mind before starting to write it are enumerated in "The Ivory Tower" notes somewhat as follows :1. Choice of names for characters; names that will "fit" their owners, and that will not "joggle" or be cacophonic when in juxtaposition on the page.2. Exposition of one group of characters and of the "situation." (In "The Ivory Tower" this was to be done in three subdivisions. "Book I" was to give the "Im- mediate Facts.")3. One character at least is hitched to his "character- istic." We are to have one character's impression on another.4. (Book III.) Various reactions and interactions of characters.5. The character, i.e., the main character, is "faced with the situation."6. For"TheIvoryTower"andprobablyforanynovel, there is now need to show clearly and definitely the "antecedents," i.e., anything that had happened before?HENRY JAMES i6ithe story started. And we find Henry James making up his mind which characters have interacted before this story opens, and which things are to be due to fresh impacts of one character on another.7. Particular consideration of the special case in hand. The working-free from incongruities inherent in the first vague preconceptions of the plot. Thus:(a) The hinge of the thing is not to be the effect of A.onB.orofB.onA.; norofA.onC.or ofC.onB.; butistobeduetoaneffectall round, of A. and. B. and C. working on each other.(b) James's care not to repeat figures from earlier novels. Not a categoric prohibition, but a cau- tion not to sail too near the wind in this matter.(c) A care not to get too many "personally remark- able" people, and not enough stupid ones into the story.(d) Care for the relative "weight" as well as the varied "tone" of the characters.(We observe, in all this, the peculiarly American pas- sion for "art"; for having a system in things, cf. Whistler.)(e) Consideration how far one character "faces" the problem of another character's "character."(This and section "d" continue the preoccupation with "moral values" shown in James's early criticism in "French Poets and Novelists.")8. Definite "joints"; or relations of one character to another finally fitted and settled.This brings us again to point 5. The character, i.e., the main character definitely "faced" with the situation.9. The consequences.?i62 INSTIGATIONS10. (a) Further consideration of the state of char- acter C. before contact with B., etc.(b) The effect of further characters on the. mind, and thence on the action of A.(c) Considerations of the effect of a fourth main character; of introducing a subsidiary char- acter, and its effect, i.e., that of having an extra character for a particular function.11. The great "coup" foreshadowed.(In this case the mild Othello, more and more drifting consciously into the grip of the mild lago--I use the terms "Othello" and "lago" merely to avoid, if not "hero," at least "villain" ; the sensitive temperament al- lowing the rapacious temperament to become effective.)(a) The main character in perplexity as to how far he shall combat the drift of things.(b) The opposed character's perception of this.(These sub-sections are, of course, sub-sections for a psychological novel; one would have different but equivalent "joints" in a novel of action.)(c) Effect of all this on third character. (In this case female, attracted to "man-of-action" qual- ity).(d) A.'s general perception of these things and his weighing of values, a phase solely for the psy- chological novel.(e) Weighing of how much A.'s perception of the relations between B. and C. is to be denouement, and how much, more or less, known.12. Main character's "solution" or vision of what course he will take.13. The fourth character's "break into" things, or into a perception of things,(a) Actions of an auxiliary character, of what would?HENRY JAMES 163have been low life in old Spanish or Elizabethan drama. This character affects the main action (as sometimes a "gracioso" [servant, buffoon, Sancho Panza] affects the main action in a play, for example, of Lope de Vega's),(b) Caution not to let author's interest in fascinat- ing auxiliary character run away with his whole plan and design.(This kind of restraint is precisely what leaves a reader "wanting more" ; which gives a novel the "feel" ofbeingfulloflife; convincesthereaderofanabundant energy, an abundant sense of life in an author.)14. Effects of course of the action on fourth main character and on the others. The scale being kept by the relation here not being between main character and one antagonist, but with a group of three people, rela- tions "different" though their "point" is the same; cf. a main character vs. a Rosenkrantz and Guildenstern, or "attendant lords." James always has half an eye on play construction; the scene. ,(a) The second auxiliary character brought out more definitely. (This is accidental. It might hap- pen at any suitable point in a story wherever needed.)(b) Act of this auxiliary person reaches through to main action.15. We see the author determining just how bad a case he is going to make his villain.(a) Further detei-mination of his hero. (In this case an absolute non-producer, non-accumu- lator.)(b) Care not to get an unmixed "bad" in his "villain," but to keep a right balance, a dependency, in?i64 INSTIGATIONSthis case, on the main character's weakness oreasiness,(c) Decision how the main "coup" or transfer shallslide through.i6. Effect upon C. Effect upon main characters' re-lations to D., E. and F.At this point, in the consideration of eight of the ten"books" of his novel, we see the author most intent on his composition or architecture, most anxious to get all the sections fitted in with the greatest economy, a sort "of crux of his excitement and anxiety, a fullness of his perception that the thing must be so tightly packed that no sentence can afford to be out of place.17. Climax.- The Deus or, in this case, Dea, ex machina. Devices for prolonging climax. The fourth main character having been, as it were, held back for a sort of weight or balance here, and as a "resolution" of the tangles.Finis.18. Author's final considerations of time scheme, i.e., fitting the action into time not too great for unity, and great enough to allow for needed complexity. Slighter consideration of place scheme; where final scenes shall be laid, etc.Here in a few paragraphs are the bare bones of the plan described in eighty of Henry James's pages. The detailed thoroughness of this plan, the complicated con- sciousness displayed in it, gives us the measure of this author's superiority, as conscious artist, over the "nor- mal" British novelist, i.e., over the sort of person who tells you that when he did his first book he "just sat down and wrote the first paragraph," and then found he "couldn't stop." This he tells you in a manner clearly implying that, from that humble beginning to the shining?HENRY JAMES 165hour of the present, he has given the matter no further thought, and that his succeeding works were all knocked off with equal simplicity.I give this outline with such fullness because it is a landmark in the history of the novel, as written in Eng- lish. It is inconceivable that Fielding or Richardson should have left, or that Thomas Hardy should leave, such testimony to a comprehension of the novel as a "form." The Notes are, on the other hand, quite dis- tinct from the voluminous, prefaces which so many French poets write before they have done anything else. James, we note, wrote no prefaces until there were twenty-four volumes of his novels and stories waiting to be collected and republished. The Notes are simply the accumulation of his craftsman's knowledge, they are,in all their length, the summary of the things he would have, as a matter of habit, in his mind before embark- ing on composition.I take it rather as a sign of editorial woodenheaded- ness that these Notes are printed at the end of "The Ivory Tower" ; if one have sense enough to suspect that the typical mentality of the elderly heavy reviewer has been shown, one will for oneself reverse the order ; read the notes with interest and turn to the text already with the excitement of the sport or with the zest to see if, with this chance of creating the masterpiece so outlined, the distinguished author is going to make good. If on the other hand one reads the unfinished text, there is no escaping the boredom of re-reading in skeleton, with tentative and confusing names, the bare statement of what has been, in the text, more fully set before us.The text is attestation of the rich, banked-up per- ception of the author. I dare say the snap and rattle of the fun, or much of it, will be only half perceptible to?i66 INSTIGATIONSthose who do not know both banks of the Atlantic; but enough remains to show the author at his best; despite the fact that occasionally he puts in the mouths of his characters sentences or phrases that no one but he hira? self could have used. I cannot attribute this to the unfinished state of the manuscript. These oversights are few, but they are the kind of slip which occurs in his earlier work. We note also that his novel is a descriptive novel, not a novel that simply depicts people speaking and moving. There is a constant dissertation goingon,andinitisourmajorenjoyment. TheNotesto "The Sense of the Past" are not so fine a specimen of method, as they are the plan not of a whole book, but only of the latter section. The editor is quite right to print them at the end of the volume.Of the actual writing in the three posthumous books, far the most charming is to be found in "The Middle Years." Here again one is not much concerned with Mr. James's mildly ironic reminiscences of Tennyson and the Victorians, but rather with James's own tempera- ment, and with his recording of inn-rooms, breakfasts, butlers, etc., very much as he had done in his fiction. There is no need for its being "memoirs" at all; call the protagonist Mr. Ponsonby or Mr. Hampton, obliterate the known names of celebrities and half celebrities, andthe whole thing becomes a James novel, and, so far as it goes, a mate to the best of them.Retaining the name of the author, any faithful reader of James, or at any rate the attentive student, finds a good deal of amusement in deciphering the young James, his temperament as mellowed by recollection and here recorded forty years later, and then in contrasting it with the young James as revealed or even "betrayed" in his own early criticisms, "French Poets and Novelists,"?HENRY JAMES 167a mueh cruder and more savagely puritanical and plainly New England product with, however, certain permanent traits of his character already in evidence, and with a critical faculty keen enough to hit on certain weaknesses in the authors analyzed, often with profundity, and with often a "rightness" in his mistakes. I mean that apparent errors are at times only an excess of zeal and overshooting of his mark, which was to make for an improvement, by him, of certain defects.?IllREMY DE GOURMONTA DISTINCTION followed by notesThe mind of Remy de Gourmont was less like the mind of Henry James than any contemporary mind I can think of. James' drawing of nueurs contemporaines was so circumstantial, so concerned with the setting, with detail, nuance, social aroma, that his transcripts were "out of date" almost before his books had gone into a second edition; out of date that is, in the sense that his interpretations of society could never serve as a guide to such supposititious utilitarian members of the next gen- eration as might so desire to use them.He has left his scene and his characters, unalterable as the little paper flowers permanently visible inside the lumpy glass paperweights. He was a great man of letters, a great artist in portrayal ; he was concerned with mental temperatures, circumvolvulous social pressures, the clash of contending conventions, as Hogarth with the cut of contemporary coats.On no occasion would any man of my generation have broached an intimate idea to H. J., or to Thomas Hardy, O.M., or, years since, to Swinburne, or even to Mr. Yeats with any feeling that the said idea was likely to be received, grasped, comprehended. However much168?REMY DE GOURMONT 169onemayhaveadmiredYeats'poetry; howevermuchone may have been admonished by Henry' James' prose works, one has never thought of agreeing with either.You could, on the other hand, have said to De Gour-mont anything that came into your head you could have ;sent him anything you had written with a reasonable assurance that he would have known what you were driving at. If this distinction is purely my own, and subjective, and even if it be wholly untrue, one will be very hard pressed to find any other man born in the "fifties" of whom it is even suggestible.De Gourmont prepared our era; behind him there stretches a limitless darkness; there was the counter- reformation, still extant in the English printer; there was the restoration of the Inquisition by the Catholic Roman Church, holy and apostolic, in the year of grace 1824; there was the Mephistopheles period, morals of the opera left over from the Spanish XVIIth century plays of "capa y espada"; Don Juan for subject mat- ter, etc. ; there was the period of English Christian big- otry, Saml. Smiles, exhibition of '51 ("Centennial of '76"), machine-made building "ornament," etc., enduring in the people who did not read Saml. Butler; there was the Emerson-Tennysonian plus optimism period; there was the "aesthetic" era during which pieople "wrought" as the impeccable Beerbohm has noted; there was the period of funny symboliste trappings, "sin," satanism, rosy cross, heavy lilies, Jersey Lilies, etc.,"Ch'hanno perduto il ben del intelletto"all these periods had mislaid the light of the XVIIIth century; though in the symbolistes Gourmont had his beginning.?170 INSTIGATIONS II.In contradiction to, in wholly antipodal distinction from, Henry James, De Gourmont was an artist of the nude. Hewasanintelligencealmostmorethananar- tist; whenheportrays,heisconcernedwithhardlymore than the permanent human elements. His people are only by accident of any particular era. He is poet, more by possessing a certain quality of mind than by virtue of having written fine poems; you could scarcely con- tend that he was a novelist.He was intensely aware of the differences of emo- tional timbre; and as a man's message is precisely his fagon de voir, his modality of apperception, this particu- lar awareness was his "message."Where James is concerned with the social tone of his subjects, with their entourage, with their superstes of dogmatized "form," ethic, etc., De Gourmont is con- cerned with their modality and resonance in emotion.Mauve, Fanette, Neobelle, La Vierge aux Platres, are all studies in different permanent kinds of people; they are not the results of environments or of "social causes," their circumstance is an accident and is on the whole scarcely alluded to. Gourmont differentiates his charac- ters by the modes of their sensibility, not by sub-degrees of their state of civilization.He recognizes the right of individuals to feel differ- ently. Confucian, Epicurean, a considerer and enter- tainer of ideas, this complicated sensuous wisdom is al- most the one ubiquitous element, the "self" which keeps his superficially heterogeneous work vaguely "unified."The study of emotion does not follow a set chrono- logical arc; it extends from the "Physique de 1'Amour"?REMY DE GOURMONT/ 171to "Le Latin Mystique"; from the condensation of Fabre's knowledge of insects to"Amas ut facias pulchram"in the Seqttaire of Goddeschalk(in "Le Latin Mystique").He had passed the point where people take abstractstatementofdogmafor"enlightenment." An"idea"has little value apart from the modality of the mind which receives it. It is a railway from one state to another, and as dull as steel rails in a desert.The emotions are equal before the aesthetic judgment. He does not grant the duality of body and soul, or at least suggests that this mediaeval duality is unsatisfac- tory; there is an interpenetration, an osmosis of body andsoul,atleastforhypothesis. "Mywordsaretheun- spoken words of my body."And in all his exquisite treatment of all emotion he will satisfy many whom August Strindberg, for egre- gious example, will not. From the studies of insects to Christine evoked from the thoughts of Diomede, sex is not a monstrosity or an exclusively German study.* And the entire race is not bound to the habits of the mantis orofotherinsectsequallymelodramatic. Sex,insofar as it is not a purely physiological reproductive mechan- ism, lies in the domain of aesthetics, the junction of tactile and magnetic senses ; as some people have accurate ears both for rhythm and for pitch, and as some are tone deaf, some impervious to rhythmic subtlety and variety, so in this other field of the senses some desire the trivial, some the processional, the stately, the master-work.As some people are good judges of music, and insen- sible to painting and sculpture, so the fineness ot one* "A German study," Hobson ; "A German study," Tarr.?172 INSTIGATIONSsense entails no corresponding fineness in another, or at least no corresponding critical perception of differences.III.Emotions to Henry James were more or less things that other people had and that one didn't go into ; at any rate not in drawing rooms. The gods had not visited James, and the Muse, whom he so frequently mentions, appeared doubtless in corsage, the narrow waist, the sleeves puffed at the shoulders, a la mode 1890-2.De Gourmont is interested in hardly anything save emotions, and the ideas that will go into them, or take life in emotional application. (Apperceptive rather than active.)One reads Les Chevaux de Diomede (1897) as one would have listened to incense in the old Imperial court. There are many spirits incapable. De Gourmont calls it a "romance of possible adventures" ; it might be called equally an ai'oma, the fragrance of roses and poplars, the savor of wisdoms, not part of the canon of literature, a book like "Daphnis and Chloe" or like Marcel Schwob's"LivredeMonelle"; notasolidaritylikeFlau- bert; but an osmosis, a pervasion."My true life is in the unspoken words of my body."In "Une Nuit au Luxembourg," the characters talk at more length, and the movement is less convincing. "Diomede" was De Gourmont's own favorite and we may take it as the best of his art, as the most complete expression of his particular "faQon d'apercevoir"; if, even in it, the characters do little but talk philosophy, or rather drift into philosophic expression out of a haze of images, they are for all that very real. It is the climax?REMY DE GOURMONT 173of his method of presenting characters differentiated by emotional timbre, a process which had begun in "His- ToiRES Magiques" (1895); and in "D'un Pays Loin- tain" (published 1898, in reprint from periodicals of 1892-4)."SoNGE d'une Femme" (1899) is a novel of modern life, De Gourmont's sexual intelligence, as contrasted to Strindberg'ssexualstupiditywellinevidence. Thework is untranslatable into English, but should be used before 30 by young men who have been during their undergrad- uate days too deeply inebriated with the Vita Nuova."Tout ce qui se passe dans la vie, c'est de la mauvaise litterature.""La vraie terre natale est celle ou on a eu sa premiere emotion forte.""La virginite n'est pas une vertu, c'est un etat; c'est une sous-division des couleurs."Livres de chevet for those whom the Strindbergian school will always leave aloof."Les imbeciles ont choisi le beau comme les oiseaux choisissentcequiestgras. Labetiseleursertdecornes." "CoEUR Virginal" (1907) is a light novel, amusing,and accurate in its psychology.I do not think it possible to overemphasize Gourmont'ssense of beauty. The mist clings to the lacquer. His spirit was the spirit of Omakitsu; his pays natal was near to the peach-blossom-fountain of the untranslatable poem. If the Ufe of Diomede is overdone and done badly in modern Paris, the wisdom of the book is not thereby invalidated. It may be that Paris has need of some more Spartan corrective, but for the descendants of witch-burners Diomede is a needful communication.?174 INSTIGATIONS IV.As Voltaire was a needed light in the i8th cen- tury, so in our time Fabre and Frazer have been essen- tials in the mental furnishings of any contemporary mind qualified to .write of ethics or philosophy or that mixed molasses religion. "The Golden Bough" has supplied the data which Voltaire's incisions had shown to be lack- ing. It has been a positive succeeding his negative. It is not necessary perhaps to read Fabre and Frazer en- tire, but one must be aware of them; people unaware of them invalidate all their own writing by simple igno- rance, and their work goes ultimately to the scrap heap."Physique de l'Amour" (1903) should be used as a text book of biology. Between this biological basis in instinct, and the "Sequaire of Goddeschalk" in "Le Latin Mystique" (1892) stretch Gourmont's studies of amour and aesthetics. If in Diomede we find an Epicurean receptivity, a certain aloofness, an observation of con- tacts and auditions, in contrast to the Propertian atti- tude:Ingenium nobis ipsa puella facit,this is perhaps balanced by"Sans vous, je crois bien que je n'aimerais plus beau- coup et que je n'aurais plus une extreme confiance ni dans la vie ni moi-meme." (In "Lettres a I'Ama- zone.")But there is nothing more unsatisfactory than saying that De Gourmont "had such and such ideas" or held "such and such views," the thing is that he held ideas, in-;;?REMY DE GOURMONT 175tuitions, perceptions in a certain personal exquisite man- ner. In a criticism of him, "criticism" being an over violent word, in, let us say, an indication of him, one wants merely to show that one has oneself made certain dissociations; as here, between the aesthetic receptivity of tactile and magnetic values, of the perception of beauty in these relationships, and the conception of love, passion, emotion as an intellectual instigation; such as Propertius claims it; such as we find it declared in the King of Navarre's"De fine amor vient science et beaute"and constantly in the troubadours.(I cannot repeat too often that there was a profoundpsychological knowledge in mediaeval Provence, how- ever Gothic its expression ; that men, concentrated on certain validities, attaining an exact and diversified ter- minology, have there displayed considerable penetration that this was carried into early Italian poetry ; and faded from it when metaphors became decorative instead of interpretative; and that the age of Aquinas would not have tolerated sloppy expression of psychology concur- rent with the exact expression of "mysticism." There is also great wisdom in Ovid. Passons!)De Gourmont's wisdom is not wholly unlike the wis- dom which those ignorant of Latin may, if the gods favor their understanding, derive from Gelding's "Met- amorphoses."Barbarian ethics proceed by general taboos. Gour- mont's essays collected into various volumes, "Prome- nades," "Epilogues," etc., are perhaps the. best ihtro-:?176 INSTIGATIONSduction to the ideas of our time that any unfortunate, suddenly emerging from Peru, Peoria, Oshkosh, Ice- land, Kochin, or other out-of-the-way lost continent could desire. A set of Landor's collected works will go fur- ther towards civilizing a man than any university educa- tion now on the market. Montaigne condensed Renais- sance awareness. Even so small a collection as Lionel Johnson's "Post Liminium" might save a man from utter barbarity.But if, for example, a raw graduate were contemplat- ing a burst into intellectual company, he would be less likely to utter unutterable betisses, gaffes, etc., after read- ing Gourmont than before. One cannot of course cre- ate intelligence in a numbskull.Needless to say, Gourmont's essays are of uneven value as the necessary subject matter is of uneven value. Taken together, proportionately placed in his work, they are a portrait of the civilized mind. I incline to think them the best portrait available, the best record that is, of the civilized mind from 1885-1915.There are plenty of people who do not know what the civilized mind is like, just as there were plenty of mules in England who did not read Landor contemporaneously, orwhodidnotinhisdayreadMontaigne. Civilization is individual.Gourmont arouses the senses of the imagination, pre- paring the mind for receptivities. His wisdom, if not of the senses, is at any rate via the senses. We base our "science" on perceptions, but our ethics have not yet at- tained this palpable basis.In 1898, "Pays Lointain" (reprinted from magazine publication of 1892-4), De Gourmont was beginning his method?REMY DE GOURMONT177"Douze crimes pour I'honneur de I'iniini."He treats the special case, cases as special as any ofJames', but segregated on different demarcative lines. His style had attained the vividness of"Sa vocation etait de paraitre malheureuse, de passer dans la vie comme une ombre gemissante, d'inspirer de la pitie, du doute et de I'inquietude.

It is work done in establishing good work, a necessary scaffolding, the debt to !)& Gourmont, because of it, is ethical rather than artistic. It is a worthy thing to have done. One should not reproach flaws, even if it appears that the author wastes time in this criticism, although this particular sort of half energy probably wouldn't have been any use for more creative or even more formulative writing. It is not a carving of statues, but only holding a torch for the public; ancillary writing. Local and temporal, introduc- ing some men now better known and some, thank Heaven, unknown or forgotten."Deuxieme LrniE des Masques" (1898), rather more important, longer essays, subjects apparently chosen more freely, leaves one perhaps more eager to read Al- fred Valette's "Le Vierge" than any other book men- tioned."Etre nul arrete dans son developpement vers une nullite equilibree."We find typical Gourmont in the essay on Rictus:"Ici c'est I'idee de la resignation qui trouble le Pauvre comme tant d'autres, il la confond avec I'idee bouddhiste de non-activite. Cela n'a pas d'autre importance en un temps ou Ton confond tout, et ou un cerveau capable d'associer et de dissocier logiquement les idees doit etre considere comme une production miraculeuse de la Nature."Or I'art ne joue pas ; il est grave, meme quand il rit, meme quarid il danse.

Jehcm Rictus.He almost convinces one of Ephraim Mikhail's poetry, by his skillful leading up to quotation of"Mais le ciel gris est plein de tristesse caline Ineffablement douce aux coeurs charges d'ennuis."The essay on the Goncourt is important, and we find in it typical dissociation.'Avec de la patience, on atteint quelquefois I'exacti- tude, et avec de la conscience, la veracite; ce sont les qualites fondamentales de I'histoire."Quand on a goute a ce vin on ne veut plus boire I'ordi- naire^ vinasse des bas litterateurs.

Le style peut se fatiguer comme I'honune meme ; il vieillira de meme que I'intelligenceetlasensibilitedontilestlesigne; maispas plus que I'individu, il ne changera de personnalite, a moins d'un cataclysme psychologique. Le regime ali- mentaire, le sejour a la campagne ou a Paris, les occupa- tions sentimentales et leurs suites, les maladies ont bien plus d'influence sur un style vrai que les mauvaises lec- tures. Le style est un produit physiologique, et I'un des plus constants; quoique dans la dependance des diverses fonctions vitales."Les Etats-Unis tomberaient en langueur, sans les;?REMY DE GOURMONT 189voyages en Europe de leur aristocratie, sans la diversite extreme des climats, des sols et par consequent des races en evolution dans ce vaste empire.

L'etude de Racine ne deviendra profitable que dans plusieurs siecles et seulement a condition que, completement oublie, il semble entierement nouveau, en- tierement etranger, tel que le sont devenus pour le public d'aujourd'hui Adenes li Rois ou Jean de Meung.

Pourcela,je vous servirai autant qu'il sera en mon pouvoir. Je ne crois pas que je puisse beaucoup.

Mais pourquoi ne pas I'entreprendre ? En tous les pays, il y a un noyau de bons esprits, d'esprits libres, il faut leur donner quelque chose qui les change de la fadeur des magazines, quelque chose qui leur donne confiance en eux-memes et leur soit un point d'appui.

And this aim should be yours.""Are they capable of enough mental liberty to read my books, for example, without being horrified? I think this very doubtful, and it will need long preparation. But why not try it ? There are in all countries knots of intelligent people, open-minded ; one must give something to relieve them from the staleness of magazines, some- thing which will give them confidence in themselves and serve as a rallying point. As you say, one must begin by getting them to respect French individualism; the sense of liberty which some of us have in so great degree.

Essay first published in Poetry, 1917.196?IN THE VORTEX 197The few poems which Mr. Eliof has given us maintain this proportion, as they maintain other proportions of art. After much contemporary work that is merely factitious, much that is good in intention but impotently unfinished and incomplete ; much whose flaws are due to sheer igno- rance which a year's study or thought might have reme- died, it is a comfort to come upon complete art, naive despite its intellectual subtlety, lacking all pretense.It is quite safe to compare Mr. Eliot's work with any- thing written in French, English or American since the death of Jules Laforgue. The reader will find nothing better, and he will be extremely fortunate if he finds much half as good.The necessity, or at least the advisability of comparing English or American work with French work is not readily granted by the usual English or American writer. If you suggest it, the Englishman answers that he has not thought about it--he does not see why he should bother himself about what goes on south of the channel; the American replies by stating that you are "no longer American." This is the bitterest jibe in his vocabulary. The net result is that it is extremely difficult to read one's contemporaries. Afteratimeonetiresof"promise."I should like the reader to note how complete is Mr. Eliot's depiction of our contemporary condition. He has not confined himself to genre nor to society portraiture. Hislonely men in shirt-sleeves leaning out of windows are as real as his ladies whocome and go Talking of Michelangelo.His "one night cheap hotels" are as much "there" as are his?198 INSTIGATIONSfour wax candles in the darkened room, Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead, An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb.And, above all, there is no rhetoric, although there is Elizabethanreadinginthebackground. WereIaFrench critic, skilled in their elaborate art of writing books about books, I should probably go to some length discussing Mr. Eliot's two sorts of metaphor: his wholly unrealiz- able, always apt, half ironic suggestion, and his precise realizable picture. It would be possible to point out his method of conveying a whole situation and half a char- acter by three words of a quoted phrase; his constant aliveness, his mingling of very subtle observation with the unexpectedness of a backhanded cliche. It is, how- ever,extremelydangeroustopointoutsuchdevices. The method is Mr. Eliot's own, but as soon as one has re- duced even a fragment of it to formula, some one else, not Mr. Eliot, some one else wholly lacking in his apti- tudes, will at once try to make poetry by mimicking his externalprocedure. Andthisindefinite"someone"will, needless to say, make a botch of it.For what the statement is worth, Mr. Eliot's work in- terests me more than that of any other poet now writing in English.* The most interesting poems in Victorian English are Browning's "Men and Women," or, if that statement is too absolute, let me contend that the form of these poems is the most vital form of that period of English, and that the poems written in that form are the least like each other in content. Antiquity gave us Ovid's "Heroides" and Theocritus' woman using magic- The form of Browning's "Men and Women" is more alive*A. D. 1917.;?IN THE VORTEX 199than the epistolary form of the "Heroides." Browning included a certain amount of radocination and of purely intellectual comment, and in just that proportion he lost intensity. SinceBrowningtherehavebeenveryfewgood poems of this sort. Mr. Eliot has made two notable ad- ditions to the list. And he has placed his people in con- temporary settings, which is much more difficult than to render them with mediaeval romantic trappings. If it is permitted to make comparison with a different art, let me say that he has used contemporary detail very much as Velasquez used contemporary detail in "Las Meninas" the cold gray-green tones of the Spanish painter have, it seems to me, an emotional value not unlike the emotional value of Mr. Eliot's rhythms, and of his vocabulary.James Joyce has written the best novel of my decade, and perhaps the best criticism of it has come from a Bel- gian who said, "All this is as true of my country as of Ireland." Eliot has a like ubiquity of application. Art does not avoid utiiversals, it strikes at them all the harder in that it strikes through particulars. Eliot's work rests"'! apart from that of the many new writers who have used the present freedoms to no advantage, who have gained no new precisions of language, and no variety in their cadence. His men in shirt-sleeves, and his society ladies, are not a local manifestation; they are the stuff of our/ modern world, and true of more countries than one. I would praise the work for its fine toile, its humanity, and its realism ; for all good art is realism of one sort or an- other.It is complained that Eliot is lacking in emotion. "La Figlia che Piange" is an adequate confutation.If the reader wishes mastery of "regular form," the "Conversation Galante" is sufficient to show that symmet- rical form is within Mr. Eliot's grasp. You will hardly?200 V INSTIGATIONSfindsuchneatnesssaveinFrance; suchmodernneatness, save in Laforgue.De Gourmont's phrase to the contrary notwithstanding, the supreme test of a book is that we should feel some unusualintelligenceworkingbehindthewords. Bythis test various other new books, that I have, or might have, beside me, go to pieces. The barrels of sham poetry that every decade and school and fashion produce, go to pieces. It is sometimes extremely difficult to find any other particular reason for their being so. unsatisfactory. I have expressly written here not "intellect" but "intelli- gence." Thereisnointelligencewithoutemotion. The emotionmaybeanteriororconcurrent. Theremaybe emotion without much intelligence, but that does not con- cern us.   Versification:A conviction as to the rightness or wrongness of vers libre is no guarantee of a poet. I doubt if there is much use trying to classify the various kinds of vers libre, but there is an anarchy which may be vastly overdone; and there is a monotony of bad usage as tiresome as any typical eighteenth or nineteenth century flatness.In a recent article Mr. Eliot contended, or seemed to contend, that good vers libre was little more than a skilful evasionofthebetterknownEnglishmetres. Hisarticle was defective in that he omitted all consideration of metres depending on quantity, alliteration, etc. ; in fact, he wrote as if metres were measured by accent. This may have been tactful on his part, it may have brought his article nearer to the comprehension of his readers (that is, those of the "New Statesman," people chiefly concerned with sociology of the "button" and "unit" vari- ety). But he came nearer the fact when he wrote else-?IN THE VORTEX 201where : "No vers is libre for the man who wants to do a good job."Alexandrine and other grammarians have made cubby- holes for various groupings of syllables; they have put names upon them, and have given various labels to "metres" consisting of combinations of these different groups. Thus it would be hard to escape contact with somegrouporother; onlyanencyclopedistcouldeverbe half sure he had done so. The known categories would allow a fair liberty to the most conscientious traditional- ist. The most fanatical vers-librist will escape them with difficulty. However, I do not think there is any cry- ing need for verse with absolutely no rhythmical basis.On the other hand, I do not believe that Chopin wrote toametronome. Thereisundoubtedlyasenseofmusic that takes count of the "shape" of the rhythm in a mel- ody rather than of bar divisions, which came rather late in the history of written music and were certainly not the first or most important thing that musicians attempted to record. The creation of such shapes is part of the- matic invention. Some musicians have the faculty of in- vention, rhythmic, melodic. Likewise some poets.Treatises full of musical notes and of long and short marks have never been convincingly useful. Find a man with thematic invention and all he can say is that he gets what the Celts call a "chune" in his head, and that the words "go into it," or when they don't "go into it" they "stick out and worry him."You can not force a person to play a musical master- piece correctly, even by having the notes "correctly" printed on the paper before him; neither can you force a person to feel the movement of poetry, be the metre "regular" or "irregular." I have heard Mr. Yeats try- ing to read Burns, struggling in vain to fit the "Birks o'?202 INSTIGATIONSAberfeldy'' and "Bonnie Alexander" into the mournful l<eenofthe"WindamongtheReeds." Eveninregular metres there are incompatible systems of music.I have heard the best orchestral conductor in England read poems in free verse, poems in which the rhythm was so faint as to be almost imperceptible. He read them with the author's cadence, with flawless correctness. A distinguished statesman read from the same book, with the intonations of a legal document, paying no attention to themovementinherentinthewordsbeforehim. Ihave heard a celebrated Dante scholar and mediaeval enthusi- ast read the sonnets of the "Vita Nuova" as if they were not only prose, but the ignominious prose of a man de- void of emotions : an utter castration.The leader of orchestra said to me, "There is more for a musician in a few lines with something rough or un- even, such as Byron'sThere be none of Beauty's daughters With a magic like thee;than in whole pages of regular poetry."IJnless a man can put some thematic invention intoI'ers lihre, he would perhaps do well to stick to "regular" metres, which have certain chances of being musical from their form, and certain other chances of being musical throughhisfailureinfittingtheform. Inverslibrehis musical chances are but in sensitivity and invention.Mr. Eliot is one of the very few who have given a personal rhythm, an identifiable quality of sound as wdl as of style. And at any rate, his book is the best thing in poetry since . . . (for the sake of peace I will leave thatdatetotheimagination).

T. Palgrave, there is a new edition of James Joyce's "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man." t It is extremely gratifying that this book should have "reached its fourth thousand," and the fact is significant in just so far as it marks the beginning of a new phase of English publishing, a phase comparable to that started in France some years ago by the Mercure.The old houses, even those, or even more those, Which once had a literary tradition, or at least literary preten- sions, having ceased to care a damn about literature, the lovers of good writing have "stinick"; have sufficiently banded themselves together to get a few good books into print, and even into circulation. The actual output is small in bulk, a few brochures of translations, Eliot's "Prufrock," Joyce's "A Portrait," and Wyndham Lewis' "Tarr," but I have it on good authority that at least one other periodical will start publishing its authors after the War, so there are new rods in pickle for the old fat-stom- ached contingent and for the cardboard generation.Joyce's"APortrait"isliterature; ithasbecomealmost the prose bible of a few people, and I think I have en- countered at least three hundred admirers of the book, certainly that number of people who, whether they "like" it or not, are wholly convinced of its merits.Mr. Wells I have encountered in print, where he says that Joyce has a cloacal obsession, but he also says that Mr. Joyce writes literature and that his book is to be ranked with the works of Sterne and of Swift.* The Future, May, 1918.t "A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man." Egoist, Ltd. London. Huebsch,NewYork.--'?204 INSTIGATIONSWells is no man to babble of obsessions, but let it stand to his honor that he came out with a fine burst of admiration for a younger and half-known writer.From England and America there has come a finer volume of praise for this novel than for any that I can remember. There has also come impotent spitting and objurgation from the back-woods and from Mr. Dent's office boy, and, as offset, interesting comment in modem Greek, French and Italian.Joyce's poems have been reprinted by Elkin Mathews, his short stories re-issued, and a second novel started in "The Little Review."For all the book's being so familiar, it is pleasant to take up "A Portrait" in its new exiguous form, and one enters many speculations, perhaps more than when one read it initially. It is not that one can open to a forgot- ten page so much as that wherever one opens there is always a place to start; some sentence like"Stephen looked down coldly on the oblong skull be- neath him overgrown with tangled twine-colored hair"; or"Frowsy girls sat along the curbstones before their baskets" ; or"He drained his third cup of watery tea to the dregs and set to chewing the crusts of fried bread that were scattered near him, staring into the dark pool of the jar.

The box of pawntickets at his elbow had just been rifled, and he took up idly one after another in his greasy fingers the blue and white dockets, scrawled and sanded and creased and bearing the name of the pledger as Daly or MacEvoy."i Pair Buskins, &c."::?IN THE VORTEX^ I do not mean to imply that a novel is necess\ bad novel because one can pick it up without beft^ this manner caught and dragged into reading; but indicate the curiously seductive interest of the clear-\ and definite sentences.Neither, emphatically, is it to be supposed that Joyce's writing is merely a depiction of the sordid. The sordid is there in all conscience as you would find it in De Gon- court, but Joyce's power is in his scope. The reach of his writing is from the fried breadcrusts and from the fig-seeds in Cranley's teeth to the casual discussion of Aquinas"He wrote a hymn for Maundy Thursday.

It is the bass and treble ofhismethod. Andhehashisscopebeyondthatofthe novelists his contemporaries, in just so far as whole stretches of his keyboard are utterly out of their com- pass.The conclusion or moral termination from all of which is that the great writers of any period must be the re-....'?--j5 instigationsmarkable minds of that period ; they must know the ex- tremes of their time; they must not represent a social status; they cannot be the "Grocer" or the "Dilettante" with the egregious and capital letter, nor yet the profes- sor or the professing wearer of Jaeger or professional eater of herbs.In the three hundred pages of "A Portrait of the Artist as a. Young Man'' there is no omission ; there is nothing in life so beautiful that Joyce cannot touch it without profanation--without, above all, the profana- tions of sentiment and sentimentality--and there is nothing so sordid that he cannot treat it with his metal- lic exactitude.I think there are few people who can read Shaw, Wells, Bennett, or even Conrad (who is in a category apart) without feeling that there are values and tonalities to which these authors are wholly insensitive. I do not imply that there cannot be excellent art within quite dis- tinct limitations, but the artist cannot afford to be or to appear ignorant of such limitations ; he cannot afford a pretenseofsuchignorance. Hemustalmostchoosehis limitations. If he paints a snuff-box or a stage scene he must not be ignorant of the fact, he must not think he is painting a landscape, three feet by two feet, in oils.I think that what tires me more than anything else in the writers now past middle age is that they always seem to imply that they are giving us all modern life, the whole social panorama, all the instruments of the orchestra. Joyce is of another donation.His earlier book, "Dubliners," contained several well- constructed stories, several sketches rather lacking in form. Itwasadefinitepromiseofwhatwastocome. There is very little to be said in praise of it which would not apply with greater force to "A Portrait." I find that--?IN THE VORTEX 207whoever reads one book inevitably sets out in search of the other.The quality and distinction of the poems in the first half of Mr. Joyce's "Chamber Music" (new edition, pub- lished by Elkin Mathews, 4A, Cork Street, W.i, at is. 3d.) is due in part to their author's strict musical train- ing. We have here the lyric in some of its best tradi- tions, and one pardons certain trifling inversions, much against the taste of the moment, for the sake of the clean- cut ivory finish, and for the interest of the rhythms, thecross run of the beat and the word, as of a stiff wind cutting the ripple-tops of bright water.The wording is Elizabethan, the metres at times sug- gesting Herrick, but in no case have I been able to find a poem which is not in some way Joyce's own, even though he would seem, and that most markedly, to shun apparent originality, as in:Who goes amid the green wood With springtide all adorning her?Who goes amid the rtierry green wood To make it merrier?Who passes in the sunlightBy ways that know the light footfall ?Who passes in the sweet sunlight With mien so virginal?The ways of all the woodland Gleam with a soft and golden fireFor whom does all the sunny woodland Carry so brave attire?--?2o8 INSTIGATIONSO, it is for my true loveThe woods their rich apparel wearO, it is for my true love, That is so young and fair.Here, as in nearly every poem, the motif is so slight that the poem scarcely exists until one thinks of it as set to music ; and the workmanship is so delicate that out of twenty readers scarce one will notice its fineness. If Henry Lawes were alive again he might make the suit- able music, for the cadence is here worthy of his cun- ning:O, it is for my true love. That is so young and fair.The musician's work is very nearly done for him, and yet how few song-setters could be trusted to finish it and to fill in an accompaniment.The tone of the book deepens with the poem begin- ning:O sweetheart, hear you Your lover's tale;A man shall have sorrow When friends him fail.For he shall know then Friends be untrue;And a little ashes Their words come to.The collection comes to its end and climax in two pro- foundly emotional poems ; quite different in tonality and--;:;?IN THE VORTEX 209in rhythm-quality, from the lyrics in the first part of the book :All day I hear the noise of waters Making moan,Sad as the sea-bird is, when going Forth alone.He hears the wind cry to the waters' Monotone.The gray winds, the cold winds are blowing Where I go.I hear the noise of many waters Far below.All day, all night, I hear them flowing To and fro.The third and fifth lines should not be read with an end stop. I think the rush of the words will escape the notice of scarcely any one. The phantom hearing in this poem is coupled, in the next poem, to phantom vision, and to a robustezza of expressionI hear an army charging upon the land.And the thunder of horses plunging, foam about theirkneesArrqgant, in black armour, behind them stand.Disdaining the reins, with fluttering whips, the chari- oteers.They cry unto the night their battle-nameI moan in sleep when I hear afar their whirling laugh-ter;They cleave the gloom of dreams, a blinding flame,Qanging, clanging upon the heart as upon an anvil.:;?2IO INSTIGATIONSThey come shaking in triumph their long green hair They come out of the sea and run shouting by theshoreMy heart, have you no wisdom thus to despair ?My love, my love, my love, why have you left me alone ?In both these poems we have a strength and a fibrous- ness of sound which almost prohibits the thought of their being "set to music," or to any music but that which is in them when spoken; but we notice a similarity of the technique to that of the earlier poems, in so far as the beauty of movement is produced by a very skilful, or per- haps we should say a deeply intuitive, interruption of metric mechanical regularity. It is the irregularity which has shown always in the best periods.The book is an excellent antidote for those who find Mr. Joyce's prose "disagreeable" and who at once fly to conclusions about Mr. Joyce's "cloacal obsessions." I have yet to find in Joyce's published works a violent or malodorous phrase which does not justify itself not only by its verity, but by its heightening of some opposite ef- fect, by the poignancy which it imparts to some emotion ortosomethwarteddesireforbeauty. Disgustwiththe sordid is but another expression of a sensitiveness to the finer thing. There is no perception of beauty without a corresponding disgust. If the price for such artists as James Joyce is exceeding heavy, it is the artist himself who pays, and if Armageddon has taught us anything it should have taught us to abominate the half-truth, and the tellers of the half-truth in literature.ULYSSESIncomplete as I write this. His profoundest work,?IN THE VORTEX 211most significant--"Exiles" was a side-step, necessary ka- tharsis, clearance of mind from continental contempo- rary thought--"Ulysses," obscure, even obscene, as life itself is obscene in places, but an impassioned meditation on life.He has done what Flaubert set out to do in "Bouvard and Pecuchet," done it better, more succinct. An epitome. "Bloom" answers the query that people made after "The Portrait." Joyce has created his second charac- ter; he has moved from autobiography to the creation of the complimentary figure. Bloom on life, death, res- urrection, inimortality. Bloom and the Venus de Milo. Bloom brings life into the book. All Bloom is vital. Talk of the other characters, cryptic, perhaps too partic- ular, incomprehensible save to people who know Dublin, at least by hearsay, and who have university education plusmedisevalism. Butunavoidableoralmostunavoid-able, given the subject and the place of the subject.Note: I am tired of rewriting the arguments for the realist novel; besides there is nothing to add. The Brothers de Goncourt said the thing once and for all, but despite the lapse of time their work is still insufficiently known to the American reader. The program in the preface to "Germinie Lacerteux" states the case and the whole case for realism; one can yot improve the statement. I therefore give it entire, ad majorilm Dei gloriam."PREFACEDe la premiere editionII nous faut demander pardon au public de lui donner ce livre, et I'avertir de ce qu'il y trouvera.Le public aime les romans faux: ce roman est un ro- man vrai.II aime les livres qui font semblant d'aller dans le monde,: ce livre vient de la rue.?212 INSTIGATIONSII aime les petites oeuvres polissonnes, les memoires de filles, les confessions d'alcoves, les saletes erotiques, le scandale qui se retrousse dans une image aux devan- tures des libraires, ce qu'il va lire est severe et pur.

Whenthepublicorthe"publishers"are ready for a volume of Lewis, suitably illustrated, I am ready to write in the letterpress, though Mr. Lewis would do it better than I could.He will rank among the great instigators and great inventors of design; there is mastery in his use of vari- ous media (my own interest in his work centres largely in the "drawing" completed with inks, water-color, chalk, etc.). His name is constantly bracketed with that of Gaudier, Piccasso, Joyce, but these are fortuitous couplings. Lewis' painting is further from the public than were the carvings of Gaudier; Lewis is an older artist, maturer, fuller of greater variety and invention. His work is almost unknown to the public. His name is wholly familiar, BLAST is familiar, the "Timon" portfolio has been seen.I had known him for seven years, known him as an artist, but I had no idea of his scope until he began mak- ing his preparations to go into the army ; so careless had hebeenofanypublicorprivateapproval. The"work" lay in piles on the floor of an attic ; and from it we gathered most of the hundred or hundred and twenty drawings which now form the bases of the Quinn col- lection and of the Baker collection, (now in the South Kensington museum).As very few people have seen all of these pictures very few people are in any position to contradict me. There are three of his works in this room and I can attest their wearing capacity; as I can attest the duration of my regret for the Red drawing now in the Quinn col- lection which hung here for some months waiting ship- ment; as I can attest the energy and vitality that filled this place while forty drawings of the Quinn assortment stood here waiting also; a demonstration of the differ-?IN THE VORTEX 215ence between "cubism," nature-morte-ism and the vortex of Lewis: sun, energy, sombre emotion, clean-drawing, disgust, penetrating analysis from the qualities finding literary expression in "Tarr" to the stasis of the Red Duet, from the metallic gleam of the "Timon" portfolio to the velvet-suavity of the later "Timon" of the Baker collection.The animality and the animal satire, the dynamic and metallic properties, the social satire, on the one hand, the sunlight, the utter cleanness of the Red Duet, are all points in an astounding circumference; which will, until the work is adequately reproduced, have more or less to be taken on trust by the "wider" public.The novel "Tarr" is in print and no one need bother to read my critiques of it. It contains much that Joyce's work does not contain, but differentiations between the two authors are to the detriment of neither, one tries solely to discriminate qualities : hardness, fullness, abun- dance, weight, finish, all terms used sometimes with derogatory and sometimes with laudative intonation, or at any rate valued by one auditor and depreciated byanother.

Dostoievsky, and he is more rapid than/Dostoievsky, his mind travels with greater celerity, with more unexpectedness, but he loses none of Dostoievsky's effect of mass and of weight.* Little Review.?2i6 INSTIGATIONSTarr is a man of genius surrounded by the heavy stu- pidities of the half-cultured latin quarter; the book de- lineates his explosions in this oleaginous milieu; as well as the debacle of the unintelligent emotion-dominated Kreisler. They are the two titanic characters in con- temporary English fiction. Wells's clerks, Bennett's "cards" and even Conrad's Russian villains do not "bulk up" against them.Only in James Joyce's "Stephen Dedalus" does one find an equal intensity, and Joyce is, by comparison, cold and meticulous, where Lewis is, if uncouth, at any rate brim- ming with energy, the man with a leaping mind.Despite its demonstrable faults I do not propose to attack this novel.* It is a serious work, it is definitely an attempt to express, and very largely a success in ex- pressing, something. The "average novel," the average successful commercial proposition at 6s. per 300 to 600 pages is nothing of the sort; it is merely a third-rate mind's imitation of a perfectly well-known type-novel; of let us say Dickens, or Balzac, or Sir A. Conan-Doyle, or Hardy, or Mr. Wells, or Mrs. Ward, or some other and less laudable proto- or necro-type.A certain commercial interest attaches to the sale of these mimicries and a certain purely technical or trade or clique interest may attach to the closeness or "skill" oftheaping,ortothe"application"ofaformula. The "work," the opus, has a purely narcotic value, it serves to soothe the tired mind of the reader, to take said "mind" off its "business" (whether that business be lofty, "intellectual," humanitarian, sordid, acquisitive, or other). There is only one contemporary English work* Egoist, Ltd., 23, Adelphi Terrace House, Robert Street, W. C. 2. 6s. net. Knopf, New York, $1.50.

The appearance of either of these novels would be a recog- nized literary event had it occurred in any other country in Europe.Joyce's novel is a triumph of actual writing. The actual arrangement of the words is worth any author's study. Lewis on the contrary, is, in the actual writing, faulty. His expression is as bad as that of Meredith's floppy sickliness. In place of Meredith's mincing we have something active and "disagreeable." But we have at any rate the percussions of a highly energized mind.In both Joyce and Lewis we have the insistent utter- ance of men who are once for all through with the par- ticular inanities of Shavian-Bennett, and with the par- ticular oleosities of the Wellsian genre.The faults of Mr. Lewis' writing can be examined in the first twenty-five pages. Kreisler is the creation of the book. He is roundly and objectively set before us. Tarr is less clearly detached from his creator. The au- thor has evidently suspected this, for he has felt the need of disclaiming Tarr in a preface.Tarr, like his author, is a man with an energized mind. When Tarr talks at length; when Tarr gets things off his chest, we suspect that the author also is getting them off his own chest. Herein the technique is defective. It is also defective in that it proceeds by general descriptive statements in many cases where the objective presentment of single and definite acts would be more effective, more convincing.It differs from the general descriptiveness of cheap fiction in that these general statements are often a very profound reach for the expression of verity. In brief, the author is trying to get the truth and not merely play-?2i8 INSTIGATIONSing baby-battledore among phrases. When Tarr talks little essays and makes aphorisms they are often of in- trinsicinterest,areevenunforgettable. Likewise,when the author comments upon Tarr, he has the gift of phrase, vivid, biting, pregnant, full of suggestion.The engaging if unpleasant character, Tarr, is placed in an unpleasant milieu, a milieu very vividly "done." The reader retains no doubts concerning the verity and existence of this milieu (Paris or London is no matter, though the scene is, nominally, in Paris). It is the existence where:"Art is the smell of oil paint, Henri Murger's Vie de Boheme, corduroy trousers, the operatic Italian model . . . quarter given up to Art.--Letters and other things are round the corner."... permanent tableaux of the place, disheartening'as a Tussaud's of The Flood."Tarr's first impact is with "Hobson," whose "dastardlyface attempted to portray delicacies of common sense, and gossamer-like back-slidings into the Inane, that would have puzzled a bile-specialist. He would occa- sionally exploit his blackguardly appearance and black- smith's muscles for a short time . . . his strong pierc- ing laugh threw A.B.C. waitresses into confusion."This person wonders if Tarr is a "sound bird." Tarr is not a sound bird. His conversational attack on Hob- son proceeds by a brandishing of false dilemma, but neither Hobson nor his clan, nor indeed any of the critics of the novel (to date) have observed that this is Tarr's faulty weapon. Tarr's contempt for Hobson is as ade- quate as it is justifiable."Hobson, he considered, was a crowd.--You could not say he was an individual.--He was a set. He sat there a cultivated audience.--He had the aplomb and--I?IN THE VORTEX i2i9absence of self-consciousness of number^, of the herd of those who know they are not alone. . . ."For distinguishing feature Hobson possessed a dis- tinguished absence of personality. . . . Hobson was an humble investor."Tarr addresses him with some frankness on the sub- ject:"As an oflF-set for your prying, scurvy way of peeping into my affairs you must offer your own guts, such as theyare.. . ."You have joined yourself to those who hush their voices to hear what other people are saying. . . ."Your plumes are not meant to fly with, but merely to slouch and skip along the surface of the earth.--^You wear the livery of a ridiculous set, you are a cunning and sleek domestic. No thought can come out of your head before it has slipped on its uniform. All your instincts are drugged with a malicious languor, an arm, a respectability, invented by a set of old women and mean, cadaverous little boys."Hobson opened his mouth, had a movement of the body to speak. But he relapsed."You reply, 'What is all this fuss about ? I have done the best for myself.'---I am not suited for any heroic station, like yours. I live sensibly, cultivating my vege- table ideas, and also my roses and Victorian lilies.-- do no harm to anybody.""That is not quite the case. That is a little inexact. Your proceedings possess a herdesque astuteness ; in the scale against the individual weighing less than the Yellow Press, yet being a closer and meaner attack. Also you are essentially spies, in a scurvy, safe and well-paid service, as I told you before. You are disguised to look like the thing it is your function to betray--What is your:individual.and later.".."YouarelibelingtheArtist,byyouridleness." Also, "Your pseudo-neediness is a sentimental indulgence."All this swish and clatter of insult reminds one a little of Papa Karamazoff.

There are probably such Bloomsburys in Paris and in every large city.This sort of catalogue is not well designed to interest the general reader. What matters is the handling, the vigor, even the violence, of the handling.The book's interest is riot due to the "style" in so far as "style" is generally taken to mean "smoothness of finish," orderly arrangement of sentences, coherence to the Flaubertian method.It is due to the fact that we have here a highly-ener- gized mind performing a huge act of scavenging; clean- ing up a great lot of rubbish, cultural, Bohemian, romantico-Tennysonish, arty, societish, gutterish.It is not an attack on the Spicier. It is an attack on a sort of super-^icier desiccation. It is by no means a tract. If Hobson is so drawn as to disgust one with the..?222 INSTIGATIONS"stuffed-shirt," Kreisler is equally a sign-post pointing to the advisability of some sort of intellectual or at least commonsense management of the emotions.Tarr, and even Kreisler, is very nearly justified by the depiction of the Bourgeois Bohemian fustiness: Frau- lein Lippmann, Fraulein Fogs, etc.What we are blessedly free from is the red-plush '^ Wellsianillusionism,andtheclickofMr.Bennett'scash- register finish. The book does not skim over the sur- face. If it does not satisfy the mannequin demand for "beauty" it at least refuses to accept margarine substi- tutes. It will not be praised by Katherine Tynan, nor byMr.ChestertonandMrs.Meynell. Itwillnotreceive / the sanction of Dr. Sir Robertson Nicoll, nor of hisdespicable paper "The Bookman."(There will be perhaps some hope for the Britishreading public, when said paper is no longer to be found in the Public Libraries of the Island, and when Clement Shorter shall cease from animadverting.) "Tarr" does not appeal to these people nor to the audience which they have swaddled. Neither, of course, did Samuel, Butler to their equivalents in past decades."Bertha and Tarr took a flat in the Boulevard Port Royal, not far from the Jardin des Plantes. They gave a party to which Fraulein Lippmann and a good many other people came. He maintained the rule of four to seven, roughly, for Bertha, with the uttennost punctili-ousness. AnastasyaandBerthadidnotmeet. "Bertha's child came, and absorbed her energies for upwards of a year. It bore some resemblance to Tarr. Tarr's afternoon visits became less frequent. He livednow publicly with his illicit and splendid bride."Two years after the birth of the child, Bertha divorced Tarr. She then married an eye-doctor, and?IN THE VORTEX 22?lived with a brooding seveifity in his company, and that of her only child."Tarr and Anastasya did not marry. They had no c&ildren. Tarr, however, had three children by a Lady of the name of Rose Fawdett, who consoled him even- tuallyforthesplendorsofhis'perfectwoman.' Butyet beyond the dim though sordid figure of Rose Fawcett, another rises. This one represents the swing-back of the pendulum once more to the swagger side. The cheerless and stodgy absurdity of Rose Fawcett re- quired the painted, fine and inquiring face of Prism Dirkes."Neither this well-writen conclusion, nor the opening tirade I have quoted, give the full impression of the book's vital quality, but they may perhaps draw the explorative reader."Tarr" finds sex a monstrosity, he finds it "a German study": "Sex, Hobson, is a German study. A German study."At that we may leave it. "Tarr" "had no social ma- chinery, but the cumbrous one of the intellect. . . . When he tried to be amiably he usually only succeeded in being ominous.""Tarr" really gets at something in his last long dis- cussion with Anastasya, when he says that art "has no inside." This is a condition of art, "to have no inside> nothing you cannot see. It is not something impelled like a machine by a little egoistic inside.""Deadness, in the limited sense in which we use that word, is the first condition of. art. The second is absence of soul, in the sentimental human sense. The lines and masses of a statue are its soul."Joyce says something of the sort very differently, he is full of technical scholastic terms : "stasis, kinesis," etc.1/?224 INSTIGATIONSAny careful statement of this sort is bound to be baffoui, and fumbled over, but this ability to come to a hard definition of anything is one of Lewis' qualities lying at the base of his ability to irritate the mediocre intelli- gence. The book was written before 1914, but the de- piction of the German was not a piece of war propa- ganda.AN HISTORICAL ESSAYISTLYTTON STRACHEY ON LEFT-OVER CELEBRITYMr. Strachey, acting as funeral director for a group of bloated reputations, is a welcome addition to the small group of men who continue what Samuel Butler began. ThehowlsgoingupintheTimesLit.Sup.from the descendants of the ossements are but one curl more of incense to the new author.His book is a series of epitomes, even the illustrations, from the peculiar expression of Mr. Gladstone's rascally face to the differently, but equally, peculiar expression of Newman's and the petrified settled fanatic will-to- power in Cardinal Manning's, are epitomes.Whatever else we may be sure of, we may be sure that no age with any intellectual under-pinnings would have made so much fuss over these "figures." For most of us, the odor of defunct Victoriania is so unpleasant and the personal benefits to be derived from a study of the period so small that we are content to leave the past where we find it, or to groan at its leavings as they are, week by week, tossed up in the Conservative papers. The Victorian era is like a stuffy alley-way which we can, for the most part, avoid. We do not agitate for its?IN THE VORTEX 225destruction, because it does not greatly concern us; at least, we have no feeling of responsibility, we are glad to have moved on toward the open, or at least toward the patescent, or to have found solace in the classics or in eighteenth century liberations.Mr. Strachey, with perhaps the onus of feeling that the "Spectator" was somewhere in his immediate family, has been driven into patient exposition. The heavy gas of the past decades cannot be dispersed by mere "BLASTS" and explosions. Mr. Strachey has under- taken a chemical dispersal of residues.At the age of nine Manning devoured the Apocalypse. He read Paley at Harrow, and he never got over it. Impeded in a political career, he was told that the King- domofHeavenwasopentohim. "Heavenlyambitions" were suggested. The "Oxford Movement" was, in a minor way, almost as bad as the Italian Counter- Reformation. Zeal was prized more than experience. Manning was the child of his age, the enfant prodigue of it, who could take advantage of all its blessings. A fury of "religion" appears to have blazed through the period. This fury must be carefully distinguished from theology, which latter is an elaborate intellectual exer- cise, and can in its finest developnients be used for sharpening the wits, developing the rational faculties {vide Aquinas). Theology, straying from the en- closures of religion, enters the purlieus of philosophy, and in some cases exacts stiff definitions.Froude, Newman and Keble were part of an unfor- tunate retrogression, or, as Mr. Strachey has written, "Christianity had become entangled in a series of un- fortunate circumstances from which it was the plain duty of Newman and his friends to rescue it." Keble de- sired an England "more superstitious, more bigoted.?226 INSTIGATIONSmore gloomy, more fierce in its religion." Tracts for tlie Times were published. Pusey imagined that people practised fasting. It was a curious period. One should take it at length from Mr. Strachey.The contemporary mind may well fail to note a dif- ference between these retrogradists and the earlier nuisance John Calvin, who conceived the floors of hell paved with unbaptized infants half a span long. Mr. Strachey's patient exposition will put them right in the matter.We have forgotten how bad it was, the ideas of the Oxford movement have faded out of our class, or at least the free moving men of letters meet no one still em- bedded in these left-overs. Intent on some system of thought interesting to themselves and their friends, they "lose touch with the public." And the "public," as soon as it is of any size, is full of these left-overs, full of the taste of F. T. Palgrave, of Keble's and Pusey's religion.To ascertain the under-side of popular opinion, or I had better say popular assumption, one may do worse than read books of a period just old enough to appear intolerable.(For example, if you wish to understand tlie taste displayed in the official literature of the last administra- tion you must read anthologies printed between 1785 and 1837.)Mr. Strachey's study of Manning is particularly valu- able in a time when people still persist in not under- standing the Papal church as a political organization ex- ploitingareligion; itsforce,doubtless,hascome,through the centuries, from men like Manning, balked in political careers, suffering from a "complex" of power-lust.Among Strachey's "Eminent" we find one common characteristic, a sort of mulish persistence in any course,?IN THE VORTEX 227however stupid. One might , develop the proposition that Nietzsche in his will-to-power "philosophy" was no more than the sentimental, inefficient German of the "old type" expressing an idolization of the British Vic- torian character.Still it is hard to see how any people save those chr liaiino perduto il hen del intellettocould have swallowed such shell-game propositions as those of Manning's, quoted on p. 08. concerning response to prayer.The next essay is a very different matter. Mr. .Strachey, without abandoning the acridity of his style, exposes Florence Nightingale as a great constructor of civilization. Her achievement remains, early victim of Christian voodooism, surrounded mainly by cads and imbeciles, it is a wonder her temper was not a great deal worse. She may well be pardoned a few hysterias, a few metaphysical bees in her cap. Even in meta- physics, if she was unable to improve on Confucius and Epicurus, she seems to have been quite as intelligent as many of her celebrated contemporaries who had no more solid basis for reputation than their "philosophic" writing. Our author has so branded Lord Stratford de Redcliffe and the physican Hall that no amount of apologiawillreinstatethem. Panmureisleftasagoose, and Hawes as a goose with a touch of malevolence.Queen \'ictoria appears several times in this essay, and effectively:" 'It will be a very great satisfaction to me,' Her Majesty added, 'to make the acquaintance of one who has set so bright an example to our sex.""The brooch, which was designed by the Prince Con-"?228 WSTIGATIONSsort, bore a St. George's cross in red enamel, and the Royalcyphersurmountedbydiamonds. Thewholewas encircled by the inscription, 'Blessed are the Merciful.'Dr. Arnold of Rugby, to be as brief as possible with a none too pleasant subject, "substituted character for intellect in the training of British youth."The nineteenth century had a "letch" for unifications, it believed that, in general, "all is one"; when this doc- trine failed of a sort of pragmatic sanction in rem, it tried to reduce things to the least possible number. True, in the physical world, it did not attempt to use steam and dynamite interchangeably, but, in affairs of the mind, such was the indubitable tendency.It is, however, a folly to "substitute" character for intelligence and one would rather have been at the Grammar-School of Ashford, in Kent, in 1759, under Stephen Barrett, A.M., than at Rugby, in 1830, under Dr. Arnold, or, later, under any of his successors. And I give thanks to Zeusocns tot' ialv, that being an Ameri- can, I have escaped the British public school. Mrs. Ward is at liberty to write to the Times as much as she likes, I do not envy her Dr. Arnold for grandfather.Arnold stands pre-eminent as an "educator," and from him the term has gradually taken its present meaning: "a man with no intellectual interests."Mr. Strachey completes his volume with a study of that extraordinarycrank.GeneralGordon. Ittakeshimtwo lines to blast the reputation of Lord Elgin. He does it quietly, but Elgin's name will stink in the memory of the reader. It is difficult to attribute this wholly to the author, for the facts are in connivance with him. But if his irony at times descends to sarcasm, one must balance that with the general quietude of his style. One canbuthopethatthisbookwillnotbehislast; onewould?IN THE VORTEX 229welcome a treatment, by him, of The Members of the British Academic Committee, British Publishers, The Asquith Administration.The religion of Tien Wang mentioned on p. 221 ap- pears to have been as intelligent as any other form of Christianity, and to have had much the same active ef- fects. However, Gordon was appointed to oppose it. Throughout the rest of his life he seems to have been obsessed by the curious medijeval fallacy that the world is vanity and the body but ashes and dust. He fell vic- tim to the exaggerated monotheism of his era. But he'had the sense to follow his instinct in a period when instincts were not thought quite respectable; this made him an historic figure; it also must have lent him great charm (with perhaps rather picturesque drawbacks). This valuable quality, charm, must have been singularly lacking in Mr. Gladstone.It is, indeed, difficult to restrain one's growing con- viction that Mr. Gladstone was not all his party had hoped for. Gordon was "difficult," at the time of his last expedition he was perhaps little better than a lunatic, but Gladstone was decidedly unpleasant.In all of the eminent was the quality of a singularly uncritical era. It was a time when a prominent man could iorm himself on a single volume handed to him by "tradition"; when illiteracy, in the profounder sense of that term, was no drawback to a vast public career. (An era, of course, happily closed.)I do not know that there is much use enquiring into the causes of the Victorian era, or any good to be got from speculations. Its disease might seem to have been an aggravated form of provincialism. ^Professor Sir Henry Newbolt has recently pointed out that the English?230 INSTIGATIONSpublic is "interested in politics rather than literature"; this may be a lingering symptom.If one sought, not perhaps to exonerate, but to explain the Victorian era one might find some contributory cause in Napoleon. That is to say, the Napoleonic wars had made Europe unpleasant, England was sensibly glad to be insular. Geography leaked over into mentality. Eighteenth century thought had indeed got rid of the Bourbons, but later events had shown that eighteenth century thought might be dangerous. England cut off herintellectualcommunicationswiththeContinent. An eraofbigotrysupervened. Wehavesothoroughlyfor- gotten, if we ever knew, the mental conditions preced- ing the Victorian era, save perhaps as they appear in the scribblings of, let us say, Lady Blessington, that we cannot tell whether the mentality of the Victorian reign was an advance or an appalling retrogression.

STREETThere was in the nineties, the late nineties and dur- ing the early years of this century, and still is, a writer named George S. Street. He has written some of the best things that have been' thought concerning Lord Byron, he has written them not as a romanticist, not as a Presbyterian, but as a man of good sense. They are worthy of commendation. He has written charm- ingly in criticism of eighteenth century writers, and of the ghosts of an earlier Piccadilly. He has written tales of contemporary life with a suavity, wherefrom the present writer at least has learned a good deal, even if he has not yet put it into scriptorial practice. (I haste to state this indebtedness.)The writers of moeurs contemporaines are so few, or rather there are so few of them who can be treated under the heading "literature," that the discovery or circula- tion of any such writer is no mean critical action. Mr. Street is "quite as amusing as Stockton," with the infinite difference that Mr. Street has made literature. Essays upon him are not infrequent in volumes of English essays dealing with contemporary authors. My impres- sion is that he is not widely read in America (his pub- lishers will doubtless put me right if this impression is erroneous) ; I can only conclude that the possession of a style, the use of a suave and pellucid English has erected some sort of barrier."The Trials of the Bantocks," "The Wise and the Wayward," "The Ghosts of Piccadilly," "Books of Essays," "The Autobiography of a Boy," "Quales Ego,"?232 INSTIGATIONS"Miniatures and Moods," are among his works, and in them the rare but intelligent reader may take refuge from the imbecilities of the multitude.FREDERIC MANNINGIn 1910 Mr. Manning published, with the almost de- funct and wholly uncommendable firm of John Murray, "Scenes and Portraits," the opening paragraph of which I can still, I believe, quote from memory."When Merodach, King of Uruk, sat down to his meals, he made his enemies his footstool, for be- neath his table he kept an hundred kings with their thumbs and great toes cut off, as signs of his power andclemency. WhenMerodachhadfinishedeating he shook the crumbs from his napkin, and the kings fed themselves with two fingers, and when Merodach observed how painful and difficult this operation was, he praised God for having given thumbs to man." 'It is by the absence of things,' he said, 'that we learn their use. Thus if we deprive a man of his eyes we deprive him of sight, and in this man- ner we learn that sight is the function of the eyes.'"Thus spake Merodach, for he had a scientific mind and was curious of God's handiwork. And when he had finished speaking, his courtiers ap- plauded him."Adam is afterwards discovered trespassing in Mero- dach's garden or paradise. The characters of Bagoas, Merodach's high priest, Adam, Eve and the Princess Candace are all admirably presented. The book is divided in six parts: the incident of the Kingdom of?IN THE VORTEX 233Uruk, a conversation at the house of Euripides, "A Friend of Paul," a conversation between St. Francis and the Pope, another between Thomas Cromwell and Macchiavelli, and a final encounter between Leo XIII and Renan in Paradise.This book is not to be neglected by the intelligent reader (avis rarissima, and in what minute ratio to the population I am still unable to discern)."Others" Anthology for 1917. This last gives, I think, the first adequate presentation of Mina Loy and Marianne Moore, who have, without exaggerated '"nationalism," without waving of banners and general phrases about Columbia gem of the ocean, succeeded in, or fallen into, producing something distinctly American in quality, not merely distinguishable as American by reason of current national faults.Their work is neither simple, sensuous nor passionate, but as we are no longer governed by the North American Review we need not condemn poems merely because they do not fit some stock phrase or rhetorical criticism.(For example, an infinitely greater artist than Tenny- son uses six "s's" and one "z" in a single line. It is one of the most musical lines in Provencal and opens a poem especiallycommendedbyDante. Letusleavetherealm of promoted typists who quote the stock phrases of text-books.)In the verse of Marianne Moore I detect traces of emotion; inthatofMinaLoyIdetectnoemotionwhat- ever. Both of these women are, possibly in unconscious- ness, among the. followers of Jules Laforgue (whose work shows a great deal of emotion) . Or perhaps Rene Ghil is the "influence" in Miss Moore's case. It is pos- sible, as I have written, or intended to write elsewhere, to?234 INSTIGATIONSdivide poetry into three sorts: (i) melopoeia, to wit, poetry whicfi moves by its music, whether it be a music in words or an aptitude for, or suggestion of, accom- panying music; (2) imagism, or poetry wherein the feelings of painting and sculpture- are predominant (cer- tain men move in phantasmagoria; the images of their gods, whole countrysides, stretches of hill land and forest, travel with them) ; and there is, thirdly, logopoeia, or poetry that is akin to nothing but language which is a dance of the intelligence among words and ideas and modifications of ideas and characters. Pope and the eighteenth-century writers had in this medium a certain limitedrange. TheintelligenceofLaforgueranthrough the whole gamut of his time. T. S. Eliot has gone on with it. Browning wrote a condensed form of drama, full of things of the senses, scarcely ever pure logopoeia.One wonders what the devil any one will make of this sort of thing who has not in their wit all the clues. It has none of the stupidity beloved of the "lyric" en- thusiast, and the writer and reader who take refuge in scenery, description of nature, because they are unable to cope with the human. These two contributors to the "Others" Anthology write logopoeia. It is, in their case, the utterance of clever people in despair, or hover- ing upon the brink of that precipice. It is of those who have acceded with Renan "La betise humain6 est la seule chose qui donne une idee de I'infini." It is a mind cry, more than a heart cry. "Take the world if thou wilt but leave me an asylum for my affection," is not their lamentation, but rather "In the midst of this desolation, give me at least one intelligence to converse with."The arid clarity, not without its own beauty, of le temperament de I'Americaine, is in the poems of these, I think, graduates or post-graduates. If they have not?IN THE VORTEX 235received B.A.'s or M.A.'s or B.Sc.'s they do not need them.The point of my praise, for I intend this as praise, even if I do not burst into the phrases of Victor Hugo, is that without any pretences and without clamors about nationality, these girls have written a distinctly national product, they have written something which would not have come out of any other country, and (while I have before now seen a deal of rubbish by both of them) they are, as selected by Mr. Kreymborg, interesting and readable (by me, that is. I am aware that even the poems before me would drive numerous not wholly un- intelligent readers into a fury of rage-out-of-puzzle-ment.) Both these poetriae have said a number of things not to be found in the current numbers of Every- body's,theCenturyorMcClure's. "TheEffectualMar- riage," "French Peacock," "My Apish Cousins," have each in its way given me pleasure. Miss Moore has already prewritten her cbunterblast to my criticism in her poem "to a Steam Roller."The anthology displays also Mr. Williams' praise- worthy opacity.THE NEW POETRYEnglish and French literature have stood in constant need of each other, and it is interesting to note, as con- current but in no way dependent upon the present alli- ance, a new French vitality among our younger writers of poetry. As some of these latter are too new to presuppose the reader's familiarity with them, I quote a few poems before venturing to open a discussion. T. S. Eliot is the most finished, the most composed of these poets; kt us observe his poem "The Hippopota- mus," as it appears in The Little Review.--.?236INSTIGATIONS The HippopotamusThe broad backed hippopotamus Rests on his belly in the mud; Although he seems so firm to us. ., . Yet he is merely flesh and blood.Flesh-and-blood is weak and frail, Susceptible to nervous shock; While the True Qiurch can never fail For it is based upon a rock.The hippo's feeble steps may errIn compassing material ends,While the True Church need never stir To gather in its dividends.The potamus can never reachThe mango on the mango-tree,But fruits of pomegranate and peach Refresh the Church from over sea.At mating time the hippo's voice Betrays inflexions hoarse and odd. But every week we hear rejoice The Church, at being one with God.The hippopotamus's dayIs past in sleep; at night he hunts; God works in a mysterious wayThe Church can sleep and feed at once?IN THE VORTEX 237I saw the potamus take wing Ascending from the damp savannas, And quiring angels round him sing The praise of God, in loud hosannas.Blood of the Lamb shall wash him clean And him shall heavenly arms enfold, Among the saints he shall be seen Performing on a harp of gold.He shall be washed as white as snow, By all the martyr'd virgins kist. While the True Church remains below Wrapt in the old miasmal mist.This cold sardonic statement is definitely of the school of Theophile Gautier; as definitely as Eliot's "Conversa- tion Galante" is in the manner of Jules Laforgue. There is a great deal in the rest of Mr. Eliot's poetry which is personal, and in no wise derivative either from the French or from Webster and Tourneur just as there;is in "The Hippopotamus" a great deal which is not Theophile Gautier. I quote the two present poems sim- ply to emphasize a certain lineage and certain French virtues and qualities, which are, to put it most mildly, a great and blessed relief after the official dullness and Wordsworthian lignification of the "Georgian" Antholo- gies and their descendants and derivatives as upheld by The New Statesman, that nadir of the planet of hebe- tude, that apogee of the kulturesque.Conversation Galante*I observe: "Our sentimental friend the moon! Or possibly (fantastic, I confess)From "Prufrock." By T. S. Eliot. Egoist, Ltd.--!?238INSTIGATIONSIt may be Prester John's balloonOr an old battered lantern hung aloftTo light poor travelers to their distress."She then: "How you digress!"And I then: "Some one frames upon the keys That exquisite nocturne, with which we explain The night and moonshine, music which we seize To body forth our own vacuity."She then: "Does this refer to me?" "Oh no, it is I who am inane.""You, madam, are the eternal humorist.The eternal enemy of the absolute.Giving our vagrant moods the slightest twist With your air indifferent and imperiousAt a stroke our mad poetics to confute And----: "Are we then so serious?""Laforgue's influehce or Ghil's or some kindred ten- dency is present in the whimsicalities of Marianne Moore, and of Mina Loy. A verbalism less finished than Eliot's appears in Miss Moore's verses calledPedantic LiteralistPrince Rupert's drop, paper muslin ghost. White torch "with power to say unkindThings with kindness and the most Irritating things in the midst of love andTears," you invite destruction.You are like the meditative man With the perfunctory heart; its?IN THE VORTEX239Carved cordiality ranTo and fro at first, like an inlaid and royalImmutable production;Then afterward "neglected to be Painful" and "deluded him withLoitering formality,Doing its duty as if it did not,"Presenting an obstructionTo the motive that it served. What stood Erectinyouhaswithered. ALittle "palmtree of turned wood"Informs your once spontaneous core in itsImmutable reduction.The reader accustomed only to glutinous imitations of Keats, diaphanous dilutations of Shelley, woolly Wordsworthian paraphrases, or swishful Swinburniania will doubtless dart back appalled by Miss Moore's de- partures from custom; custom, that is, as the male or female devotee of Palgravian insularity understands that highlyelasticterm. ThePalgravianwillthenwithdis- appointment discover that his favorite and conventional whine is inapplicable. Miss Moore "rhymes in places." Her versification does not fit in with preconceived notions of vers litre. It possesses a strophic structure. The elderly Newboltian groans. The all-wool un- bleachedGeorgiansighsominously. Anotherauthorhas been reading French poets, and using words for the communication of thought. Alas, times will not stay anchored.Mina Loy has been equally subject to something like internationalinfluence; therearelinesinher"Ineffectual--?240 INSTIGATIONSMarriage" perhaps better written than anything I have found in Miss Moore, as, for example:"So here we might dispense with her Gina being a femaleBut she was more than thatBeing an incipience a correlative an instigation to the reaction of man From the palpable to the transcendent Mollescent irritant of his fantasyGina had her use Being useful contentedly consciousShe flowered in EmpyreanFrom which no well-mated woman ever returnsSundays a warm light in the parlor From the gritty road on the white wall anybody could see itShimmered a composite effigyMadonna crinolined a man hidden beneath her hoop.Patience said Gina is an attribute >> And she learned at any hour to offer The dish appropriately delectableWhat had Miovanni made of his egoIn his libraryWhat had Gina wondered among the pots andpansOne never asked the other."?IN THE VORTEX 241These lines are not written as Henry Davray said re- cently in the "Mercure de France," that the last "Geor- gian Anthology" poems are written, i.e., in search for "sentiments pour les accommoder a leur vocabulaire." Miss Loy's are distinctly the opposite, they are words set down to convey a definite meaning, and words accom- modated to that meaning, even if they do not copy the mannerisms of the five or six by no means impeccable nineteenth century poets whom the British Poetry Society has decided to imitate.All this is very pleasing, or very displeasing, accord- ing to the taste of the reader; according to his freedom from, or his bondage to, custom.Distinct and as different as possible from the orderly statements of Eliot, and from the slightly acid whimsi- calities of these ladies, are the poems of Carlos Williams. If the sinuosities and mental quirks of Misses Moore and Loy are difficult to follow I do not know what is to be said for , some of Mr. Williams' ramifications and abruptnesses. I do not pretend to follow all of his volts, jerks, sulks, balks, outblurts and jump-overs; but for .all his roughness there remains with me the con- viction that there is nothing meaningless in his book, "Al que quiere," not a line. There is whimsicality as we found it in his earlier poems. "The Tempers" (pub- lished by Elkin Mathews), in the verse to "The Coro-ner's Children," for example. There is distinctness and color, as was shown in his "Postlude," in "Des Im- agistes" ; but there is beyond these qualities the absolute conviction of a man with his feet on the soil, on a soil personally and peculiarly his own. He is rooted. He is at times almost inarticulate, but he is never dry, never without sap in abundance. His course 'may be well indicated by the change of the last few years ; we found--?242 INSTIGATIONShim six years ago in "The Postlude," full of a thick and opaque color, full of emotional richness, with a maxi- mum of subjective reality:POSTLXTOENow that I have cooled to youLet there be gold of tarnished masonry. Temples soothed by the sun to ruin That sleep utterly.Give me hand for the dances,Ripples at Philse, in and out.And lips, my Lesbian,Wall flowers that once were flame.Your hair is my Carthage And my arms the bow.And our words the arrows To shoot the stars.Who from that misty sea Swarm to destroy us.But you there beside me^Oh ! how shall I defy you.Who wound me in the nightWith breasts shining like Venus and like Mars ? The night that is shouting JasonWhen the loud eaves rattle As with waves above me. Blue at the prow of my desire.O prayers in the dark! O incense to Poseidon! Calm in Atlantis.----?IN THE VORTEX343^xora this he has, as some would say, "turned" to a sort of maximum objective reality inThe Old MenOld men who have studied every leg showin the cityOld men cut from touch by the perfumed music polished or fleeced skulls that stand beforethe whole theatrein silent attitudesof attention,old men who have taken precedence over young menand even over dark-faced husbands whose mindsare a street with' arc-lights. Solitary old menfor whom we find no excuses .. .This is less savage than "Les Assis." His "Portrait of a Woman in Bed" incites me to a comparison with Rimbaud's picture of an old actress in her "loge." Not to Rimbaud's disadvantage. I don't know that any, save the wholly initiated into the cult of anti-exoticism, would take Williams' poem for an exotic, but there isno accounting for what may occur in such cases.

'It conveys more than two dozen or two hundred magazine stories about the comedy of slum-work. As the memoir of a physician, it is keener than Spiess' notes of an advocate in the Genevan law courts. It is more compact than Vildrac's "Auberge," and has not Vildrac's tendency to?246 INSTIGATIONSsentiment. It is a poem that could be translated into French or any other modern language and hold its own with the contemporary product of whatever country one chose.A PISTINCTIONA journalist has said to me : "We, i.e. we journalists, are like mediums. People go to a spiritist seance and hear what they want to hear. It is the same with a leading article: we write so that the reader will find what he wants to find."That is the root of the matter ; there is good journal- ism and bad journalism, and journalism that "looks" like "literature" and literature etc. . . .But the root of the difference is that in journalism the reader finds what he is looking for, whereas in liter- ature he must find at least a part of what the author intended.That is why "the first impression of a work of genius" is "nearly always disagreeable." The public loathe the violence done to their self-conceit whenever any one conveys to them an idea that is his, not their own.This difference is lasting and profound. Even in the vaguest of poetry, or the vaguest music, where the re- ceiver may, or must make half the beauty he is to receive, there is alin^ys something of the author or composer which must be transmitted.In journalism or the "bad art," there is no such strain on the public.THE CLASSICS "ESCAPE"It is well that the citizen should be acquainted with thelawsofhiscountry. Inearliertimesthelawsofa?IN THE VORTEX 247nation were graven upon tablets and set up in the market place. I myself have seen a sign: "Bohemians are not permitted within the precincts of this commune"; but the laws of a great republic are too complex and arcane topermitofthissimpletreatment. Iconfesstohaving been a bad citizen, to just the extent of having been ignorant that at any moment my works might be classed in law's eye with the inventions of the late Dr. Condom.It is possible that others with only a mild interest in literature may be equally ignorant ; I quote therefore the law:Section 211 of the United States Criminal Code pro- vides :"Every obscene, lewd, or lascivious, and every filthy book, pamphlet, picture, paper, letter, writing, print, or other publication of an indecent character and every arti- cle or thing designed, adapted, or intended for preventing conception or producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral use; and every article, instrument, substance, drug, medicine, or thing which is advertised or described in a manner calculated to lead another to use or apply it for preventing conception or producing abortion, or for any indecent or immoral purpose ; and every written or printed card, letter, circular, book, pamphlet, adver- tisement, or notice of any kind giving information directly or indirectly, where, or how, or from whom, or by what means any of the hereinbeforementioned mat- ters, articles, or things may be obtained or made, or where or by whom any act or operation of any kind for the procuring or producing of abortion will be done or performed, or how or by what means conception may be prevented or abortion produced, whether sealed or un- sealed; and every letter, packet, or package, or other?248INSTIGATIONS/mail matter containing any filthy, vile or indecent thing, device, or substance; any and every paper, writing, ad- vertisement, or representation that any article, instru- ment, substance, drug, medicine, or thing may, or can, be used or applied for preventing conception or producing abortion or for any indecent or immoral purpose; and every description calculated to induce or incite a person to so use or apply any such article, instrument, sub- stance, drug, medicine, or thing, is hereby declared to be non-mailable matter and shall not be conveyed in the mails or delivered from any post-office or by any letter carrier. Whoever shall knowingly deposit, or cause to be deposited for mailing or delivery, anything declared by this section to be non-mailable, or shall knowingly take, or cause the same to be taken, from the mails for the purpose of circulating or disposing thereof, or of aiding in the circulation or disposition thereof, shall be fined not more than five thousand dollars, or imprisoned not more than five years, or both."It is well that the citizens of a country should be aware of its laws.It is not for me to promulgate obiter dicta ; to say that whatever the cloudiness of its phrasing, this law was obviously designed to prevent the circulation of immoral advertisements, propaganda for secret cures, and slips of paper that are part of the bawdy house business; that it was not designed to prevent the mailing of Dante, Villon, and Catullus. Whatever the subjective attitude of the framers of this legislation, we have fortunately a decision from a learned judge to guide us in its working."I have little doubt that numerous really great writ- ings would come under the ban if tests that are fre- quently current were applied, and these approved pub- lications doubtless at times escape only because they:?IN THE VORTEX 249come within the term "classics," which means, for the purpose of the application of the statute, that they are ordinarily immune from interference, because they have the sanction of age and fame and USUALLY APPEAL TO A COMPARATIVELY LIMITED NUMBER OF READERS."The capitals are my own.The gentle reader will picture to himself the state of America IF the classics were widely read; IF these books which in the beginning lifted mankind from sav- agery, and which from A. D. 1400 onward have gradually redeemed us from the darkness of medievalism, shouldbe read by the millions who now consume Mr. Hearst and the Ladies' Home Journal! ! ! ! ! !Also there are to be no additions. No living man is to contribute or to attempt to contribute to the classics. Obviously even though he acquire fame before publish- ing, he can not have the sanction of "age."Our literature does not fall under an inquisition; it does not bow to an index arranged by a council. It is subject to the taste of one individual.Our hundred and twenty millions of inhabitants desire their literature sifted for them by one individual selected without any examination of his literary qualificatons.I can not write of this thing in heat. It is a far too serious matter.Theclassics"escape." Theyare"immune""ordinar- ily." I can but close with the cadences of that blessed little Brother of Christ, San Francesco d'Assisi!?250        INSTIGATIONSCANTICO DEL SOLEThe thought of what America would be like If the classics had a wide circulationTroubles my sleep, The thought of what America, The thought of what America,The thought of what America would be like If the classics had a wide circulationTroubles my sleep,Nunc dimittis.

The screech-owls from the jungle could only look out upon the shadowed parts of the sea, which they did without optic inconvenience, so deep was the obscured contagionof their afforested blackness.The two extraneous princes went up toward the stable-yard, gaped at the effulgence of peacocks, glared at the derisive gestures of the horse-cleaners, adumbrated in- sults, sought vainly for a footman or any one to take up their cards.The tetrarch appeared on a terrace, removing his cere- monial gloves.The water, sprinkled in the streets in anticipation of the day's parade, dried in little circles of dust. The253             INSTIGATIONStetrarch puffed at his hookah with an exaggeration of dignity; he was disturbed at the presence of princes, he was disturbed by the presence of Jao; he desired to observe his own ruin, the slow deHquescence of his posi- tion, with a fitting detachment and lassitude. Jao had distributed pamphlets, the language was incomprehen- sible; Jaohadbeenstoredinthecellarage,hisfollowing distributed pamphlets.In the twentieth century of his era the house of Emer- aud Archytypas was about to have its prize bit of fire- works: a war with the other world . . . after so many ages of purely esoteric cultureJao had declined both the poisoned coffee and the sacred sword of the Samurai, courtesies offered, in this case, to an incomprehensible foreigner. Even now, with a superlation of form, the sacred kriss had been sent to the court executioner, it was no mere eveiy-day imple- ment. The princejs arrived {at this juncture. There sounded from the back alleys the preparatory chirping of choral societies, and the wailing of pink-lemonade sellers. To-morrow the galley would be gone.Leaning over the syrupy clematis, Emeraud crumbled brioches for the fishes, reminding himself that he had not yet collected the remains of his wits. There was no galvanization known to art, science, industry or the ministrations of sister-souls that would rouse his long since respectable carcass.Yet at his birth a great tempest had burst above the dynastic manor; credible persons had noticed the light- nings scrolling Alpha and Omega above it; and nothing had happened. He had given up flagellation. He walked daily to the family necropolis : a cool place in the summer. HesummonedtheArrangerofInanities.254!?;?OUR TETRARCHAL PRECIEUSE 255 IIStrapped, pomaded, gloved, laced; with patulous beards, with their hair parted at the backs of their heads with their cork-screw curls pulled back from their fore- heads to give themselves tone on their medallions; with helmets against one hip ; twirling the musk-balls of their sabres with their disengaged restless fingers, the hyper- borean royalties were admitted. And the great peoplereceived them, in due order: chief mandarins in clump, the librarian of the palace (Conde de las Navas), the Arbiter Elegantium, the Curator major of Symbols, the Examiner of the High Schools, the Supernumerary priest of the Snow Cult, the Administrator of Death, and the Chief Attendant Collector of Death-duties.Their Highnesses bowed and addressed the Tetrarch: ". . . felicitous wind . . . day so excessively glorious . . .wafted . . . these isles . . . notwithstanding not also whereof . . . basilica far exceeding .. . . Ind, Ormus . . . Miltonesco . . . etc. ... to say nothing of the seven-stopped barbary organ and the Tedium lauda- mus. . . etc.. . ."(Lunch was brought in.)Kallipagous artichokes, a light collation of tunny-fish,asparagus served 011 pink reeds, eels pearl-gray and dove- gray, gamut and series of compotes and various wines (without alcohol).Under impulsion of the Arranger of Inanities the pomaded princes next began their inspection of the build- ings. A pneumatic lift hove them upward to the outer rooms of Salome's suite. The lift door clicked on its gilt-brass double expansion-clamps; the procession ad- vanced between rows of wall-facing negresses whose naked shoulder-blades shone like a bronze of oily opacity.^?256 INSTIGATIONSThey entered the hall of majolica, very yellow with thick blue incrustations, glazed images, with flushed and pro- tuberant faces; in the third atrium they came upon a basin of joined ivory, a white bath-sponge, rather large, a pair of very pink slippers. The next room was littered with books bound in white vellum and pink satin; the next with mathematical instruments, hydrostats, sextants, astrolabial discs, the model of a gasolene motor, a nickel- plated donkey engine. . . . They proceeded up metal stairs to the balcony, from which a rustling and swaying and melodiously enmousselined figure, jonquil-colored and delicate, preceded or rather predescended them by dumb-waiter, a route which they were not ready to fol- low. The machine worked for five floors : usage private and not ceremonial.The pomaded princes stood to attention, bowed with deference and with gallantry. The Arranger ignored the whole incident, ascended the next flight of stairs and began on the telescope:"^Grand equatorial, 22 yards inner tube length, revolv- able cupola (frescoes in water-tight paint) weight 200,089 kilos, circulating on fourteen steel castors in a groove of chloride of magnesium, 2 minutes for com- plete revolution. The princess can turn it herself."The princes allowed their attention to wander, they noted their ship beneath in the harbor, and calculated the drop, they then compared themselves with the bro- caded and depilated denizens of the escort, after which they felt safer. They were led passively into the Small Hall of Perfumes, presented with protochlorine of mer- cury, bismuth regenerators, cantharides, lustral waters guaranteed free from hydrated lead. Were conducted thence to the hanging garden, where the form her- metically enmousselined, the jonquil-colored gauze with?OUR TETRARCHAL PRECIEUSE257the pea-sized dark spots on it, disappeared from the opposite slope. Molossian hounds yapping and romping about her.The trees lifted their skinned-salmon trunks, the heavy blacknesswasbrokenwithasteely,metallicsunshine. A sea wind purred through the elongated forest like an express-train in a tunnel. Polychrome statues obtruded themselves from odd corners. An elephant swayed ab- sentmindedly, the zoo was loose all over the place. The keeper of the aquarium moralized for an hour upon the calm life of his fishes. From beneath the dark tanks the hareem sent up a decomposed odor, and a melancholy slave chantey saturated the corridors, a low droning osmosis. They advanced to the cemetery, wanting all the time to see Jao.This exhibit came at last in its turn. They were let down in a sling-rope through a musty nitrated grill, ob- serving in this descent the ill-starred European in his bath-robe, his nose in a great fatras of papers over- scrawled with illegible pot-hooks.He rose at their hefty salutation; readjusted his spec- tacles, blinked ; and then it came over him : These damn pustulent princes! Here! and at last! Memory over- whelmed him. How many, on how many rotten De- cember and November evenings had he stopped, had he not stopped in the drizzle, in the front line of workmen, his nose crushed against a policeman, and craning his scraggy neck to see them getting out of their state ba- rouche, going up the interminable front stairway to thebig-windowed rococo palace ; he muttering that the "Times" were at hand.Andnowtherevolutionwasaccomplished. Theprole- tariat had deputed them. They were here to howk him out of quod ; a magnificent action, a grace of royal?258 INSTIGATIONShumility, performed at tlie will of the people, the new era had come into being. He saluted them automatically, searching for some phrase European, historic, fraternal, of course, but still noble.The Royal Nephew, an oldish military man with a bald-spot, ubiquitarian humorist, joking with every one in season and out (like Napoleon), hating all doctri- naires (like Napoleon), was however the first to break silence: "Huk, heh, old sour bean, bastard of Jean Jacques Rousseau, is this where you've come to be hanged ? Eh ? I'm damned if it ain't a good thing."The unfortunate publicist stiffened."Idealogue!" said the Nephew.The general strike had been unsuccessful. Jao bentwith emotion. Tears showed in his watery eyes, slid down his worn cheek, trickled into his scraggy beard. There was then a sudden change in his attitude. He began to murmur caresses in the gentlest of European diminutives.They started. There was a tinkle of keys, and through a small opposite doorway they discerned the last flash of the mousseline, the pale, jonquil-colored, blackspotted.The Nephew readjusted his collar. A subdued cortege reascended.IllThe ivory orchestra lost itself in gay fatalistic impro- visation ; the opulence of two hundred over-fed tetrarchal Dining-Companions swished in the Evening salon, and overflowedcoruscatedcouches. Theyslitheredthrough their genuflections to the throne. The princes puffed out their elbows, simultaneously attempting to disentangle their Collars-of-the-Fleece in the idea that these would;?OUR TETRARCHAL PRECIEUSE 259be a suitable present for their entertainer. Neither suc- ceeded ; suddenly in the midst of the so elaborate setting they perceived the aesthetic nullity of the ornament, its connotations were too complex to go into.The tetrarchal children (superb productions, in the strictly esoteric sense) were led in over the jonquil-col- oredreed-matting. Awater-jetshotupfromthecentre of the great table, and fell plashing above on the red and white rubber awning. A worn entertainment beset the diminutive music-hall stage: acrobats, flower-dancers, contortionists, comic wrestlers, to save the guests con- versation. A trick skater was brought in on real ice, did the split, engraved a gothic cathedral. The Virgin Ser- pent as she was called, entered singing "Biblis, Biblis"; she was followed by a symbolic Mask of the Graces which gave place to trapeze virtuosi.An horizontal geyser of petals was shot over the audi- torium. The hookahs were brought in. Jao presumably heard all this over his head. The diners' talk became general, the princes supporting the army, authority, re- ligion a bulwark of the state, international arbitration, the perfectibility of the race; the mandarins of the pal- ace held for the neutrahzation of contacts, initiated cen- acles, frugality and segregation.The music alone carried on the esoteric undertone, si- lencespreadwithgreatfeathers,poisedhawk-wise. Sa- lome appeared on the high landing, descended the twisted stair,stillstiffinhersheathofmousseline; asmallebony lyre dangled by a gilt cord from her wrist; she nodded toherparent; pausedbeforetheAlcazarcurtain,balanc- ing, swaying on her anaemic pigeon-toed little feet--until every one had had a good look at her. She looked at no one in particular; her hair dusty with exiguous pollens curled down over her narrow shoulders, ruffled over her:?26o INSTIGATIONSforehead, with stems of yellow flowers twisted into it. From the dorsal joist of her bodice, from a sort of pearl matrix socket there rose a peacock tail, moire, azure, glittering with shot emerald: an halo for her marble- white face.Superior, graciously careless, conscious of her unique- ness, of her autochthonous entity, her head cocked to the left, her eyes fermented with the interplay of contradic- tory expiations, her lips a pale circonflex, her teeth with still paler gums showing their super-crucified half-smile. An exquisite recluse, formed in the island aesthetic, there alone comprehended. Hermetically enmousselined, the black spots in the fabric appeared so many punctures in the soft brightness of her sheath. Her arms of angelic nudity, the two breasts like two minute almonds, the scarf twined just above the adorable umbilical groove (nature desires that nude woman should be adorned with a girdle) composed in a cup-shaped embrace of the hips. Behind her the peacock halo, her pale pigeon-toed feet covered only by the watered-yellow fringe and by the bright-yellow anklet. She balanced, a little budding messiah; her head over-weighted; not knowing what to do with her hands ; her petticoat so simple, art long, very long, and life so very inextensive ; so obviously ready for the cosy-corner, for little talks in conservatories . . .And she was going to speak . . .The Tetrarch bulged in his cushions, as if she had already said something. His attention compelled that of the princes; he brushed aside the purveyor of pine- apples.She cleared her throat, laughing, as if not to be taken too seriously; the sexless, timbreless voicelet, like that of a sick child asking for medicine, began to the lyre accompaniment--?OUR TETRARCHAL PRECIEUSE 261"Canaan, excellent nothingness; nothingness-latent, circumambient, about to be the day after to-morrow, in- cipient, estimable, absolving, coexistent . . ."The princes were puzzled. "Concessions by the five senses to an all-inscribing affective insanity; latitudes, altitudes, nebulas, Medusae of gentle water, affinities of the ineradicable, passages over earth so eminently iden- tical with incalculably numerous duplicates, alone in in- definite infinite. Do you take me? I mean that the pragmatic essence attracted self-ward dynamically but more or less in its own volition, whistling in the bag- pipes of the soul without termination.--But to be nat- ural passives, to enter into the cosmos of harmonics. Hydrocephalic theosophies, act it, aromas of populace, phenomena without stable order, contaminated with pru- dence.--Fatal Jordans, abysmal Ganges--to an end with 'em--insubmersible sidereal currents--nurse-maid cos- mogonies."She pushed back her hair dusty with pollens, the soft handclapping began; her eyelids drooped slightly, her faintly-suggested breasts lifted slightly, showed more rosy through the almond-shaped eyelets of her corsage. She was still fingering the ebony lyre."Bis, bis, brava !" cried her audience.Still she waited."Go on! You shall have whatever you Hke. Go on,my dear," said the Tetrarch; "we are all so damned bored.

They were all afraid of each other. Tiaras nod- ded, but no one confessed to any difficulty in following the thread of her argument. They were, racially, so very correct.Salome wound oh in summary rejection of theogonies, thebdicies, comparative wisdoms of nations (short shift, tone of recitative). Nothing for nothing, perhaps one measure of nothing. She continued her mystic loquac- ity: "O tides, lunar oboes, avenues, lawns of twilight, winds losing caste in November, haymakings, vocations manquees, expressions of animals, chances."Jonquil colored mousselines with black spots, eyes fer- mented, smiles crucified, adorable umbilici, peacock aure- oles, fallen carnations, inconsequent fugues. One felt reborn, reinitiate and rejuvenate, the soul expiring sys- tematically in spirals across indubitable definitive show- ers, for the good of earth, understood everywhere, palp of Varuna, air omniversal, assured if one were but ready.Salome continued insistently: "The pure state, I tell you, sectaries of the consciousness, why this convention of separations, individuals by mere etiquette, indivisible? Breathe upon the thistle-down of these sciences, r's you call them, in the orient of my pole-star. Is it life to per- sist in putting oneself au courant with oneself, constantly to inspect oneself, and then query at each step: am I wrong? Species! Categories! and kingdoms, bah!

I expect it.""But. . . but. . . mydear. . . this. . . this. . ."

Calm evening.Stars out in full company, eternities of zeniths of em- bers. Why go into exile ?Salome, milk-sister to the Via Lactea, seldom lost her- self in constellations. Thanks to photo-spectrum analy- sis the stars could be classified as to color and magni- tudes; she had commanded a set of diamonds in the proportionate sizes to adorn nocturnally her hair and her person, over mousseline of deep mourning-violet with gold dots in the surface. Stars below the sixteenth mag---?264 INSTIGATIONSnitude were not, were not in her world, she envisaged her twenty-four millions of subjects.Isolated nebulous matrices, not the formed nebulae, were her passion; she ruled out planetiform discs and soughtbuttheunformed,perforated,tentacular. Orion's gaseous fog was the Brother Benjamin of her galaxy. But she was no more the "little" Salome, this night brought a change of relations, exorcised from her vir- ginity of tissue she felt peer to these matrices, fecund as they in gyratory evolutions. Yet this fatal sacrifice to the cult (still happy in getting out of so discreetly) had obliged her in order to get rid of her initiator, to undertake a step (grave perhaps), perhaps homicide; finally to assure silence, cool water to contingent people, --elixir of an hundred nights' distillation. It must serve.Ah, well, such was her life. She was a specialty, a minute specialite.There on a cushion among the debris of her black ebony lyre, lay Jao's head, like Orpheus' head in the old days, gleaming, encrusted with phosphorus, washed, anointed, barbered, grinning at the 24 million stars.As soon as she had got it, Salome, inspired by the true spirit of research, had commenced the renowned ex- periments after decollation; of which we have heard so much. She awaited. The electric passes of her hyp- notic manual brought from it nothing but inconsequential grimaces.She had an idea, however.She perhaps lowered her eyes, out of respect to Orion, stiffening herself to gaze upon the nebulae of her puber- ties . . . for ten minutes. What nights, what nights in the future! Who will have the last word about it? Choral societies, fire-crackers down there in the city.Finally Salome shook herself, like a sensible person,?OUR TETRARCHAL PRECIEUSE 265reset, readjusted her fichu, took off the gray gold-spotted symbol-jewel of Orion, placed it between Jao's lips as an host, kissed the lips pityingly and herrrietically, sealed them with corrosive wax (a very speedy procedure).Then with a "Bah !" mutinous, disappointed, she seized the genial boko of the late Jao Kanan, in delicate fem- inine hands.As she wished the head to land plumb in the sea with- out bounding upon the cliffs, she gave a good swing in turning. The fragment described a sufficient and phos- phorescent parabola, a noble parabola. But unfortu- nately the little astronomer had terribly miscalculated her impetus, and tripping over the parapet with a cry finally human she hurtled from crag to crag, to fall, shattered, into the picturesque anfractuosities of the breakers, far from the noise of the national festival, lacerated and naked, her skull shivered, paralyzed with a vertigo, in short, gone to the bad, to suffer for nearly an hour.She had not even the viaticum of seeing the phospho- rescentstar,thefloatingheadofJaoonthewater. And the heights of heaven were distant.Thus died Salome of the Isles (of the White Esoteric Isles, in especial) less from uncultured misventure than from trying to fabricate some distinction between herself andeveryoneelse; liketherestofus.?VIGENESIS, OR, THE FIRST BOOK IN THE BIBLE *("Subject to Authority")The sacred author of this work, Genesis, complied withtheideasacceptabletohisera; itwasalmostneces- sary ; for without- this condescension he would not have beenunderstood. Thereremainforusmerelyafewre- flections on the physics of those remote times. As for the theology of the book : we respect it, we believe it most firmly, we would not risk the faintest touch to its surface."In the beginning God created heaven and earth." That is the way they translate it, yet there is scarcely any one so ignorant as not to know that the original reads "thegodscreatedheavenandearth"; whichreadingcon- forms to the Phoenician idea that God employed lesser divinities to untangle chaos. The Phoenicians had been long established when the Hebrews broke into some few provinces of their land. It was quite natural that these latter should have learned their language and borrowedtheir ideas of the cosmos.Did the ancient Phoenician philosophers in "the timeof Moses" know enough to regard the earth as a point in relation to the multitude of globes which God has placed in immensity? The very ancient and false idea* Translated from an eighteenth-century author. 266?GENESIS 267that heaven was made for the earth has nearly always prevailed among ignorant peoples. It is scarcely pos- sible that such good navigators as the Phoenicians should not have had a few decent astronomers, but the old preju- dices were quite strong, and were gently handled by the author of Genesis, who wrote to teach us God's ways and not to instruct us in physics."The earth was all tohu bohu and void, darkness was over the face of the deep, the spirit of God was borne on the waters.""Tohu bohu" means precisely chaos, disorder. The earth was not yet formed as it is at present. Matter ex- isted, the divine power had only to straighten things out. The "spirit of God" is literally the "breath" or "wind" whichstirredupthewaters. Thisideaisfoundinfrag- ments of the Phoenician author, Sanchoniathon. The Phoeniciins, like all the other peoples of antiquity, be- lieved matter eternal. There is not one author of all those times who ever said that one could make something ofnothing. EvenintheBiblethereisnopassagewhich claims that matter was made out of nothing, not but what this creation from nothing is true, but its verity was un- known to the carnal Jews.Men have been always divided on the eternity of the world, but never on the eternity of matter."Gigni dfe nihilo nihilum, et in nihilum nil posse re- verti," writes Persius, and all antiquity shared his opin- ion. God said, "Let there be light," and there was light, and he saw that the light was good, and he divided the light from darkness, and he called the light day and the darkness night, and this was the evening and the morning of the first day. And God also said that the firmament, etc., the second day . . . saw that it was good.Let us begin by seeing whether the bishop of Av-;?268 INSTIGATIONSranches Huet, Leclerc, etc., are right, against those who claim that this is a subHme piece of eloquence.The Jewish author lumps in the light with the other objects of creation; he uses the same turn of phrase, "saw that it was good." The sublime should lift itself abovetheaverage. Lightisnobettertreatedthanany- thing else in this passage. It was another respected opinion that light did not come from the sun. Men saw it spread through the air before sunrise and after sunset they thought the sun served merely to reinforce it. The author of Genesis conforms to popular error: he has the sun and moon made four days after the light. It is un- likely that there was a morning and evening before the sun came into being, but the inspired author bows to the vague and stupid prejudice of his nation. It seems prob- able that God was not attempting to educate the Jews in philosophy or cosmogony. He could lift their spirits straight into truth, but he preferred to descend to their level. One can not repeat this answer too often.The separation of the light from the darkness is not part of another physical theory; it seems that night and day were mixed up like two kinds of grain ; and that they were sifted out of each other. It is sufficiently well es- tablished that darkness is nothing but the deprivation of light, and that there is light only in so far as our eyes receive the sensation, but no one had thought of this at that time.The idea of the firmament is also of respectable an- tiquity. People imagined the skies very solid, because the same set of things always happened there. The skies circulated over our heads, they must therefore be very strong. The means of calculating how many exhalations of the earth and how many seas would be needed to keep?GENESIS 269the clouds full of water? There was then no Halley to write out the equations. There were tanks of water in heaven. These tanks were held up on a good steady dome ; but one could see through the dome ; it must have been made out of crystal. In order that the water could be poured over the earth there had to be doors, sluices, cataracts which could be opened, turned on. Such was the current astronomy, and one was writing for Jews ; it was quite necessary to take up their silly ideas, which they had borrowed from other peoples only a little less stupid."God made two great lights, one to preside over the day, the other the night, and he made also the stars."True, this shows the same continuous ignorance of na- ture. The Jews did not know that the moonlight is merely reflection. The author speaks of the stars as luminous points, which they look like, although they are at times suns with planets swinging about them. But holy spirit harmonized with the mind of the time. If he had said that the sun is a million times as large as the earth, and the moon fifty times smaller, no one would have understood him. They appear to be two stars of sizes not very unequal."God said also : let us make man in our image, let him rule over the fishes, etc."What did the Jews mean by "in our image"? They meant, like all antiquity:Pinxit in eMgiem moderantum cuncta deorum.One can not make "images" save of bodies. No na- tion then imagined a bodiless god, and it is impossible to picture him as such. One might indeed say "god is noth- ing of anything we know," but then one would not have any idea what he is. The Jews constantly believed god corporal, as did all the rest of the nations. All the first?270 INSTIGATIONSfathers of the church also believed god coiporal, until they had swallowed Plato's ideas, or rather until the lights of Christianity had grown purer."He created them male and female."If God or the secondary gods created man male and fe- male in their resemblance, it would seem that the Jews believedGodandtheGodsweremaleandfemale. One searches to see whether the author meant to say that man was at the start ambisextrous or if he means that God made Adam and Eve the same day. The most natural interpretation would be that god made Adam and Eve at the same time, but this is absolutely contradicted by the formation of woman from the rib, a long time after the first seven days."And he rested the seventh day."The Phoenicians, Chaldeans, and Indians say that God made the world in six periods, which Zoroaster calls the six gahambars, as celebrated among Persians.It is incontestable that all these people had a theogony long before the Jews got to Horeb and Sinai, and before they could have had writers. Several savants think it likely that the allegory of the six days is imitated from the six periods. God might have permitted great na- tions to have this idea before he inspired the Jews, just as he had permitted other people to discover the arts before the Jews had attained any."The place of delight shall be a river which waters a garden, and from it shall flow four rivers, Phison . . .have contained about a third of Asia and Africa.

One must look furtherafieldforthemeaningofalltheserivers. Every commentator makes his own Eden.Some one has said that the Garden was like the gar- dens of Eden at Saana in Arabia Felix celebrated in an- tiquity, and that the parvenu Hebrews might have been an Arab tribe taking to themselves credit for the prettiest thing in the best canton of Arabia, as they have always taken to themselves the traditions of all the great peoples who enslaved them. But in any case they were led by the Lord."The Lord took man and set him in the midst of the garden, to tend it." It was all very well saying "tend it," "cultivate the garden," but it would have been very difficult for Adam to cultivate a garden 3,000 miles long. Perhaps he had helpers. It is another chance for the commentators to exercise their gifts of divination . . . as they do with the rivers."Eat not of the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil." It is difficult to think that there was a tree which taught good and evil ; as there are pear trees and peach trees. One asks why God did not wish man to know good from evil. Would not the opposite wish (if one dare say so) appear more worthy of God, and much more needful to man? It seems to our poor reason that God might have ordered him to eat a good deal of this fruit, but one must submit one's reason and conclude that obe- dience to God is the proper course for us."If you eat of the fruit you shall die."Yet Adam ate, and did not die in the least; they say he lived another nine centuries. Several "Fathers" have?272 INSTIGATIONSconsidered all this as an allegory. Indeed, one may say that other animals do not know that they die, but that man knows it through his reason. This reason is the tree of knowledge which makes him foresee his finish. This explanation may be more reasonable, but we do not dare to pronounce on it."The Lord said also: It is not good that man should bealone,letusmakehimanhelpmateliketohim." One expects that the Lord is going to give him a woman, but first he brings up all the beasts. This may be the trans- position of some copyist."And the name which Adam gave to each animal is its realname." Ananimal'srealnamewouldbeonewhich designated all the qualifications of its species, or at least the principal traits, but this does not exist in any lan- guage. There are certain imitative words, cock and cuckoo, and alali in Greek, etc. Moreover, if Adam had known the real names and therefore the properties of the animals, he must have already eaten of the tree of knowledge; or else it would seem that God need not have forbidden him the tree, since he already knew more than the Royal Society, or the Academy.Observe that this is the first time Adam is named in Genesis. The first man according to the Brahmins was Adimo, son of the earth. Adam and Eve mean the same thing in Phcenician, another indication that the holy spirit fell in with the received ideas."WhenAdamwasasleep, etc., . . . rib . . . madea woman." The Lord, in the preceding chapter, had al- ready created them male and female ; why should he take a rib out of the man to make a woman already existing? We are told that the author announces in one place whatheexplainsinanother. Wearetoldthatthisalle- gory shows woman submitted to her husband. Many?GENESIS 273people have believed on the strength of these verses that men have one rib less than women, but this is an heresy and anatomy shows us that a woman is no better provided with ribs than her husband."Now the serpent was the most subtle of beasts," etc., "he said to the woman," etc.There is nowhere the least mention of the devil or a devil. All is physical. The serpent was considered not only the subtlest of all beasts by all oriental nations ; he wasalsobelievedimmortal. TheChaldeanshadafable about a fight between God and a serpent ; it is preserved byPherecides. Origencitesitinhissixthbookagainst Celsus. They carried snakes in the feasts of Bacchus. The Egyptians attributed a sort of divinity to the ser- pent, as Eusebius tells us in his "Evangelical Prepara- tions," book I, chapter X. In India and Arabia, and in China, the serpent was the symbol of life; the Chinese emperors before Moses wore the serpent sign on their breasts.Eve is not surprised at the serpent's talking to her. Animalsarealwaystalkingintheoldstories; thuswhen Pilpai and Locman make animals talk no one is ever surprised.All this tale seems physical and denuded of allegory. It even tells us the reason why the serpent who ramped before this now crawls on its belly, and why we always try to destroy it (at least so they say) ; precisely as we are told in all ancient metamorphoses why the crow, who was white, is now black, why the owl stays at home in the daytime, etc. But the "Fathers" have believed it an alle- gory manifest and respectable, and it is safest to believethem."I will multiply your griefs and your pregnancies, yeshall bring forth children with grief, ye shall be beneath?274INSTIGATIONSthepowerofthemanandheshallruleoveryou." One asks why the multiplication of pregnancies is a punish- ment. It was on the contrary a very great blessing, and especially for the Jews. The pains of childbirth are alarming only for delicate women; those accustomed to work are brought to bed very easily, especially in hot cli- mates. Ontheotherhand,animalssometimessufferin littering, and even die of it. As for the superiority of man over woman, this is the quite natural result of his bodily and intellectual forces. The male organs are gen- erally more capable of consecutive effort, more fit for manual and intellectual tasks. But when the woman has fist or wit stronger than those of her husband she rules the roost, and the man is submitted to woman. This is true, but before the original sin there may have been neither pain nor submission."God made them tunics of skin."This passage proves very nicely that the Jews believed in a corporal god. A Rabbi named Eliezer has written that God covered Adam and Eve with the skin of the tempter serpent; Origen claims that the "tunic of skin" was a new flesh, a new body which God made for man, but one should have more respect for the texj:."And the Lord said 'Behold Adam, who is become like one of us.' " It seems that the Jews at first admired sev- eral gods. It is considerably more difficult to make out what they mean by the word God, Eloim. Several com- mentators state that this phrase, "one of us," means the Trinity, but there is no question of the Trinity in the Bible.** The reader will remember in Lander's Chinese dialogues, when the returned mandarin is telling the Emperor's children about England, there is one place where they burst into giggles "because they had been taught some arithmetic."?GENESIS 275The Trinity is not a composite of several gods, it is the same god tripled ; the Jews never heard tell of a god in three persons. By these words "like unto us" it is prob- ablethattheJewsmeantangels,Eloim. Forthisreason various rash men of learning have thought that the book was not written until a time when the Jews had adopted a belief in inferior gods, but this view is condemned.*"The Lord set him outside the garden of delights, that he might dig in the earth." Yet some say that God had put him in the garden, in order that he might cultivate it. If gardener Adam merely became laborer Adam, he was not so much the worse off. This solution of the diffi- culty does not seem to us sufficiently serious. It would be better to say that God punished Adam's disobedience by banishing him from his birthplace.Certain over-temerarious commentators say that the whole of the story refers to an idea once common to all men,i.e.,thatpasttimeswerebetterthanpresent. Peo- ple have always bragged of the past in order to run down the present. Men overburdened with work have imag- ined that pleasure is idleness, not having had wit enough to conceive that man is never worse off than when he has nothing to do. Men seeing themselves not infrequently miserable forged an idea of a time when all men were happy. Itisasiftheyhadsaid,onceuponatimenotree withered, no beast fell sick, no animal devoured another, the spiders did not catch flies. Hence the ideal of the Golden Age, of the egg of Arimana, of the serpent who stole the secret of eternal life from the donkey, of the combat of Typhon and Osiris, of Ophionee and the gods,of Pandora's casket, and all these other old stories, some- times very ingenious and never, in the least way, instruc-*The reader is referred to our heading: "Subject to au- thority".?276 INSTIGATIONStive. But we should believe that the fables of other na- tions are imitation of Hebrew history, since we still have the Hebrew history and the history of other savage peo- ples is for the most part destroyed. Moreover, the wit- nesses in favor of Genesis are quite irrefutable."And he set before the garden of delight a cherubin with a turning and flaming sword to keep guard over the gateway to the tree of life." The word "kerub" means bullock. A bullock with a burning sword is an odd sight atadoorway. ButtheJewshaverepresentedangelsas bulls and as sparrow hawks, despite the prohibition to makegravenimages. Obviouslytheygotthesebullsand hawks from Egyptians who imitated all sorts of things, and who worshipped the bull as the symbol of agriculture andthehawkasthesymbolofwinds. Probablythetale is an allegory, a Jewish allegory, the kerub means "na- ture." A symbol made of a bull's body, a man's head and a hawk's wings."The Lord put his mark upon Cain.""What a Lord !" say the incredulous. He accepts Abel's offering, rejects that of the elder brother, without giving any trace of a reason. The Lord provided the cause of the first brotherly enmity. This is a moral instruction, most truly, a lesson to be learned from all ancient fables, to wit, that scarcely had the race come into existence before one brother assassinated another, but what ap- pears to the wise of this world, contrary to all justice, contrary to all the common sense principles, is that God has eternally damned the whole human race, and has slaughtered his own son, quite uselessly, for an apple, and that he has pardoned a fratricide. Did I say "par- doned"? He takes the criminal under his own protec- tion. He declares that any one who avenges the murder of Abel shall be punished with seven fold the punishment?GENESIS277inflicted on Cain. He puts on him his sign as a safe- guard. The impious call the story both execrable and absurd. It is the delirium of some unfortunate Israelite, who wrote these inept infamies in imitation of stories so abundant among the neighboring Syrians. This insen- sate Hebrew attributed his atrocious invention to Moses, atatimewhennothingwasrarerthanbooks. Destiny, which disposes of all things, has preserved his work till our day; scoundrels have praised it, and idiots have be- lieved. Thus say the horde of theists, who while ador-ing God, have been so rash as to condemn the Lord God of Israel, and who judge the actions of the Eternal Be- ing by the rules of our imperfect ethics, and our errone- ous justice. They admit a god but submit god to our laws. Let us guard against such temerity, and let us once again learn to respect what lies beyond our compre- hension. Let us cry out "O Altitudo !" with all our strength."The Gods, Eloim, seeing that the daughters of men were fair, took for spouses those whom they chose.'' This flight of imagination is also common to all the na- tions. There is no race, except perhaps the Chinese,* which has not recorded gods getting young girls with child. Corporeal gods come down to look at their do- main, they see our young ladies and take the best for themselves; childrenproducedinthiswayarebetterthan other folks' children; thus Genesis does not omit to say* In Fenollosa's notes on Kutsugen's ode to "Sir in the Clouds," I am unable to make out whether the girl is more than a priestess.

Once again the book is in key with vulgar opinion."And I will pour the water floods over the earth."I would note here that St. Augustin (City of God, No. 8) says, "Maximum illud diluvium graeca nee latina tiovit historia." Neither Greek nor Latin history takes note of this very great flood. In truth, they knew only Deu- calion's and Ogyges' in Greece. These were regarded a:s universal in the fables collected by Ovid, but were totally unknown in Eastern Asia. St. Augustin is not in error when he says history makes no mention thereof."God said to Noah : I will make an agreement with you and with your seed after you, and with all the ani- mals." Godmakeanagreementwithanimals! Theun- believers will exclaim: "What a contract!" But if he make an alliance with man, why not with the animals ? What nice feeling, there is something quite as divine in this sentiment as in the most metaphysical thought. Moreover, animals feel better than most men think. It is apparently in virtue of this agreement that St. Francis of Assisi, the founder of the seraphic order, said to the grasshoppers, and hares, "Sing, sister hoppergrass, brouse brother rabbit." But what were the terms of the treaty ? That all the animals should devour each other ; that they should live on our flesh ; and we on theirs ; that after hav- ing eaten all we can we should exterminate all the rest, and that we should only omit the devouring of men stran-gled with our own hands. If there was any such pact it was presumably made with the devil.Probably this passage is only intended to show that God is in equal degree master of all things that breathe. This pact could only have been a command; it is called "alliance" merely by an "extension of the word's mean- ing." One should not quibble over mere terminology.?GENESIS279but worship the spirit, and go back to the time when they wrote this work which is scandal to the weak, but quite edifying to the strong."And I will put my bow in the sky, and it shall be a sign of our pact." Note that the author does not say "I have put" but "I will put my bow"; this shows that in common opinion the bow had not always existed. It is a phenomenon of necessity caused by the rain, and they give it as a supernatural manifestation that the worldshallnevermorebecoveredwithwater. Itisodd that they should choose a sign of rain as a promise that one shall not be drowned. But one may reply to this: when in danger of inundations we may be reassured by seeing a rainbow."Now the Lord went down to see the city which the children of Adam had builded, and he said, behold a people with only one speech. They have begun this and won't quit until it is finished. Let us go down and confound their language, so that no man may understand hisneighbor." Notemerelythatthesacredauthorstill conforms to vulgar opinion. He always speaks of Grod as of a man who informs himself of what is going on, who wants to see with his eyes what is being done on his estate, and who calls his people together to determine a course of action."And Abraham, having arrayed his people (there were of them three hundred and eighteen), fell upon the five kings and slew them and pursued them even to Hoba on the left side of Damas." From the south side of the lake of Sodom to Damas is 24 leagues, and they still had to cross Liban and anti-Liban. Unbelievers exult oversuchtremendousexaggeration. ButsincetheLord favored Abraham there is no exaggeration."And that evening two angels came into Sodom, etc."?28o INSTIGATIONSThe history of the two angels whom the Sodomites wanted to ravish is perhaps the most extraordinary whichantiquityhasproduced. Butwemustremember that all Asia believed in incubi and succubse demons, and that moreover these angels were creatures more perfect than man, and that they were probably much better look- ing, and lit more desires in a jaded, corrupt race than common men would have excited. Perhaps this part of the story is only a figure of rhetoric to express the horrible lewdness of Sodom and of Gomorrah. We offer this solution to savants with the most profound self-mistrust.As for Lot who offered his two daughters to the Sodomites in lieu of the angels, and Lot's wife metamor- phosed into the saline image, and all the rest of the story, what can one say of it? The ancient fable of Cinyra and Myrrha has some relation to Lot's incest with his daughters, the adventure of Philemon and Baucis is not without its points of comparison with that of the two angels appearing to Lot and his wife. As for the pillar of salt, I do not know what it compares with, perhaps with the story of Orpheus and Eurydice?A number of savants think with Newton and the learned Leclerc that the Pentateuch was written by Samuel when the Jews had learned reading and writing, and that all these tales are imitation of Syrian fable.But it is sufficient for us that it is all Holy Scripture; we therefore revere it without searching in it for any- thing that is not the work of the Holy Spirit. We should remember, at all times, that these times are not our times, and we should not fail to add our word to that of so many great men who have declared that the Old Testament is true history, and that everything in- vented by all the rest of the universe is mere fable.?GENESIS 281Some savants have pretended that one should remove from the canonical books all incredible matters which might be a stumbling block to the feeble, but it is said that these savants were men of corrupt heart and that they ought to be burned, and that it is impossible to be an honest man unless you believe that the Sodomites desired to ravish the angels. This is the reasoning of a species of monster who wishes to rule over wits.It is true that several celebrated church fathers have had the prudence to turn all these tales into allegory, like the Jews, and Philo in especial. Popes still more prudent desired to prevent the translation of these books into the everyday tongue, for fear men should be led to pass judgment on what was upheld for their adoration.One ought surely to conclude that those who perfectly understand this work should tolerate those who do not understand it, for if these latter do not understand it, it is not their fault ; also those who do not understand it should tolerate those who understand it most fully.Savants, too full of their knowledge, have claimed that Moses could not possibly have written the book of Genesis. One of their reasons is that in the story of Abraham, the patriarch pays for his wife's funeral plotin coined money, and that the king of Gerare gives a thousand pieces of silver to Sarah when he returns her, after having stolen her for her beauty in the seventy- fifth year of her age. They say that, having consulted authorities, they find that there was no coined money in thosedays. Butitisquiteclearthatthisispurechicane on their part, since the Church has always believed mostfirmlythatMosesdidwritethePentateuch. They strengthen all the doubts raised by the disciples of Aben- Hesra and Baruch Spinoza. The physician Astruc, father-in-law of the comptroller-general Silhouette, in?282 INSTIGATIONShis book, now very rare, entitled "Conjectures on Gene- sis," adds new objections, unsolvable to human wisdom; but not to humble submissive piety. The savants dare to contradict every line, the simple revere every line. Guard against falling into the misfortune of trusting our human reason, be contrite in heart and in spirit."And Abraham said that Sarah was his sister, and the kingofGeraretookhertohim." Weconfess,aswehave said in our essay on Abraham, that Sarah was then ninety years old; that she had already been kidnapped by one King of Egypt; and that a king of this same desert Gerare later kidnapped the wife of Abraham's son Isaac. We have also spoken of the servant Agar, by whom Abraham had a son, and of how Abraham treated them both. One knows what delight unbelievers take in these stories ; with what supercilious smiles they con- siderthem; howtheysetthestoryofAbimelechandthis same wife of Abraham's (Sarah) whom he passed off as his sister, above the "looi nights" and also that of an- other Abimelech in love with Rebecca, whom Isaac also passed off as his sister. One can not too often reiterate that the fault of all these studious critics lies in their persistent endeavour to bring all these things into accordwith our feeble reason and to judge ancient Arabs as they would judge the French court or the English."The soul of Sichem, son of King Hemor, cleaved to the soul of Dinah, and he charmed his sadness with her tender caresses, and he went to Hemor his father, and said unto him : Give me this woman for wife." Here the savants are even more refractory. What! a king's son marry a vagabond's daughter, Jacob her father loaded with presents! The king receives into his city these wandering robbers, called patriarchs ; he has the incredi- ble and incomprehensible kindness to get himself circum-?GENESIS 283cised, he and his son, his court and his people, in order to condescend to the superstition of this little tribe which didnotownahalfleagueofland! Andwhatreward do our holy patriarchs make him for such astonishing kindness? They wait the day when the wound of cir- cumcision ordinarily produces a fever. Then Simeon and Levi run throughout the city, daggers in hand; they massacre the king, the prince, his son, and all the in- habitants. The horror of this St. Bartholemew is only diminished by its impossibility. It is a shocking romance but it is obviously a ridiculous romance : It is impossible that two men could have killed a whole nation. One might suffer some inconvenience from one's excerpted foreskin, but one would defend oneself against two scoundrels, one would assemble, surround them, finish them off as they deserved.But there is one more impossible statement: by an exact supputation of date, we find that Dinah, daughter of Jacob, was at this time no more than three years of age; even if one tries to accommodate the chronology,she could not have been more than five: it is this that causes complaint. People say : What sort of a book isthis? Thebookofareprobatepeople,abookforso long unknown to all the earth, a book where right, rea- son and decent custom are outraged on every page, and which we have presented us as irrefutable, holy, dictated by God himself ? Is it not an impiety to believe it ? Is it not the dementia of cannibals to persecute sensible, modest men who do not believe it?To which we reply: The Church says she believes it. Copyists may have introduced revolting absurdities into reverend stories. Only the Holy Church can be judge of such matters. The profane should be led by her wisdom. These absurdities, these pretended horrors do?284 INSTIGATIONSnot affect the basis of our religion. Where would men be if the cult of virtue depended on what happened long ago to Sichem and little Dinah?"Behold the Kings who reigned in the land of Edom, before the children of Israel had a king."Behold another famous passage, another stone which doth hinder our feet. It is this passage which deter- mined the great Newton, the pious and sage Samuel Clarke, the deeply philosophical Bolingbroke, the learned Leclerc, the savant Freret, and a great number of other scholars to argue that Moses could not have been the author of Genesis.We do indeed confess that these words could only have been written at a time when the Jews had kings.It is chiefly this verse which determined Astruc to upset the whole book of Genesis, and to hypothecate memories on which the real author had drawn. His work is ingenious, exact, but rash. A council would scarcely have dared to undertake it. And to what end has it served, this ungrateful, dangerous work of this Astruc? To redouble the darkness which he set out to enlighten. This is ever the fruit of that tree of knowl- edge whereof we all wish to eat. Why should it be necessary that the fruits of the tree of ignorance should be more nourishing and more easy to manage?But what matter to us, after all, whether this verse, or this chapter, was written by Moses, or by Samuel or by the priest from Samaria, or by Esdras, or by any one else? In what way can our government, our laws, our fortunes, our morals, our well being, be tied up with the ignorant chiefs of an unfortunate barbarous country, called Edom or Idumea, always peopled by thieves? Alas, these poor shirtless Arabs never ask about our existence, they pillage caravans and eat barley bread.?GENESIS 285and we torment ourselves trying to find out whether there were kinglets in one canton of Arabia Petra before they appeared in the neighboring canton to the west of lake Sodom.O tmseras hominium mentes! O pectora caeca! ** Our author's treatment of Ezekiel merits equal attention.?VII ARNAUT DANIELRAZOEn Ar. Daniel was of Ribeyrac in PerigOrd* under Lemosi, near to Hautefort, and he was the best fashioner of songs in the Provengal, as Dante has said of him in his Purgatorio (XXVI, 140), and Tasso says it was he wrote "Lancillotto," but this is not known for certain, but Dante says only "proze di romanzi." Nor is it known if Benvenuto da Imola speaks for certain when he says En Arnaut went in his age to a monastery and sent a poem to the princes, nor if he wrote a satire on Boniface Castillane; but here are some of his canzos, the best that are left us ; and he was very cunning in his imitation of birds, as in the poem "Autet," where he stops in the middle of his singing, crying: "Cadahus, en son us," as a bird cries, and rhyming on it cleverly, with no room to turn about on the words, "Mas pel us, estauc clus," and in the other versets. And in "L'aura amara," he cries as the birds in the autumn, and there is some of this also in his best poem, "Doutz brais e critz."And in "Breu brisaral," he imitates, maybe, the rough singing of the joglar engles, from whom he learnt "Ac et no I'ac"; and though some read this "escomes," not "engles," it is likely enough that in the court of En Richart there might have been an English joglar, for En286?ARNAUT DANIEL 287Bertrans calls Richart's brother "joven re Engles," so why should there not be a joglar of the same, knowing alliterations? And he may, in the ending "piula," have had in mind some sort of Arabic singing; for he knew well letters, in Langue d'Oc and in Latin, and he knew Ovid, of whom he takes Atalanta; and may be Virgil; and he talks of the Palux Lerna, though most copyers have writ this "Uzerna," not knowing the place he spoke of. So it is as like as not he knew Arabic music, and perhaps had heard, if he not understood the mean- ing, some song in rough Saxon letters.And by making song in rimas escarsas he let into Provencal poetry many words that are not found else- where and maybe some words half Latin, and he uses many more sounds on the rhyme, for, as Canello or Lavaud has written, he uses ninety-eight rhyme sounds in seventeen canzos, and Peire Vidal makes use of but fifty-eight in fifty-four canzos and Folquet of thirty- three in twenty-two poems, and Raimbaut Orenga uses 12*9 rhymes in thirty-four poems, a lower proportion thanArnaut's. AndthesongsofEnArnautareinsome versets wholly free and uneven the whole length of the verset, then the other five versets follow in the track of the first, for the same tune must be sung in them all, or sung with very slight or orderly changes. But after the earlier poems he does not rhyme often inside the stanza. And in all he is very cunning, and has many uneven and beautiful rhythms, so that if a man try to read him like English iambic he will very often go wrong; though En Arnaut made the first piece of "Blank Verse" in the seven opening lines of the "Solssui"; and he, maybe, in thinning out the rhymes and having but six repetitions to a canzone, made way for Dantewhosanghislongpoeminthrees. Butthismuch?288 INSTIGATIONSis certain, he does not use the rhyme -atage and many other common rhymes of the Provencal, whereby so many canzos are all made alike and monotonous on one sound or two sounds to the end from the beginning.Nor is there much gap from "Lancan vei fueill' " or "D'autra guiza" to the form of the sonnet, or to the receipt for the Italian strophes of canzoni, for we have both the repetition and the unrepeating sound in the verset. And in two, versets the rhymes run abab cde abab cde; in one, and in the other abba cde abba cde; while in sonnets the rhymes run abab abab cde cde; or abba abba cde cde. And this is no very great difference. A sonetto would be the third of a son.And I do not give "Ac et no I'ac," for it is plainly told us that he learnt this song from a jongleur, and he says as much in his coda:Miells-de-ben renSit prenChanssos grazida C'Arnautz non oblida."Give thanks my song, to Miells-de-ben that Arnaut has not forgotten thee." And the matter went as a joke, and the song was given to Arnaut to sing in his reper- toire "E fo donatz lo cantar an Ar Daniel, qui et aysi trobaretz en sa obra." And I do not give the tenzon with Trues Malecs for reasons clear to all who have read it; nor do I translate the sestina, for it is a poor one, but maybe it is interesting to think if the music will not go through its permutation as the end words change their places in order, though the first line has only eight syllables.:?ARNAUT DANIEL 289And En Amaut was the best artist among the Proven- cals, trying the speech in new fashions, and bringing new words into writing, and making new blendings of words, so that he taught much to Messire Dante Alighieri as you will see if you study En Arnaut and the "De Vulgari Eloquio" ; and when Dante was older and had well thought the thing over he said simply, "il mi- glior fabbro." And long before Francesco Petrarca, he, Arnaut, had thought of the catch about Laura, laura,I'aura, and the rest of it, which is no great thing to his Credit. But no man in Provenqal has written as he writes in "Doutz brais": "E quel remir" and the rest of it, though Ovid, where he recounts Atalanta's flight from Hippomenes in the tenth book, had written:"cum super atria velum "Candida purpureum simulatas inficit umbras."And in Dante we have much in the style of: "Que jes Rozers per aiga que I'engrois."And Dante learned much from his rhyming, and follows him in agro and Meleagro, but more in a comprehension, and Dante has learned also of Ovid: "in Metamor- phoseos""Velut ales, ab alto "Quae teneram prolem produxit in sera nido,"although he talks so much of Virgil.I had thought once of the mantle of indigo as of a thing seen in a vision, but I have now only fancy to.?290 INSTIGATIONSsupport this. It is like that men slandered Arnaut for Dante's putting him in his Purgatorio, but the Trues Malecs poem is against this.En Arnaut often ends a canzone with a verset in different tone from the rest, as markedly in "Si fos Amors." In "Breu brisaral" the music is very curious, but is lost for us, for there are only two pieces of his music, and those in Milan, at the Ambrosiana (in R 71 superiore)And at the end of "Doutz brais," is a verset like the verset of a sirvente, and this is what he wrote as a message, not making a whole sirvente, nor, so far as we know, dabbling in politics or writing of it, as Bertrans de Born has; only in this one place is all that is left us. And he was a joglar, perhaps for his living, and only composed when he would, and could not to order, as is shown in the story of his remembering the joglar's can- zone when he had laid a wager to make one of his own."Can chai la fueilla" is more like a sea song or an estampida, though the editors call it a canzone, and "Amors e jois," and some others were so little thought of, that only two writers have copied them out in the manuscripts; and the songs are all different one from another, and their value nothing like even. Dante took note of the best ones, omitting "Doutz brais," which is for us perhaps the finest of all, though having some lines out of strict pertinence. But "Can chai la fueilla" is very cleverly made with five, six, and four and seven. And in "Sols sui" and in other canzos verse is syllabic, and made on the number of syllables, not by stresses, andthe making by syllables cannot be understood by those of Petramala, who imagine the language they speak was that spoken by Adam, and that one system of metric was?ARNAUT DANIFX 291made in the world's beginning, and has since existed without change. And some think if the stress fall not on every second beat, or the third, that they must have rightbeforeConstantine. AndtheartofEnAr.Daniel is not literature but the art of fitting words well with music, well nigh a lost art, and if one will look to the music of "Chansson doil motz," or to the movement of "Can chai la fueilla," one will see part of that which I mean, and if one will look to the falling of the rhymes in other poems, and the blending and lengthening of the sounds, and their sequence, one will learn more of this.And En Arnaut wrote between 1180 and 1200 of the era, as nearly as we can make out, when the Proyengal was growing weary, and it was to be seen if it could last, and he tried to make almost a new language, or at least to enlarge the Langue d'Oc, and make new things possi- ble. And this scarcely happened till Guinicello, and Guido Cavalcanti and Dante; Peire Cardinal went to realism and made satirical poems. But the art of sing- ing to music went well nigh out of the words, for Metastasio has left a few catches, and so has Lorenzo di Medici, but in Bel Canto in the times of Durante, and Piccini, Paradeis, Vivaldi, Caldara and Benedetto Mar- cello, the music turns the words out of doors and strews them and distorts them to the tune, out of all recogni- tion; andthephilosophiccanzoniofDanteandhistimes- men are not understandable if they are sung, and in their time music and poetry parted company; the can- zone's tune becoming a sonata without singing. Andthe ballad is a shorter form, and the Elizabethan lyrics are but scraps and bits of canzoni much as in the "nineties" men wrote scraps of Swinburne.Charles d'Orleans made good roundels and songs, as:::?292 INSTIGATIONSin "Dieu qui la fait" and in "Quand j'oie la tambourine," as did also Jean Froissart before him inReviens, ami ; trop longue est ta demeure EUe me fait avoir peine et doulour.Mon esperit te demande a toute heure. Reviens,ami; troplongueesttademeure.Car il n'est nul, fors toi, qui me sequerre, Ne secourra, jusques a ton retour. Reviens, ami ; trop longue est ta demeure Elle me fait avoir peine et doulour.And in:Le corps s'en va, mais le cceur vous demeure.And in:On doit le temps ainsi prendre qu'il vient: Tout dit que pas ne dure la fortune.Un temps se part, et puis I'autre revient: On doit le temps ainsi prendre qu'il vient.Je me comforte en ce qu'il me souvient Que tous les mois avons nouvelle lune: On doit le temps ainsi prendre qu'il vient: Tout dit que pas ne dure la fortune.Which is much what Bernart de Ventadour has sung:"Per dieu, dona, pauc esplecham d'amor Va sen lo temps e perdem lo melhor."--?ARNAUT DANIEL 293And Campion was the last, but in none of the later men is there the care and thought of En Arnaut Daniel for the blending of words sung out; and none of them all succeeded, as indeed he had not succeeded in reviving andmakingpermanentapoetrythatcouldbesung. But none of them all had thought so of the sound of the words with the music, all in sequence and set together as had En Arnaut of Ribeyrac, nor had, I think, even Dante Alighieri when he wrote "De Eloquio."And we find in Provence beautiful poems, as by Vidal when he sings:"Ab I'alen tir vas me I'aire,"And by the Viscount of St. Antoni:"Lo clar temps vei brunezirE'ls auzeletz esperdutz,Que'l fregz ten destregz e mutz E ses conort de jauzir.Done eu que de cor sospirPer la gensor re qu'anc fos.Tan joiosSon, qu'ades m'es visQue folh' e flor s'espandis. D'amor son tug miei cossir."and by Bertrans de Born in "Dompna puois di me," but these people sang not so many diverse kinds of music as En Arnaut, nor made so many good poems in differ- ent fashions, nor thought them so carefully, though En Bertrans sings with more vigor, it may be, and in the others, in Cerclamon, Arnaut of Marvoil, in de Venta- dour, there are beautiful passages. And if the art, now in France, of saying a song disia sons, we find..?294 INSTIGATIONSwritten of more than one troubadour--is like the art of En Arnaut, it has no such care for the words, nor such ear for hearing their consonance.Nor among the Provengals was there any one, nor had Dante thought out an sesthetic of sound ; of clear sounds and opaque sounds, such as in "Sols sui," an opaque sound like Swinburne at his best; and in "Doutz brais" and in "L'aura amara" a clear sound, with staccato; and of heavy beats and of running and light beats, asvery heavy in "Can chai la fueilla." Nor do we enough notice how with his drollery he is in places nearer to Chaucer than to the Italians, and indeed the Provengal is usually nearer the English in sound and in feeling, than it is to the Italian, having a softer humor, not a bitter tongue, as have the Italians in ridicule.Nor have any yet among students taken note enough of the terms, both of love terms, and of terms of the singing; though theology was precise in its terms, and we should see clearly enough in Dante's treatise when he uses such words as pexa, hirsuta, lubrica, combed, and shaggy and oily to put his words into categories, that he is thinking exactly. Would the Age of Aquinas have been content with anything less? And so with the love terms, and so, as I have said in my Guido, with meta- phors and the exposition of passion. Cossir, solatz, plazers, have in them the beginning of the Italian philo- sophic precisions, and amors qu'ins el cor mi plou is not a vague decoration. By the time of Petrarca the analy- sis had come to an end, only the vague decorations were left. And if Arnaut is long before Cavalcanti,Pensar de lieis m'es repausE traigom ams los huoills cranes, S'a lieis vezer nols estuich.?ARNAUT DANIEL 295leads toward "E gli occhi orbati fa vedere scorto," though the music in Arnaut is not, in this place, quickly apprehended. And those who fear to take a bold line hi their interpretation of "Cill de Doma," might do worse than re-read:"Una figura de la donna mia"and what follows it. And for the rest any man who would read Arnaut and the troubadours owes great thanks to Emil Levy of Freiburg i/b for his long work and his little dictionary (Petit Dictionaire Provengal- Frangais, Karl Winter's Universitatsbuchhandlung, Hei- delberg), and to U. A. Canello, the first editor of Arnaut, who has shown, I think, great profundity in his arrange- ment of the poems in their order, and has really hit upon their sequence of composition, and the develop- ments of En Amaut's trobar ; and lastly to Rene Lavaud for his new Tolosan edition.IIThe twenty-three students of Provencal and the seven people seriously interested in the technic and assthetic of verse may communicate with me in person. I give here only enough to illustrate the points of the raso, that is to say, as much as, and probably more than, the general reader can be bothered with. The translations are a make- shift; it is not to be expected that I can do in ten years what it took two hundred troubadours a century and a half to accomplish; for the full understanding of Ar-:?296 INSTIGATIONSnaut's system of echoes and blending there is no substi- tutefortheoriginal; butinextenuationofthelanguageof my verses, I would point out that the Provencals were not constrained by the modern literary sense. Their restraints were the tune and rhyme-scheme, they were not con- strained by a need for certain qualities of writing, with- out which no modern poem is complete or satisfactory. They were not competing with De Maupassant's prose. Their triumph is, as I have said, in an art between liter- ature and music; if I have succeeded in indicating some of the properties of the latter I have also let the former gobytheboard. Itisquitepossiblethatifthetrouba- dours had been bothered about "style," they would not have brought their blend of word and tune to so elaboratea completion."Can chai la fueilla" is interesting for its rhythm, forthe sea-chantey swing produced by simple device of csesuraeCan chai la fueilladels ausors entrecims,El freitz s'ergueilladon sechal vais' el vims,Dels dous refrimsvei sordezir la brueilla;Mas ieu soi primsd'amor, qui que s'en tueilla.The poem does not keep the same rhyme throughout, and the only reason for giving the whole of it in my English dither is that one can not get the effect of the thumping and iterate foot-beat from one or two strophes alone.:?ARNAUT DANIEL 297CAN CHAI LA FUEILLAWhen sere leaf fallethfrom the high forked tips,And cold appallethdry osier, haws and hips,Coppice he stripsof bird, that now none calleth.Fordel * my lipsin love have, though he galleth.Though all things freeze here,I can naught feel the cold.For new love sees, heremy heart's new leaf unfold;So am I rolledand lapped against the breeze hereLove who doth mouldmy force, force guarantees here.Aye, life's a high thing,where joy's his maintenance,Who cries 'tis wry thinghath danced never my dance,I can advanceno blame against fate's tithingFor lot and chancehave deemed the best thing my thing.Of love's wayfaringI know no part to blame,* Preeminence.?298 INSTIGATIONSAll other paring,coinpared, is put to shame,Man can acclaimno second for comparingWith her, no damebut hath the meaner beiaring.rid ne'er entanglemy heart with other fere,Although I manglemy joy by staying hereI have no fearthat ever at PontrangleYou'll find her peeror one that's worth a wrangle.She'd ne'er destroyher man with cruelty'Twixt here 'n' Savoythere feeds no fairer she,Than pleaseth metill Paris had ne'er joyIn such degreefrom Helena in Troy.She's so the rarestwho holdeth me thus gay,The thirty fairestcan not contest her sway;'Tis right, par fay,thou know, O song that wearestSuch bright array,whose quality thou sharest.:?ARNAUT DANIEL299Chanson, nor staytill to her thou declarest"Arnaut would sayme not, wert thou not fairest.""Lancan son passat" shows the simple and presum- ably early style of Arnaut, with the kind of reversal from more or less trochaic to more or less iambic move- ment in fifth and eighth lines, a kind of rh3rthm taken over by Elizabethan lyricists. Terms trochaic and iam- bic are, however, utterly inaccurate when applied to syllabic metres set to a particular melody:'Lancan son passat li giure E noi reman puois ni comba, Et el verdier la flors trembla Sus el entrecim on poma,La flors e li chan eil clar quil Ab la sazon doussa e coigna M'enseignon c'ab joi m'apoigna,Sai al temps de I'intran d'April.' LANCAN SON PASSAT LI GIUREWhen the frosts are gone and over.

And birds quhitter in forest now,Love inkirlie doth leaf and flower and bear.And trick my night from me, and stealing waste it, Whilst other wight in rest and sleep sojourneth.The sixth is in the following pattern, and the third strophe translates* Presumably De Born.?302INSTIGATIONSHath a man rights at love ?

Dante's "Rithi- morum quoque relationi vacemus" implies no careless- ness concerning the blending of rhyme sounds, for we find him at the end of the chapter "et tertio rithimorum asperitas, nisi forte sit lenitati permista: nam lenium asperorumque rithimorum mixtura ipsa tragoedia nite- scit," as he had before demanded a mixture of shaggy and harsh words with the softer words of a poem. "Nimo scilicet eiusdem rithimi repercussio, nisi forte novum aliquid atque intentatum artis hoc sibi praeroget." The De Eloquio is ever excellent testimony of the way in which, a great artist approaches the detail of metier.]?VIII TRANSLATORS OF GREEK EARLY TRANSLATORS OF HOMER L HUGHES SALELThe dilection of Greek poets has waned during the last pestilent century, and this decline has, I think, kept pace with a decline in the use of Latin cribs to Greek authors. The classics have more and more become a baton exclusively for the cudgelling of schoolboys, andless and less a diversion for the mature.I do not imagine I am the sole creature who has beenwell taught his Latin and very ill-taught his Greek (be- ginning at the age, say, of twelve, when one is unready to discriminate matters of style, and when the economy oftheadjectivecannotbewhollyabsorbing). Achild may be bulldozed into learning almost anything, but man accustomed to some degree of freedom is loath to ap- proach a masterpiece through five hundred pages of grammar. Even a scholar like Porson may confer with former translators.We have drifted out of touch with the Latin authors as well, and we have mislaid the fine English versions: Golding's Metamorphoses; Gavin Douglas' Mneids; Marlowe's Eclogues from Ovid, in each of which books a great poet has compensated, by his own skill, any loss321?322 INSTIGATIONSintransition; anewbeautyhasineachcasebeencreated. Greek in English remains almost wholly unsuccessful, or rather, there are glorious passages but no lohg or whole satisfaction. Chapman remains the best English "Homer," marred though he may be by excess of added ornament, and rather more marred by parentheses and inversions, to the point of being hard to read in many places.And if one turn to Chapman for almost any favorite passage one is almost sure to be disappointed; on the other hand I think no one will excel him in the plainer passages of narrative, as of Priam's going to Achilles in the XXIVth Iliad. Yet he breaks down in Priam's prayer at just the point where the language should be the simplest and austerest.Pope is easier reading, and, out of fashion though he is, he has at least the merit of translating Homer into something. ThenadirofHomerictranslationisreached by the Leaf-Lang prose; Victorian faddism having per- suaded these gentlemen to a belief in King James fustian; their alleged prose has neither the concision of verse nor the virtues of direct motion. In their preface they grumble about Chapman's "mannerisms," yet their version is full of "Now behold I" and "yea even as" and "even as when," tushery possible only to an affected age bent on propaganda. For, having, despite the exclusion of the Diciionnaire Philosophique from the island, finally found that the Bible couldn't be retained either as his- tory or as private Renter from J'hvh's Hebrew Press bureau, the Victorians tried to boom it, and even its wilfully bowdlerized translations, as literature."So spake he, and roused Athene that already was set;::?TRANSLATORS OF GREEK 323thereon.. . . Evenasthesonof. . . eveninsuch guise. ..."perhaps no worse than"With hollow shriek the steep of Delphos leaving"* but bad enough anyway.Of Homer two qualities remain untranslated: the magnificent onomatopoeia, as of the rush of the waves on the sea-beach and their recession in:xapd diva iroXii<^Xoi(rj3oto SaXAcin/suntranslated and untranslatable; and, secondly, the au- thentic cadence of speech; the absolute conviction that the words used, let us say by Achilles to the "dog-faced" chicken-hearted Agamemnon, are in the actual swing of words spoken. This quality of actual speaking is not untranslatable.

Sur le trone des cieux Venus n'est pas plus belle."Mais quelque soit I'amour qu'inspirent ses attraits, Puisse lUion enfin la perdre pour jamais, Puisse-t-elle bientot a son epoux rendue.Conjurer I'infortune en ces lieux attendue.':?328 INSTIGATIONSHugues Salel (1545), praised by Ronsard, is more pleasing"Le Roi Priam, et auec luy bon nombre De grandz Seigneurs estoient a I'ombre Sur les Crenaulx, Tymoetes et Pahthus, Lampus, Clytus, excellentz en vertus, Hictaon renomme en bataille, Ucalegon iadis de fort taille,Et Antenor aux armes nompareilMais pour alors ne seruantz qu'en conseil.La, ces Vieillards assis de peur du Hasle Causoyent ensemble ainsi que la Cignalle Ou deux ou trois, entre les vertes fueilles. En temps d'Este gazouillant a merveilles; Lesquelz voyans la diuine Gregeoise, Disoient entre eux que si la grande noise De ces deux camps duroit longe saision, Certainement ce n'estoit sans raision:Veu la Beaulte, et plus que humain outrage. Qui reluysoit en son diuin visaige.Ce neantmoins il vauldrait mieulx la rendre, (Ce disoyent ilz) sans gueres plus attendre. Pour eviter le mal qui peult venir,Qui la voudra encores retenir."Salel is a most delightful approach to the Iliads; he is still absorbed in the subject-matter, as Douglas and Golding were absorbed in their subject-matter. Note how exact he is in the rendering of the old men's mental attitude. Note also that he is right in his era. I mean simply that Homer is a little rustre, a .little, or perhaps a good deal, mediaeval, he has not the dovetailing of Ovid. Hehasonomatopoeia,asofpoetrysungout;he?TRANSLATORS OF GREEK329has authenticity of conversation as would be demanded by an intelligent audience not yet laminated with aesthetics; capable of recognizing reality. He has the repetitions of the chanson de geste. Of all the French and English versions I think Salel alone gives any hint ofsomeofthesecharacteristics. Tooobviouslyheisnot onomatopoeic, no. But he is charming, and readable, and "Briseis Fleur des Demoiselles" has her reality.Nicolo Valla is, for him who runs, closer:"Consili virtus, summis de rebus habebantSermones, et multa inter se et magna loquentes, Arboribus quales gracili stridere cicadseSsepe solent cantu, postquam sub moenibus altis Tyndarida aspiciunt, procerum tum quisque fremebat, Mutuasque exorsi, Decuit tot funera Teucros Argolicasque pati, longique in tempore bellumTantus in ore decor cui non mortalis in artusEst honor et vultu divina efflagrat imago.Diva licet fades, Danauum cum classe recedat' Longius excido ne nos aut nostra fatiget Pignora sic illi tantis de rebus agebant."This hexameter is rather heavily accented. It shows, perhaps, the source of various "ornaments" in later Eng- lish and French translations. It has indubitable sonority even though monotonous.It is the earliest Latin verse rendering I have yet come upon, and is bound in with Raphael of Volterra's first two Iliads, and some further renderings by Obsopeo.Odyssea (Liber primus) (1573)."Die mihi musa uirum captae post tempora Troiae Qui mores hominum multorum uidit et urbes?330INSTIGATIONSMulta quoque et ponto passus dum naufragus errat Ut sibi turn sociis uitam seruaret in altoNon tamen hos cupens fato deprompsit acerboOb scelus admissum extinctos ausumque malignum Qui fame compulsu solis rapuere iuvencosStuiti ex quo reditum ad patrias deus abstulit oras.

ANDREAS DIVUSIn the year of grace 1906, '08, or '10 I picked from the Paris quais a Latin version of the Odyssey by An- dreas Divus Justinopolitanus (Parisiis, In officina Chris- tiani Wecheli, M,D, XXXVIII), the volume containing also the Batrachomyomachia, by Aldus Manutius, and the "Hymni Deorum" rendered by Georgius Dartona Cretensis.

Teza, published his note, "Quale fosse la Casata di Andreas Divus Jus- tinopolitanus ?" This question I am unable to answer, nor do I greatly care by what name Andreas was known in the privacy of his life: Signore Dio, Signore Divino, or even Mijnheer van Gott may have served him as patronymic.

Sun to his slumber, shadows o'er all the ocean.Came we then to the bounds of deepest water,To the Kimmerian lands and peopled citiesCovered with close-webbed mist, unpierced ever, With glitter of sun-rays.Nor with stars stretched, nor looking back from heaven, Swartest night stretched over wretched men there. The ocean flowing backward, came we then to the place Aforesaid by Circe.Here did they rites, Perimedes and Eurylochus,And drawing sword from my hipI dug the ell-square pitkin.Poured we libations unto each the dead.:?340 INSTIGATIONSFirst mead and then sweet wine, water mixed with white flour,Then prayed I many a prayer to the sickly death's- heads.As set in Ithaca, sterile bulls of the bestFor sacrifice, heaping the pyre with goods.Sheep, to Tiresias only; black and a bell sheep.Dark blood flowed in the fosse,Souls out of Erebus, cadaverous dead.Of brides, of youths, and of much-bearing old ;Virgins tender, souls stained with recent tears,Many men mauled with bronze lance-heads,Battle spoil, bearing yet dreary arms.These many crowded about me.With shouting, pallor upon me, cried to my men formore beasts.Slaughtered the herds, sheep slain of bronze,Poured ointment, cried to the gods.To Pluto the strong, and praised Proserpine, Unsheathed the narrow sword,I sat to keep off the impetuous, impotent deadTill I should hear Tiresias.But first Elpenor came, our friend Elpenor, Unburied, cast on the wide earth,Limbs that we left in the house of Circe,Unwept, unwrapped in sepulchre, since toils urgedother.Pitiful spirit, and I cried in hurried speech: 'Elpenor, how art thou come to this dark coast? Cam'st thou a-foot, outstripping seamen?'And he in heavy speech '111 fate and abundant wine!

Dark blood he drankthen.And spoke : 'Lustrous OdysseusShalt return through spiteful Neptune, over dark seas.Lose all companions.' Foretold me the ways and the signs.Came then Anticlea, to whom I answered:'Fate drives me on through these deeps. I soughtTiresias,'ToldherthenewsofTroy.

Divus' Latin has, despite these wems, its quality; itisevensingable,thereareconstantsuggestions of the poetic motion; it is very simple Latin, after all, and a crib of this sort may make just the difference of permitting a man to read fast enough to get the swing and mood of the subject, instead of losing both in a dictionary.Even habentes when one has made up one's mind to it, together with less obvious exoticisms, does not upset one as"the steep of Delphos leaving."One is, of necessity, more sensitive to botches in one's own tongue than to botches in another, however care- fully learned.For all the fuss about Divus' errors of elegance Samuelis Clarkius and Jo. Augustus Ernestus do not seem to have gone him much better---with two hundred years extra Hellenic scholarship at their disposal.The first Aldine Greek Iliads appeared I think in 1504, Odyssey possibly later.* My edition of Divus is of 1538, and as it contains Aldus' own translation of the Frog-fight, it may indicate that Divus was in touch with Aldus in Italy, or quite possibly the French edition ispirated from an earlier Italian printing. A Latin Odyssey in some sort of verse was at that time in- finitely worth doing.Raphael of Volterra had done a prose Odyssey with the opening lines of several books and a few other brief* My impression is that I saw an Iliad by Andreas Divus on the Quais in Paris, at the time I found his version of the Odys- sey, but an impression of this sort is, after eight years, un- trustworthy, it may have been only a Latin Iliad in similar binding.:?TRANSLATORS OF GREEK343passages in verse. This was printed with Laurenzo Valla's prose Iliads as early as 1502. He begins:"Die mihi musa virum captae post tempora Troiae Qui mores hominum multorum vidit et urbes Multa quoque et ponto passus dum naufragus errat Ut sibi turn sotiis (sociis) vitam servaret in alto Non tamen hos cupiens fato deprompsit acerbo."Probably the source of "Master Watson's" English quantitative couplet, but obviously not copied by Divus:"Virum mihi die musa multiseium qui valde multum Erravit ex quo Troiae saeram urbem depop,ulatus est: Multorum autem virorum vidit urbes et mentemcognovitMultos autem hie in mare passus est dolores, suo inanimo,Liberans suamque animam et reditum sociorum."On the other hand, it is nearly impossible to believe that Clark and Ernestus were unfamiliar with Divus. Clark calls his Latin crib a composite "non elegantem utique et venustam, sed ita Romanam, ut verbis ~verba." A good deal of Divus' venustas has departed. Clark's hyphenated compounds are, I think, no more Roman than are some of Divus' coinage; they may be a trifle more explanatory, but if we read a shade more of color into &dtff<t>aTos olvos than we can into multum vinum, it is not restored to us in Clark's copiosum vinum, nor does terra spatiosa improve upon terra lata, tipvBelris being (if anjrthing more than lata) : "with wide ways or streets," the wide ways of the world, traversable, open towanderers.

Georgius Dartona gives, in the opening of the second hymn to Aphrodite"Venerandam auream coronam habentem pulchram VeneremCanam, quae totius Cypri munimenta sortita est Maritimae ubi illam zephyri vis molliter spirantis Suscitavit per undam multisoni maris,Spuma in molli: banc autem auricurae Horae Susceperunt hilariter, immortales autem vestes in-duereCapite vero super immortali coronam bene construc-tam posuerePulchram, auream: tribus autem ansis Donum orichalchi aurique honorabilis CoUum autem moUe, ac pectora argentea Monilibus aureis ornabant . . ." etc.Ernestus, adding by himself the appendices to the Epics, gives us"Venerandam auream coronam habentem pulchram VeneremCanam, quae totius Cypri munimenta sortita est Maritimae, ubi illam zephyri vis molliter spirantis Tulit per undam multisoni marisSpuma in molli: banc autem auro comam refigataeHoraeSusceperunt hilariter, immortales autem vestes in-duereCaput autem super immortale coronam bene construc-tam posuere;?TRANSLATORS OF GREEK345Pulchram, auream, perforatis autem auriculis Donum orichalci preciosi:CoUum autem molle ac pectora Candida* Monilibus aureis ornabant . . ." etc."Which things since they are so" lead us to feel that we would have had no less respect for Messrs. Clarkius and Ernestus if they had deigned to mention the names oftheirpredecessors. Theyhavenotdonethisintheir prefaces, and if any mention is made of the sixteenth- century scholars, it is very effectually buried somewhere in the voluminous Latin notes, which I have not gone throughintoto. Theiredition(Glasgow,1814)is,how- ever, most serviceable.TRANSLATION OF AESCHYLUSA SEARCH for Aeschylus in English is deadly, ac- cursed, mind-rending. Browning has "done" the Aga- memnon, or "done the Agamemnon in the eye" as the criticmaychoosetoconsider. Hehaswrittenamodest and an apparently intelligent preface:"I should hardly look for an impossible transmission of the reputed magniloquence and sonority of the Greek and this with the less regret, inasmuch as there is abun- dant musicality elsewhere, but nowhere else than in his poem the ideas of the poet."He quotes Matthew Arnold on the Greeks : "their ex- pression is so excellent, because it is so simple and so well subordinated, because it draws its force directly from the pregnancy of the matter which it conveys . . . not a word wasted, not a sentiment capriciously thrown in, stroke on stroke."* Reading ipyv(piourtii, variant ipyupkouriv, offered in footnote. In any case argentea is closer than Candida.--?346 INSTIGATIONSHe is reasonable about the Greek spelling. He points out that tbvov iBav KaXKiffrov avdpSiv sounds very poorly as "Seeing her son the fairest of men'' but is out- shouted in "Remirando il figliuolo bellissimo degli uomini," and protests his fidelity to the meaning of Aeschylus.His weakness in this work is where it essentially lay in all of his expression, it rests in the term "ideas" "Thought" as Browning understood it--"ideas" as the term is current, are poor two dimensional stuff, a scant, scratch covering. "Damn ideas, anyhow." An idea is only an imperfect induction from fact.The solid, the "last atom of force verging off into the first atom of matter" is the force, the emotion, the ob- jective sight of the poet. In the Agamemnon it is the whole rush of the action, the whole wildness of Kassan- dra's continual shrieking, the flash of the beacon fires burning unstinted wood, the outburst ofTpoiav Axaiwv oiaav,or the laterTpoiav 'Axatot rr/S' exova' iv iiTtpa."Troy is the greeks'." Even Rossetti has it better than Browning: "Troy's down, tall Troy's on fire," anything, literally anything that can be shouted, that can be shouted uncontrolledly and hysterically. "Troy is the Greeks' " is an ambiguity for the ear. "Know that our men are in Ilion."Anything but a stilted unsayable jargon. Yet with Browning we have:?TRANSLATORS OF GREEK "Troia the Achaioi hold," and later,"Troia do the Achaioi hold," followed by"this same dayI think a noise--no mixture--reigns i' the citySour wine and unguent pour thou in one vessel1347Anditdoesnotendhere. Infactitreachesthenadirof its bathos in a later speech of Klutaimnestra in the line"The perfect man his home perambulating!"We may add several exclamation points to the one which Mr. Browning has provided. But then all translation is a thankless, or is at least most apt to be a thankless and desolate undertaking.What Browning had not got into his sometimes ex- cellent top-knot was the patent, or what should be the patent fact that inversions of sentence order in an unin- flected language like English are not, simply and utterly are not any sort of equivalent for inversions and per- turbations of order in a language inflected as Greek and Latin are inflected. That is the chief source of his error. In these inflected languages order has other cur- rents than simple sequence of subject, predicate, object; and all sorts of departures from this Franco-English natural position are in Greek and Latin neither confus-ing nor delaying ; they may be both simple and emphatic, they do not obstruct one's apperception of the verbal relations.Obscurities not inherent in the matter, obscurities due not to the thing but to the wording, are a botch, and are"?348 INSTIGATIONSnot worth preserving in a translation. The work lives not by them but despite them.Rossetti is in this matter sounder than Browning, when he says that the only thing worth bringing over is the beauty of the original; and despite Rossetti's pur- ple plush and molasses trimmings he meant by "beauty" something fairly near what we mean by the "emotional intensity" of his original.Obscvurities (inherent in the thing occur when the author is piercing, or trying to pierce into, uncharted regions ; when he is trying to express things not yet current, not yet worn into phrase; when he is ahead of the emotional, or philosophic sense (as a painter might be ahead of the color-sense) of his contemporaries.As for the word-sense and phrase-sense, we still hear workmen and peasants and metropolitan bus-riders re- peating the simplest sentences three and four times, back and forth between interlocutors : trying to get the sense "I sez to Bill, I'm goin' to 'Arrow" or some other such subtlety from one occiput into another."You sez to Bill, etc." "Yus, I sez . . . etc."!""OThe first day's search at the Museum reveals "Aeschylus" printed by Aldus in 1518; by Stephanus in 1557, no English translation before 1777, a couple in the 1820's, more in the middle of the century, since 1880 past counting, and no promising names in the list. Sophocles falls to Jebb and does not appear satisfactory.From which welter one returns thankfully to the Thomas Stanley Greek and Latin edition, with Saml. Butler's notes, Cambridge, "typis ac sumptibus acade- micis," 1811--once a guinea or half a guinea per vol- ume, half leather, but now mercifully, since people no:?TRANSLATORS OF GREEK349longer read Latin, picked up at 2s. for the set (eight volumes in all), rather less than the price of their postage. Quartos in excellent type.Browning shows himself poet in such phrases as "dust, mud's thirsty brother," which is easy, perhaps, but is English, even Browning's own particular English, as "dust, of mud brother thirsty," would not be English at all; and if I have been extremely harsh in dealing with the first passage quoted it is still undisputable that I have^readJBrowning off and on fqrjeycnteati, years with no small pleasure and admiration, and am one of the few people who know anything about his Sordello, and have never read his Agamemnon, have not even now when it falls into a special study been able to get through his Agamemnon.Take another test passageOStos kaiv Ayaftkuvuv, k/xds ILSais, veKpds Sk rrjaSe de|ias x<<P^s"Epyov SiKalvas riKTOvos.

We turn to Browning and find:"--^this man is Agamemnon,My husband, dead, the work of this right hand here. Aye, of a just artificer : so things are."To the infinite advantage of the Latin, and the com- plete explanation of why Browning's Aeschylus, to say nothing of forty other translations of Aeschylus, is un- readable.?INSTIGATIONS Any bungling translation:"This is Agamemnon, My husband,Dead by this hand.And a good job. These, gentlemen, are the facts."No, that is extreme, but the point is that any natural wording, anything which keeps the mind off theatricals and on Klutaimnestra actual, dealing with an actual situation, and not pestering the reader with frills and festoons of language, is worth all the convoluted tush- ery that the Victorians can heap together.I can conceive no improvement on the Latin, it saves by dextra for 5e|ta$ x^posi it loses a few letters in "se habent," but it has the same drive as the Greek.The Latin can be a whole commentary on the Greek, or at least it can give one the whole parsing and order, and let one proceed at a comforable rate with but the most rudimentary knowledge of the original language. And I do not think this a trifle; it would be an ill day if men again let the classics go by the board; we should fall into something worse than, or as bad as, the counter- reformation: a welter of gum-shoes, and cocoa, and Y.

In his search through un- known art Fenollosa, coming upon unknown motives and prin- ciples unrecognised in the West, was already led into many modes of thought since fruitful in "new" western painting "^and poetry. He was a forerunner without knowing it and without being known, as such.He discerned principles of writing which he had scarcely time toputintopractice. Inlapanherestored,orgreatlyhelpedto restore, a respect for the native art. In America and Europe he cannot be looked upon as a mere searcher after exotics. His mind was constantly filled with parallels and comparisons between eastern and zvestern art. To him the exotic was always a means of fructification. He looked to an American renais- sance. The vitality of his outlook can be judged from the fact that although this essay was written some time before his death in 1908 / have not had to change the allusions to western con- ditions. The later movements in art have corroborated his theories.--Ezra Pound.]This twentieth century not only turns a new page in the book of the world, but opens another and a startling chapter. Vistas of strange futures unfold for man, of world-embracing cultures half weaned from Europe, of hitherto undreamed responsibilities for nations and races.357?358INSTIGATIONSThe Chinese problem alone is so vast that no nation can afford to ignore it. We in America, especially, must face it across the Pacific, and master it or it will master us. And the only way to master it is to strive with pa- tient sympathy to understand the best, the most hopeful and the most human elements in it.It is unfortunate that England and America have so long ignored or mistaken the deeper problems of Ori- ental culture. We have misconceived the Chinese for a materialistic people, for a debased and worn-out race. We have belittled the Japanese as a nation of copyists. We have stupidly assumed that Chinese history affords no glimpse of change in social evolution, no salient epoch of moral and spiritual crisis. We have denied the es- sential humanity of these peoples; and we have toyed with their ideals as if they were no better than comic songs in an "opera bouffe."The duty that faces us is not to batter down their forts or to exploit their markets, but to study and to come to sympathize with their humanity and their generous as- pirations. Their type of cultivation has been high. Their harvest of recorded experience doubles our own. The Chinese have been idealists, and experimenters in the making of great principles; their history opens a world of lofty aim and achievement, parallel to that ofthe ancient Mediterranean peoples. We need their best ideals to supplement our own--ideals enshrined in their art, in their literature and in the tragedies of their lives.We have already seen proof of the vitality and practi- cal value of oriental painting for ourselves and as a key to the eastern soul. It may be worth while to approach their literature, the intensest part of it, their poetry, even in an imperfect manner.?THE CHINESE WRITTEN CHARACTER 359I feel that I should perhaps apologize * for presuming to follow that series of brilliant scholars, Davis, Legge, St. Denys and Giles, who have treated the subject of Chinese poetry with a wealth of erudition to which I can proffer no claim. It is not as a professional linguist nor as a sinologue that I humbly put forward what I have to say. As an enthusiastic student of beauty in Oriental culture, having spent a large portion of my years in close relation with Orientals, I could not but breathe in something of the poetry incarnated in their lives.I have been for the most part moved to my temerity by personal considerations. An unfortunate belief has spread both in England and in America that Chinese and Japanese poetry are hardly more than an amusement, trivial, childish, and not to be reckoned in the world's serious literary performance. I have heard well-known sinologues state that, save for the purposes of profes- sional linguistic scholarship, these branches of poetry are fields too barren to repay the toil necessary for their cul- tivation.Now my own impression has been so radically and di- ametrically opposed to such a conclusion, that a sheer en- thusiasm of generosity has driven me to wish to share withotherOccidentalsmynewlydiscoveredjoy. Either I am pleasingly self-deceived in my positive delight, or else there must be some lack of aesthetic sympathy and of poetic feeling in the accepted methods of presenting thepoetryofChina. Isubmitmycausesofjoy.Failure or success in presenting any alien poetry in English must depend largely upon poetic workmanship in the chosen medium. It was perhaps too much to* [The apology was unnecessary, but Professor Fenollosa saw fit to make it, and I therefore transcribe his words.--E. P.]:?36o INSTIGATIONSexpect that aged scholars who had spent their youth in gladiatorial combats with the refractory Chinese charac- ters should succeed also as poets. Even Greek verse might have fared equally ill had its purveyors been per- force content with provincial standards of English rhym- ing. Sinologues should remember that the purpose of poetical translation is the poetry, not the verbal defini- tions in dictionaries.One modest merit I may, perhaps, claim for my work it represents for the first time a Japanese school of study in Chinese culture. Hitherto Europeans have been some- what at the mercy of contemporary Chinese scholarship. Several centuries ago China lost much of her creative self, and of her insight into the causes of her own life, but her original* spirit still lives, grows, interprets, trans- ferred to Japan in all its original freshness. The Japa- nese to-day represent a stage of culture roughly corre- sponding to that of China under the Sung dynasty. I have been fortunate in studying for many years as a pri- vate pupil under Professor Kainan Mori, who is prob- ablythegreatestlivingauthorityonChinesepoetry. He has recently been called to a chair in the Imperial Uni- versity of Tokio.My subject is poetry, not language, yet the roots of poetry are in language. In the study of a language so alien in form to ours as is Chinese in its written charac- ter, it is necessary to inquire how those universal ele- ments of form which constitute poetics can derive appro- priate nutriment.In what sense can verse, written in terms of visible hierogl3rphics, be reckoned true poetry? It might seem that poetry, which like music is a time art, weaving its unities out of successive impressions of sound, could:--?THE CHINESE WRITTEN CHARACTER 361with difficulty assimilate a verbal medium consisting largely of semi-pictorial appeals to the eye.Contrast, for example, Gray's line:The curfew tolls the knell of parting daywith the Chinese lineMoon Rays Like Pure Snow Moon rays like pure snow.Unless the sound of the latter be given, what have they in common ? It is not enough to adduce that each con- tains a certain body of prosaic meaning; for the ques- tion is, how can the Chinese line imply, as form, the very element that distinguishes poetry from prose?On second glance, it is seen that the Chinese words, though visible, occur in just as necessary an order as thephoneticsymbolsofGray. Allthatpoeticformre- quires is a regular and flexible sequence, as plastic as thought itself. The characters may be seen and read, silently by the eye, one after the other:Moon rays like pure snow.Perhaps we do not always sufficiently consider that thought is successive, not through some accident or weak- ness of our subjective operations but because the opera- tions of nature are successive. The transferences of force from agent to object which constitute natural phe- nomena, occupy time. Therefore, a reproduction of them in imagination requires the same temporal order.** [Style, that is to say, limpidity, as opposed to rhetoric. E. P.]:?362 INSTIGATIONSSuppose that we look otit of a window and watch a man. Suddenlyheturnshisheadandactivelyfixeshis attention upon something. We look ourselves and see that his vision has been focussed upon a horse. We saw, first, the man before he acted; second, while he acted; third, the object toward which his action was directed. In speech we split up the rapid continuity of this action and of its picture into its three essential parts or joints in the right order, and say :Man sees horse.It is clear that these three joints, or words, are only three phonetic symbols, which stand for the three terms of a natural process. But we could quite as easily de- note these three stages of our thought by symbols equally arbitrary, which had no basis in sound; for example, by three Chinese charactersMan / Sees HorseIf we all knew what division of this mental horse- picture each of these signs stood for, we could communi- cate continuous thought to one another as easily by draw- ingthemasbyspeakingwords. Wehabituallyemploy the visible language of gesture in much this same man- ner.But Chinese notation is something much more than arbitrary symbols. It is based upon a vivid shorthand picture of the operations of nature. In the algebraic figure and in the spoken word there is no natural con- nection between thing and sign: all depends upon sheer?THE CHINESE WRITTEN CHARACTER 363convention. But the Chinese method follows natural suggestion. First stands the man on his two legs. Sec- ond, his eye moves through space: a bold figure repre- sented by running legs under an eye, a modified picture of an eye, a modified picture of running legs but unfor- gettable once you have seen it. Third stands the horse on his four legs.The thought picture is not only called up by these signs as well as by words but far more vividly and concretely. Legs belong to all three characters : they are alive. The group holds something of the quality of a continuous moving picture.The untruth of a painting or a photograph is that, in spite of its concreteness, it drops the elejnent of natural succession.Contrast the Laocoon statue with Browning's lines: "I sprang to the saddle, and Jorris, and heAnd into the midnight we galloped abreast."One superiority of verbal poetry as an art rests in its getting back to the fundamental reality of time. Chinese poetry has the unique advantage of combining both ele- ments. Itspeaksatoncewiththevividnessofpainting, and with the mobility of sounds. It is, in some sense, moreobjectivethaneither,moredramatic. Inreading1 Chinese we do not seem to be juggling mental counters,but to be watching things work out their own fate. Leaving for a moment the form of the sentence, let us look more closely at this quality of vividness in the structureofdetachedChinesewords. Theearlierforms of these characters were pictorial, and their hold upon the imagination is little shaken, even in later conventional?364 INSTIGATIONSmodifications. It is not so well known, perhaps, that the great fiumber of these ideographic roots carry in them a verbal idea of action. It might be thought that a picture is naturally the picture of a thing, and that there- fore the root ideas of Chinese are what grammar calls nouns.But examination shows that a large number of the primitive Chinese characters, even the so-called radicals, are shorthand pictures of actions or processes.For example, the ideograph meaning "to speak" is a mouth with two words and a flame coming out of it. The sign meaning "to grow up with difficulty" is grass with a twisted root. But this concrete verb quality, both in nature and in the Chinese signs, becomes far more striking and poetic when we pass from such simple, orig- inal pictures to compounds. In this process of com- pounding, two things added together do not produce a third thing but suggest some fundamental relation be- tween them. For example, the ideograph for a "mess- mate" is a man and a fire.A true noun, an isolated thing, does not exist in na- ture. Things are only the terminal points, or rather the meeting points of actions, cross-sections cut through ac- tions, snap-shots. Neither can a pure verb, an abstract motion, be possible in nature. The eye sees noun and verb as one: things in motion, motion in things, and so the Chinese conception tends to represent them.The sun underlying the bursting forth of plants = spring.The sun sign tangled in the branches of the tree sign = east."Rice-field" plus "struggle"=male."Boat" plus "water," boat-water, a ripple.Let us return to the form of the sentence and see what?THE CHINESE WRITTEN CHARACTER 365power it adds to the verbal units from which it builds. I wonder how many people have asked themselves why the sentence form exists at all, why it seems so univer- sally necessary in all languages? Why must all possess it, and what is the normal type of it ? If it be so univer- sal it ought to correspond to some primary law of nature.I fancy the professional grammarians have given but a lame response to this inquiry. Their definitions fall into two types : one, that a sentence expresses a "com- plete thought"; the other, that in it we bring about a union of subject and predicate.The former has the advantage of trying for some nat- ural objective standard, since it is evident that a thought cannotbethetestofitsowncompleteness. Butinna- ture there is no completeness. On the one hand, prac- tical completeness may be expressed by a mere inter- jection, as "Hi! there!", or "Scat!", or even by shaking one's fist. No sentence is needed to make one's mean- ing more clear. On the other hand, no full sentence reallycompletesathought. Themanwhoseesandthe horse which is seen will not stand still. The man was planning a ride before he looked. The horse kicked whenthemantriedtocatchhim. Thetruthisthatacts aresuccessive,evencontinuous; onecausesorpassesinto another. And though we may string never so many clauses into a single compound sentence, motion leaks everywhere, like electricity from an exposed wire. All processesinnatureareinter-related; andthustherecould be no complete sentence (according to this definition) save one which it would take all time to pronounce.In the second definition of the sentence, as "uniting a subject and a predicate," the grammarian falls back on pure subjectivity. We do it all ; it is a little private jug- glingbetweenourrightandlefthands. Thesubjectis?366 INSTIGATIONSthataboutwhich/amgoingtotalk; thepredicateisthat which / am going to say about it. The sentence accord- ing to this definition is not an attribute of nature but an accident of man as a conversational animal.If it were really so, then there could be no possible test of the truth of a sentence. Falsehood would be as specious as verity. Speech would carry no conviction.Of course this view of the grammarians springs from the discredited, or rather the useless, logic of the middle ages. According to this logic, thought deals with ab- stractions, concepts drawn out of things by a sifting process. These logicians never inquired how the "qual- ities" which they pulled out of things came to be there. The truth of all their little checker-board juggling de- pended upon the natural order by which these powers or properties or qualities were folded in concrete things, yet they despised the "thing" as a mere "particular," or pawn. ItwasasifBotanyshouldreasonfromtheleaf- patterns woven into our table-cloths. Valid scientific thought consists in following as closely as may be the actual and entangled lines of forces as they pulse through things. Thought deals with no bloodless concepts but watches things move under its microscope.The sentence form was forced upon primitive men by nature itself. It was not we who made it; it was a re- flection of the temporal order in causation. All truth has to be expressed in sentences because all truth is the transferenceofpomer. Thetypeofsentenceinnature is a flash of lightning. It passes between two terms, a cloud and the earth. No unit of natural process can be less than this. All natural processes are, in their units, as much as this. Light, heat, gravity, chemical affinity, human will have this in common, that they redistribute force. Their unit of process can be represented as:?THE CHINESE WRITTEN CHARACTER 367 term?368 INSTIGATIONScation, were it not the natural order--that is, the order * ofcauseandeffect.^ It is true that there are, in language, intransitive and passive forms, sentences built out of the verb "tb be," and, finally, negative forms. To grammarians and logi- cians these have seemed more primitive than the transi- tive, or at least exceptions to the transitive. I had long suspected that these apparently exceptional forms had grown from the transitive or worn away from it by alteration or modification. This view is confirmed by Chinese examples, wherein it is still possible to watch thetransformation going on.The intransitive form derives from the transitive bydropping a generalized, customary, reflexive or cognate object. "He runs (a race)." "The sky reddens (it- self)." "We breathe (air)." Thus we get weak and incomplete sentences which suspend the picture and lead us to think of some verbs as denoting states rather than acts. Outside grammar the word "state" would hardly be recognized as scientific. Who can doubt that when we say, "The wall shines," we mean that it actively re- flects light to our eye?The beauty of Chinese verbs is that they are all tran- sitive or intransitive at pleasure. There is no such thing as a naturally intransitive verb. The passive form is evidently a correlative sentence, which turns about and makes the object into a subject. That the object is not in itself passive, but contributes some positive force of its own to the action, is in harmony both with scientificlawandwithordinaryexperience. TheEnglishpassive voice with "is" seemed at first an obstacle to this hy- pothesis, but one suspected that the true form was a gen- eralized transitive verb meaning something like "re-?THE CHINESE WRITTEN CHARACTER 369ceive,"whichhaddegeneratedintoanauxiliary. Itwas a delight to find this the case in Chinese.In nature there are no negations, no possible transfers of negative force. The presence of negative sentences in language would seem to corroborate the logicians' view that assertion is an arbitrary subjective act. We can assert a negation, though nature can not. But here again science comes to our aid against the logician: all apparently negative or disruptive movements bring into play other positive forces. It requires great effort to annihilate. Therefore we should suspect that, if we could follow back the history of all negative particles, we should find that they also are sprung from transitive verbs. It is too late to demonstrate such derivations in the Aryan languages, the clue has been lost, but in Chi- nese we can still watch positive verbal conceptions pass- ing over into so-called negatives. Thus in Chinese the sign meaning "to be lost in the forest" relates to a State of non-existence. English "not"=:the Sanskrit na, which may come from the root na, to be lost, to perish.Lastly comes the infinitive which substitutes for a spe- cific colored verb the universal copula "is," followed by a noun or an adjective. We do not say a tree "greens itself," but "the tree is green;" not that "monkeys bring forth live young," but that "the monkey is a mammal." Thisisanultimateweaknessoflanguage. Ithascome from generalizing all intransitive words into one. As "live," "see," "walk," "breathe," are generalized into states by dropping their objects, so these weak verbs nre in turn reduced to the abstractest state of all, namely,bare existence.There is in reality no such verb as a pure copula, nosuch original conception, our very word exist means "to stand forth," to show oneself by a definite act. "Is"?370INSTIGATIONScomes from the Aryan root as, to breathe. "Be" is from bhu, to grow.In Chinese the chief verb for "is" not only means actively "to have," but shows by its derivation that it expresses something even more concrete, namely, "to snatchfromthemoonwiththehand." Herethebald- est symbol of prosaic analysis is transformed by magic into a splendid flash of concrete poetry.I shall not have entered vainly into this long analysis of the sentence if I have succeeded in showing how po- etical is the Chinese form and how close to nature. In translating Chinese, verse especially, we must hold as closely as possible to the concrete force of the original, eschewing adjectives, nouns and intransitive forms wherever we can, and seeking instead strong and indi- vidual verbs.Lastly we notice that the likeness of form between Chinese and English sentences renders translation from one to the other exceptionally easy. The genius of the two is much the same. Frequently it is possible by omitting English particles to make a literal word-for- word translation which will be not only intelligible in English, but even the strongest and most poetical Eng- lish. Here, however, one must follow closely what is said, not merely what is abstractly meant.Let us go back from the Chinese sentence to the indi- vidualwrittenword. Howaresuchwordstobeclassi- fied? Aresomeofthemnounsbynature,someverbs and some adjectives ? Are there pronouns, and preposi- tions and conjunctions in Chinese as in good Christian languages ?One is led to suspect from an analysis of the Aryan languages that such differences are not natural, and that they have been unfortunately invented by grammarians?tHE CHINESE WRITTEN CHARACTER 371to confuse the simple poetic outlook on life. All nations have written their strongest and most vivid literature be- fore they invented a grammar. Moreover, all Aryati etymology points back to roots which are the equivalents of simple Sanskrit verbs, such as we find tabulated at the back of our Skeat. Nature herself has no grammar.* Fancy picking up a man and telling him that he is a noun, a dead thing rather than a bundle of functions ! A "part of speech" is only what it does. Frequently our lines of cleavage fail, one part of speech acts for an- other. They act for one another because they were orig- inally one and the same.Few of us realize that in our own language these very differences once grew up in living articulation ; that they still retain life. It is .only when the difficulty of placing some odd term arises or when we are forced to translate into some very different language, that we attain for a moment the inner heat of thought, a heat which melts down the parts of speech to recast them at will.One of the most interesting facts about the Chinese language is that in it we can see, not only the forms of sentences, but literally the parts of speech growing up, buddingforthonefromanother. Likenature,theChinese words are alive and plastic, because thing and action are notforiiiallyseparated. TheChineselanguagenaturally knows no grammar. It is only lately that foreigners, European and Japanese, have begim to torture this vital speech by forcing it to fit the bed of their definitions.* Even Latin, living Latin had not the network of rules they foist upon unfortunate school-children. These are borrowed sometimes from Greek grammarians, even as I have seen Eng- lish grammars borrowing oblique cases from Latin grammars. Sometimes they sprang from the grammatizing or categorizing passion of pedants. Living Latin had only the feel of the cases: the ablative and dative emotion.--E. P.?372 INSTIGATIONSWe import into our reading of Chinese all the weakness ofourownformalisms. Thisisespeciallysadinpoetry, because the one necessity, even in our own poetry, is to keep words as flexible as possible, as full of the sap of nature.Letusgofurtherwithourexample. InEnglishwe call "to shine" a verb in the infinitive, because it gives the abstract meaning of the verb without conditions. If we want a corresponding adjective we take a different word, "bright." If we need a noun we say "luminosity," whichisabstract,beingderivedfromanadjective.* To get a tolerably concrete noun, we have to leave behind the verb and adjective roots, and light upon a thing arbi- trarily cut off from its power of action, say "the sun" or "themoon." Ofcoursethereisnothinginnaturesocut off, and therefore this nounizing is itself an abstraction. Even if we did have a common word underlying at oncethe verb "shine," the adjective "bright" and the noun "sun," we should probably call it an "infinitive of the infinitive." According to our ideas, it should be some- thing extremely abstract, too intangible for use.TheChinesehaveoneword,mingormet. Itsideo- graph is the sign of the sun together with the sign of themoon.

P.]Thus you?THE CHINESE WRITTEN CHARACTER 373scholar may spend a week trying to decide what "part of speech" he should use in translating a very simple and direct thought from Chinese to English.The fact is that almost every written Chiftese word is properly just such an underlying word, and yet it is not abstract. It is not exclusive of parts of speech, but com- prehensive; notsomethingwhichisneitheranoun,verb, or adjective, but something which is all of them at once and at all times.. Usage may incline the full meaning now a little more to one side, now to another, according to the point of view, but through all cases the poet is free to deal with it richly and concretely, as does nature.In the derivation of nouns from verbs, the Chinese lan- guage is forestalled by the Aryan. Almost all the San- skrit roots, which seem to underlie European languages, are primitive verbs, which express characteristic actions of visible nature. The verb must be the primary fact of nature, since motion and change are all that we can rec- ognize in her. In the primitive transitive sentence, such as "Farmer pounds rice," the agent and the object are nouns only in so far as they limit a unit of action. "Farmer" and "rice" are mere hard terms which define theextremesofthepounding. Butinthemselves,apart from this sentence-function, they are naturally vei'bs. The farmer is one who tills the ground, and the rice is a plant which grows in a special way. This is indicated in the Chinese characters. And this probably exempli- fies the ordinary derivation of nouns from verbs. In all languages, Chinese included, a noun is originally "that which does something," that which performs the verbal action. Thus the moon comes from the root ma, and means"themeasurer." Thesunmeansthatwhichbe- gets.The derivation of adjectives from the verb need hardly?374INSTIGATIONSbe exemplified. Even with us, to-day, we can still watch participles passing over into adjectives. In Japanese the adjective is frankly part of the inflection of the verb, a special mood, so that every verb is also an adjective. This brings us close to nature, because everywhere the quality is only a power of action regarded as having an abstract inherence. Green is only a certain rapidity of vibration, hardness a degree of tenseness in cohering. In Chinese the adjective always retains a substratum of verbalmeaning. Weshouldtrytorenderthisintrans- lation, not be content with some bloodless adjectival ab- straction plus "is."Still more interesting are the Chinese "prepositions," they are often post-positions. Prepositions are so im- portant, so pivotal in European speech only because we have weakly yielded up the force of our intransitive verbs. We have to add small supernumerary words to bring back the original power. We still say "I see a horse," but with the weak verb "look," we have to add the directive particle "at" before we can restore the natural transitiveness.*Prepositions represent a few simple ways in which in- complete verbs complete themselves. Pointing toward nouns as a limit they bring force to bear upon them. That is to say, they are naturally verbs, of generalized or condensed use. In Aryan languages it is often diffi- cult to trace the verbal origins of simple prepositions. Only in "off" do we see a fragment of the thought "to throw off." In Chinese the preposition is frankly a verb, specially used in a generalized sense. These verbs* [This is a bad example. We can say "I look a fool", "look", transitive, now means resemble. The main contention is however correct. We tend to abandon specific words like resemble and substitute, for them, vague verbs with prepo- sitional directors, or riders.--E. P.];?THE CHINESE WRITTEN CHARACTER 375are often used in their specially verbal sense, and it greatly weakens an English translation if they are sys- tematically rendered by colorless prepositions.Thus in Chinese : By = to cause ; to ^ to fall toward in =to remain, to dwell; from=to follow; and so on. Conjunctions are similarly derivative, they usually serve to mediate actions between verbs, and therefore they are necessarily themselves actions. Thus in Chi-nese : Because = to use ; and = to be included under one another form of "and" := to be parallel ; or = to par- take; if3=toletonedo,topermit. Thesameistrueof a host of other particles, no longer traceable in the Aryan tongues.Pronouns appear a thorn in our evolution theory, since they have been taken as unanalyzable expressions of per- sonality. In Chinese even they yield up their striking secretsofverbalmetaphor. Theyareaconstantsource of weakness if colorlessly translated. Take, for exarri- ple, th? five forms of "I." There is the sign of a "spear inthehand"=averyemphaticI; fiveandamouth=a weak and defensive I, holding off a crowd by speaking; to conceal=a selfish and private I; self (the cocoonsign) and a mouth = an egoistic I, one who takes pleas- ure in his own speaking; the self presented is used only when one, is speaking to one's self.I trust that this digression concerning parts of speech may have justified itself. It proves, first, the enormous interest of the Chinese language in throwing light upon our forgotten mental processes, and thus furnishes a new chapter in the philosophy of language. Secondly, it is indispensable for understanding the poetical raw mate- rial which the Chinese language affords. Poetry differsfrom prose in the concrete colors of its diction. It is not enough for it to furnish a meaning to philosophers.t--?I1It must appeal to emotions with the charm of direct im- pression, flashing through regions where the intellect can onlygrope.* Poetrymustrenderwhatissaid,notwhat is merely meant. Abstract meaning gives little vividness, and fullness of imagination gives all. Chinese poetry demands that we abandon our narrow grammatical cate- gories, that we follow the original text with a wealth of concrete verbs.But this is only the beginning of the matter. So far we have exhibited the Chinese characters and the Chinese sentence chiefly as vivid shorthand pictures of actions andprocessesinnature. Theseembodytruepoetryas far as they go. Such actions are seen, but Chinese would be a poor language and Chinese poetry but a narrow art, could they not go on to represent also what is unseen. The best poetry deals not only with natural images but with lofty thoughts, spiritual suggestions and obscure re- lations. The greater part of natural truth is hidden in processes too minute for vision and in harmonies too largS, in vibrations, cohesions and in affinities. The, Chi-nese compass these also, and with great power and beauty.You will ask, how could the Chinese have built up agreatintellectualfabricfrommerepicturewriting? Tothe ordinary western mind, which believes that thoughtis concerned with logical categories and which rathercondemns the faculty of direct imagination, this featseems quite impossible. Yet the Chinese language withits peculiar materials has passed over from the seen to376INSTIGATIONSthe unseen by exactly the same process which all ancient 1races employed. This process is metaphor, the use of i|jnaterial images to suggest immaterial relations.* [Cf. principle of Primary apparition, "Spirit of Romance". E. P.]t [Compare Aristotle's Poetics.--E.

Theyare, almost without exception, vivid verbs. The wealth of European speech grew, following slowly the intricate maze of nature's suggestions and affinities. Metaphor was piled upon metaphor in quasi-geological strata.Metaphor, the revealer of nature, is the very substance ofpoetry. Theknowninterpretstheobscure,theuni- verseisalivewithmyth. Thebeautyandfreedomofthe observed world furnish a model, and life is pregnant with art. It is a mistake to suppose, with some philos- ophers of aesthetics, that art and poetry aim to deal with the general and the abstract. This misconception has?378INSTIGATIONSbeen foisted upon us by mediaeval logic. Art and poetry deal with the concrete of nature, not with rows of sep- arate "particulars," for such rows do not exist. Poetry is finer than prose because it gives us more concrete truthinthesamecompassofwords. Metaphor,itschief device, is at once the substance of nature and of lan- guage. Poetryonlydoesconsciously*whattheprim- itive races did unconsciously. The chief work of liter- ary men in dealing with language, and of poets especially, lies in feeling back along the ancient lines of advance.f He must do this so that he may keep his words enriched byalltheirsubtleundertonesofmeaning.

Let us first see how near it is to the heart of nature in its metaphors. We can watch it passing from the seen to the unseen, as we saw it pass-* [Vide also an article on "Vorticism" in the Fortnightly Re- view for September, 1914.

We have been told that these people are cold, practical, mechani- cal, literal, and without a trace of imaginative genius. That is nonsense.Our ancestors built the accumulations of metaphor into structures of language and into systems of thought. Languages to-day are thin and cold because we think lessandlessintothem. Weareforced,forthesakeof quickness and sharpness, to file down each word to its narrowestedgeofmeaning. Naturewouldseemtohave become less like a paradise and more and more like a factory. We are content to accept the vulgar misuse of the moment. A late stage of decay is arrested and em- balmed in the dictionary. Only scholars and poets feel painfully back along the thread of our etymologies and piece together our diction, as best they may, from for- gotten fragments. This anemia of modern speech is only too well encouraged by the feeble cohesive force of our phonetic symbols. There is little or nothing in a phonetic word to exhibit the embryonic stages of its growth. It does not bear its metaphor on its face. Weforget that personality once meant, not the soul, but the soul's mask. This is the sort of thing one can not pos- sibly forget in using the Chinese symbols.In this Chinese shows its advantage. Its etymology is constantly visible. It retains the creative impulse and process, visible and at work. After thousands of years the lines of metaphoric advance are still shown, and in many cases actually retained in the meaning. Thus a word, instead of growing gradually poorer and poorer as with us, becomes richer and still more rich from age to age, almost consciously luminous. Its uses in national philosophy and history, in biography and in?38o INSTIGATIONSpoetry, throw about it a nimbus of meanings. These centreaboutthegraphicsymbol. Thememorycanhold themandusethem. TheverysoilofChineselifeseems entangled in the roots of its speech. The manifold il- lustrations which crowd its annals of personal experi- ence, the lines of tendency which converge upon a tragic climax, moral character as the very core of the principle --all these are flashed at once on the mind as reinforc- ing values with an accumulation of meaning which a phonetic language can hardly hope to attain. Their ideo- graphs are like blood-stained battle flags to an old cam- paigner. With us, the poet is the only one for whom the accumulated treasures of the race-words are real and active. Poetic language is always vibrant with fold on fold of overtones, and with natural affinities, but in Chi- nese the visibility of the metaphor tends to raise thisquality to its intensest power.I have mentioned the tyranny of mediaeval logic. Ac-cording to this European logic thought is a kind of brick- yard. It is baked into little hard units or concepts. These are piled in rows according to size and then labeled with words for future use. This use consists in picking out a few bricks, each by its convenient label, and stick- ing them together into a sort of wall called a sentence by the use either of white mortar for the positive copula "is," or of black mortar for the negative copula "is not." In this way we produce such admirable propositions as "A ring-tailed baboon is not a constitutional assembly."Let us consider a row of cherry trees. From each of these in turn we proceed to take an "abstract," as the phrase is, a certain common lump of qualities which we may express together by the name cherry or cherry-ness. Next we place in a second table several such character- istic concepts: cherry, rose, sunset, iron-rust, flamingo.?THE CHINESE WRITTEN CHARACTER 381From these we abstract some further common quality, dilutation or mediocrity, and label it "red" or "redness." It is evident that this process of abstraction may be car- ried on indefinitely and with all sorts of material. We may go on forever building pyramids of attenuated con- cept until we reach the apex "being."But we have done enough to illustrate the character- istic process. At the base of the pyramid lie things, but stunned, as it were. They can never know themselves for things until they pass up and down among the layers ofthepyramids. Thewayofpassingupanddownthe pyramid may be exemplified as follows : We take a con- ceptoflowerattenuation,suchas"cherry"; weseethat it is contained under one higher, such as "redness." Then we are permitted to say in sentence form, "Cherryness is contained under redness," or for short, "(the) cherry is red." If, on the other hand, we do not find our chosen subject under a given predicate we use the black copula and say, for example, "(The) cherry is not liquid."From this point we might go on to the theory of the syllogism, but we refrain. It is enough to note that the practised logician finds it convenient to store his mind with long lists of nouns and adjectives, for these are nat- urally the names of classes. Most text-books on lan- guage begin with such lists. The study of verbs is meagre, for in such a system there is only one real work- ing verb, to-wit, the quasi-verb "is." All other verbs can be transformed into participles and gerunds. For ex- ample, "to run" practically becomes a case of "running." Instead of thinking directly, "The man runs," our logi- cian makes two subjective equations, namely: The indi- vidual in question is contained under the class "man"; and the class "man" is contained under the class of "run- ning things.*'?382 INSTIGATIONSThe sheer loss and weakness of this method is appar- ent and flagrant. Even in its own sphere it can not think half of what it wants to think. It has no way of bring- ing together any two concepts which do not happen to standoneundertheotherandinthesatiiepyramid. It is impossible to represent change in this system or any kind of growth. This is probably why the conception of evolution came so late in Europe. It could not make "way until it was prepared to destroy the inveterate logic of classification.Far worse than this, such logic can not deal with any kind of interaction or with any multiplicity of function. According to it, the function of my muscles is as isolated from the function of my nerves, as from an earthquake in the moon. For it the poor neglected things at the bases of the pyramids are only so many particulars or pawns.Science fought till she got at the things. All her work has been done from the base of the pyramids, not from the apex. She has discovered how functions cohere in things. She expresses her results in grouped sentences which embody no nouns or adjectives but verbs of spe- cial character. The true formula for thought is: The cherry tree is all that it does. Its correlated verbs com- pose it. At bottom these verbs are transitive. Such verbs may be almost infinite in number.In diction and in grammatical form science is utterly opposed to logic. Primitive men who created language agreed with science and not with logic. Logic has abused the language which they left to her mercy. Poetry agrees with science and not with logic.The moment we use the copula, the moment we express subjectiveinclusions,poetryevaporates. Themorecon- cretely and vividly we express the interactions ot things?THE CHINESE WRITTEN CHARACTERthebetterthepoetry.

We should beware of modern narrow utilita- rian meanings ascribed to the words in commercial dic- tionaries. We should try to preserve the metaphoric overtones. We should beware of English grammar, its hard parts of speech, and its lazy satisfaction with nouns and adjectives. We should seek and at least bear in mind the verbal undertone of each noun. We should avoid "is" and bring in a wealth of neglected English verbs. Most of the existing translations violate all of these rules.*The development of the normal transitive sentence rests upon the fact that one action in nature promotes another; thustheagentandtheobjectaresecretlyverbs. For example, our sentence, "Reading promotes writing," would be expressed in Chinese by three full verbs. Such a form is the equivalent of three expanded clauses and can be drawn out into adjectival, participial, infinitive, relative or conditional members. One of many possible examples is, "If one reads it teaches him how to write." Another is, "One who reads becomes one who writes."* [These precautions should be broadly conceived. It is not so much their letter, as the underlying feeling of objectifiea- tion and activity, that matters.--E. P.]383\?I384INSTIGATIONSBut in the first condensed form a Chinese would write, "Read promote write." The dominance of the verb and its power to obliterate all other parts of speech give us the model of terse fine style.I have seldom seen our rhetoricians dwell on the fact ' that the great strength of our language lies in its splendid array of transitive verbs, drawn both from Anglo-Saxon and from Latin sources. These give us the most indi- / vidual characterizations of force. Their power lies in K^^eir recognition of nature as a vast storehouse of forces. We do not say in English that things seem, or appear, or eventuate, or even that they are ; but that they do. Will is the foundation of our speech.* We catch the Demi- urge in the act. I had to discover for myself why Shakespeare's English was so immeasurably superior toall others. I found that it was his persistent, natural, and magnificent use of hundreds of transitive verbs. Rarely will you find an "is" in his sentences. "Is" weakly lends itself to the uses of our rhythm, in the un- accented syllables; yet he sternly discards it. A study of Shakespeare's verbs should underlie all exercises in style.We find in poetical Chinese a wealth of transitive verbs, in some way greater even than in the English of Shakespeare. Thisspringsfromtheirpowerofcombin- ing several pictorial elements in a single character.We have in English no verb for what two things, say the sun and moon, both do together. Prefixes and affixes merely direct and qualify. In Chinese the verb can be more minutely qualified. We find a hundred variants cluster- ing about a single idea. Thus "to sail a boat-for pur- poses of pleasure" would be an entirely different verb* [Compare Dante's definition of ?'rectitude" as the direction of the will, probably taken from Aquinas.--E, P.]?THE CHINESE WRITTEN CHARACTER 385from "to sail for purposes of commerce." Dozens of Chinese verbs express various shades of grieving, yet in English translations they are usually reduced to one mediocrity. Many of them can be expressed only by periphrasis, but what right has the translator to neglect the overtones? There are subtle shadings. We should strain our resources in English.It is true that the pictorial clue of many Chinese ideo- graphs can not now be traced, and even Chinese lexicog- raphers admit that combinations frequently contribute only a phonetic value. But I find it incredible that any such minute subdivision of the idea could have ever ex- isted alone as abstract sound without the concrete char- acter. It contradicts the law of evolution. Complex ideas arise only gradually, as the power of holding them together arises. The paucity of Chinese sound could not so hold them. Neither is it conceivable that the whole list was made at once, as commercial codes of cipher are compiled. Therefore we must believe that thephonetictheoryisinlargepartunsound. Themeta- phor once existed in many cases where we can not now trace it. Many of our own etymologies have been lost. It is futile to take the ignorance of the Han dynasty for omniscience.* It is not true, as Legge said, that the* [Professor FenoUosa is well borne out by chance evidence. The vorticist sculptor Gaudier-Brzeska sat in my room be- fore he went off to the war. He was able to read the Chi- nese radicals and many compound signs almost at pleas- ure. He was of course, used to consider all life and na- ture in the terms of planes and of bounding lines. Neverthe- less he had spent only a fortnight in the museum studying the Chinese characters. He was amazed at the stupidity of lexi- cographers who could not discern for all their learning the pictorial values which were to him perfectly obvious and ap- parent. Curiously enough, a few weeks later Esmond Dulac, who is of a totally different tradition, sat here, giving an im-?386 INSTIGATIONSoriginal picture characters could never have gone far in building up abstract thought. This is a vital mistake. We have seen that our own languages have all sprung from a few hundred vivid phonetic verbs by figurative derivation. A fabric more vast could have been built upinChinesebymetaphoricalcomposition. Noattenu- ated idea exists which it might not have reached more vividly and more permanently than we could have been expected to reach with phonetic roots. Such a pictorial method, whether the Chinese exemplified it or not, would be the ideal language of the world.Still, is it not enough to show that Chinese poetry gets back near to the processes of nature by means of itsvividfigure,itswealthofsuchfigure? Ifweattempt to follow it in English we must use words highly charged, words whose vital suggestion shall interplay as naturei^ interplays. Sentences must be like the mingling of the fringes of feathered banners, or as the colors of many flowers blended into the single sheen of a meadow.The poet can never see too much or feel too much. His metaphors are only ways of getting rid of the dead white plaster of the copula. He resolves its indiffer- ence into a thousand tints of verb. His figures flood things with jets of various light, like the sudden up-blaze of fountains.

He said the essence of the bamboo is in a certain way it grows, they have this in their sign for bamboo, all designs of bamboo proceed from it. Then he went on rather to disparage vorticism, on the grounds that it could not hope to do for the Occident, in one life-time, what had required centuries of development in China.--E. P.]?THE CHINESE WRITTEN CHARACTER 387this diilused poetry which they created, Shakespeare has condensed into a more tangible substance. Thus in all poetry a word is like a sun, with its corona and chro- mosphere; words crowd upon words, and enwrap each other in their luminous envelopes until sentences become clear, continuous light-bands.Now we are in condition to appreciate the full splen- dor of certain lines of Chinese verse. Poetry surpasses prose especially in that the poet selects for juxtaposition those words whose overtones blend into a delicate and lucid harmony. All arts follow the same law; refined harmony lies in the delicate balance of overtones. In music the whole possibility and theory of harmony is based on the overtones. In this sense poetry seems a more difficult art.How shall we determine the metaphorical overtones of neighboring words? We can avoid flagrant breaches likemixedmetaphor. Wecanfindtheconcordorhar- monizing at its intensest, as in Romeo's speech over the dead Juliet.Here also the Chinese ideography has its advantage, in even a simple line, for example, "The sun rises in the east."The overtones vibrate against the eye. The wealth of composition in characters makes possible a choice of words in which a single dominant overtone colors every plane of meaning. That is perhaps the most conspicu- ous quality of Chinese poetry. Let us examine our line.,4- ^ ^Sun N" Rises (in the) East\ \\?388 INSTIGATIONSThe sun, the shining, on one side, on the other the sign of the east, which is the sun entangled in the branches of a tree. And in the middle sign, the verb "rise," we have further homology; the sun is above the horizon, but beyond that the single upright line is like the grow- ing trunk-line of the tree sign. This is but a beginning, but it points a way to the method, and to the method of intelUgent reading.
