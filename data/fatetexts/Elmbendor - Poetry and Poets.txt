It is reprinted from the Reading List appended to their delightful book, The winged horse, by Joseph Auslander and Frank Ernest Hill.There are not many changes from the original. A few titles have been added. Some alterations in arrangement may make use of the lists a little easier.The most considerable change made has been the addition, at the request of American Library Association authorities, of appreciative notes to many titles. These notes have been gath ered from many sources, chief among which are the publica tions of the American Library Association, the Booklist and the A.L.A. catalog, 1926, the Book Review Digest and the offi cial order-room files of the Buffalo Public Library.The poets mentioned are, almost all of them, those celebrated in The winged horse and the editions are, where there was choice, simple ones which yet could be relied upon to be correct.In short, the list is a reader's list, not a student's or a buyer's list. Its sole purpose is to enhance, perhaps, delight in reading the poets' own work. In that hope it was originally made and in that hope it has been revised. January, 1931Theresa West Elmendorf    n 155   CONTENTS I. The Chosen Poets : TextsIV.

Lyrical dramas; tr. into English verse by JohnStuart Blackie. [1850] (Everyman) Dutton, 1906.In telling the great hero stories [he] made human sorrow majestic, but chiefly celebrated the power and justice of the gods. . . . To Aeschy lus Zeus and his companions were just, though fearful, much like the Jehovah of the Hebrew prophets. —The winged horse.2Aiken, Conrad. Selected poems. Scribner, 1929.He has woven melodies that might have charmed the Lady of Shalott back into her dream world. . . . He can make pictures lovely in their strangeness.3Appleton, William Hyde, comp. Greek poets in English verse. Houghton, 1893.Dutton, 1909.Aristophanes splits the heavens with a jest, and the rays of truth stream down from inaccessible solitudes of speculation. He has no epigram, no cleverness, no derivative humor. He is bald foolery. And yet he conveys mysticism : he conveys divinity. He alone stands still while the whole empyrean of Greek life circles about him.—/. /. Chapman.5Arnold, Matthew. Poetical works. (Globe ed.) Macmillan,1907.A defective ear, an uncertain choice and mastery of metre, yet often a lovely, unsought, unaffected music, always a tender, elegiac passion, a pure drawing and coloring of nature, a philosophic and scholarly aroma blended with exquisite delicacy of sentiment.—Sir Thomas Herbert Warren.1 4 Aristophanes.The Acharnians, and two other plays; tr. by J. H. Frere [1840] ; introd. by J. P. Maine. (Everyman)   8 POETRY AND POETS6Beowulf, The Story of ; tr. by Ernest J. B. Kirtlan into modern English prose.

Century, 1923.8Binyon, Laurence. Selected poems. Macmillan, 1922.He is more the poet when he departs from everyday life to kingdoms of myth, mysticism or pure imagination. His poetry combines the qual ities of fine scholarship, cultivated taste, and a nature sensitive to the ideal of beauty. — Harold Williams.9Blake, William. Poetical works ; ed. by John Sampson. Oxford, 1905.Nothing is pleasing to God except the glad invention of beautiful and exalted things. — William Blake.10Bridges, Robert. Poetical works, excluding the eight dramas. Oxford, 1912.Each one of the shorter poems is a mosaic in beautiful word-pattern, each word chosen with perfect fitness to serve its double function of expressing thought and enhancing the melody of the whole. — HaroldWilliams.11Brooke, Rupert. Collected poems; with introd. by G. E.Woodberry and a biographical note by Margaret Lavington.Dodd, 1915.A genuine poet, with talent almost of the first if not of the very best order. —Springfield Republican.12Browning, Elizabeth Barrett.

(Gladstone ed.) Crowell, n.d.The significant thing about Browning is that he invaded still another province in the interests of poetry; he showed that the psychological analysis of motives underlying human conduct was full of dramatic possibilities. —Herbert Read.15Bulfinch, Thomas. The age of chivalry, or Legends of KingArthur; enl. and rev. by E. E. Hale. Lothrop, 1858.One of the earliest popular versions of the Arthur stories. It charmed many readers long before Sidney Lanier and Howard Pyle made their fascinating versions. It adds some stories told from the Mabinogion, legends sung by Welsh bards.16Burns, Robert. Poems, songs and letters; ed. by AlexanderSmith. (Globe ed.) Macmillan, 1868. 17Poems and songs; introd. by James Douglas. (Every man) Dutton, 1905.Burns was bigger than any cause. He was bigger than a love fo:his rollicking fun with pity and tenderness as only Chaucer and Shake speare among the other great poets have been able to do. . . . He died leaving poetry a different thing from what it had been when he found it.—The winged horse.18Byron, George Gordon Noel, Lord.

If [the reader] will only stay long and travel [far] he may learn to see withChaucer's eyes. That would be to create for himself some such world as Chaucer's —a world of high ideals, but of large tolerance, of frank masculine humor, but of the most perfect delicacy of feeling. —Sir Henry Newbolt.25Chesterton, Gilbert Keith. Ballad of the White Horse. Lane, 1911.It was a convincing stroke of imagination to tell Alfred's story on the background of that gigantic, prehistoric carving which in White Horse Vale rides like a phantom across the landscape. Heretofore Alfred and his legend have received but a pale and unconvincing treatment in Eng lish poetry. Mr. Chesterton makes him real and magnetic. —Richard Le Gallienne.26Church, Alfred John. Heroes of chivalry and romance.

Poems ; with an introd. by E. H.Coleridge. Lane, 1907.Shelley, you feel, sings like a bird ; Blake, like a child or an angel ; but Coleridge certainly writes music. —Arthur Symons.30Colum, Padraic.

Macmillan, 1918.The story of both the Iliad and the Odyssey told in beautiful, simple, vigorous, rhythmic prose. — Realms of gold.31Cowper, William.

(Hilda Doolittle). Collected poems of H. D. Liveright, 1925.She has written the most exquisite verse of the imagist type. . . . She has shown, more than any other one poet, how free verse can be as finely polished as verse in rhyme and regular metre. — The winged horse.33Alighieri. Yale, 1915.DanteThe divine comedy ; tr. by Henry Johnson.A line-for-line blank verse translation, intended to make Dante's meaning as definite as possible, in a style clear and flexible, in modern English.3435tr. by Charles Eliot Norton. 3v. rev. ed.

Holt. 1920.His earliest poetry was verses, for children, of lovely, haunting music, but these verses, exquisite as they are, should not hide, from any "who look for deep meaning, values, high imagination in the verse they read, the later more serious poems, with their imaginative beauty, their glamour, their technical skill and charm, of one of the greatest living masters, the enigmatical figure among poets of today."37Dickinson, Emily. Complete poems ; with introd. by MarthaDickinson Bianchi. Little, 1924.Her poetry is very much like itself and little like any other. It is always brief and for the most part strange. . . . The poems dart at beauty and truth with such an intensity and dancing magic that nothing seems to matter but the life of them. It is strange, living, true poetry. — The winged horse.38Dole, Nathan Haskell, ed. The Greek poets ; an anthology. Crowell, 1904.Selections, in the best obtainable translations, from the greater Greeks. 39The Latin poets; an anthology. Crowell, 1905.

Oxford, 1929.One of the strangest and greatest ornaments of the Church of Eng land and of English poetry and prose. . . . No English poet of the past has exercised a stronger influence upon the younger poets of today.— Introd.41Drinkwater, John. Poems, 1908-1919. Houghton, 1919.its imagery bright His verse has dignity, sweetness and nobility, but it has also pith,vigor and clarity. ... Its imagination is sunny and clear. —M. C. Sturgeon....42Dryden, John. Poetical works. (Globe ed.) Macmillan, 1897.Not only in his own generation, or in the next, but in all that have succeeded, he has stood on the shelves of writers and offered the stim ulus of a style that is both musical and stout. Poets of widely varying complexions have made important use of him, never exactly reproducing him, for that is impossible even if desirable, but drawing from him the strength or beauty they have seemed to need. —Mark Van Doren.   43THE CHOSEN POETS : TEXTS 13Emerson, Ralph Waldo. Poems. (Centenary ed.) Houghton, 1904.The whole world takes on novelty in his verse; on all natural objects there is a lustre as if they were fresh bathed with dew and morning. . . . The verse is pervaded with the indescribable coloring of mountain sides, and the browns and greens of wide country prospects. . . . One often has, in reading him, that feeling of eternity in the thought which is the sign royal of greatness. —G. E. W oodberry.He is the greatest master of imaginative music ever born in Attica. He analyses, probes, discusses and shrinks from no sordidness; then he turns right away from the world and escapes "to the caverns that the sun's feet tread," or similar places, where things all are beautiful and interesting. . . . He saw too deep into the world and took things too rebelliously to produce calm and successful poetry. Yet many will feel as Philemon did: "If I were certain that the dead had consciousness, I would hang myself to see Euripides." —Gilbert Murray.45And then came Gilbert Murray, with fire and song, and made an English Electra of Euripides that blazed uplifted, like Swinburne's Atalanta. —Chicago Evening Post.46Everett, William, ed. The Italian poets since Dante ; accompanied by verse translations. Scribner, 1904.Presents a little known and delightful literature by means of critical and biographical sketches, with verse translations of specimen poems.— A. L. A. catalog, 1926.47Flecker, James Elroy. Collected poems. Doubleday, 1917.His ideal in poetry was the jewelled phrase, the gem-like verse, the exquisitely chiselled stanza or poem. "It is not," he declared, "the poet's business to save man's soul, but to make it worth saving." —Harold Williams.48Frost, Robert. Selected poems. Holt, 1930.He has been a farmer most of his life, and no poet, except Burns, has known farm work and farm thoughts so well. But Frost knows also the beauty of books and the beauty of thought and what he writes is both close to earth and close to eternity. —The winged horse.49Goldsmith, Oliver. Poems and plays.

Oxford, 1907.   14 POETRY AND POETS50Goldsmith, Oliver. (Standard lib.) Methuen, 1905.He contrived in his short life to leave behind him some of the most finished didactic poetry in the language; some unsurpassed familiar verse ; a series of essays ranking only below Lamb's ; a unique and original novel ; and a comedy which, besides being readable, is still acted to delight audiences. . . . —The stuff is Goldsmith —Goldsmith's phil osophy, Goldsmith's heart Goldsmith's untaught grace, simplicity and sweetness. —Austin Dobson.blHardy, Thomas. Collected poems. Macmillan, 1920.His melancholy, his deep sense of pity, his haunting consciousness of the irony of time which makes men's love and hatred and envy to per ish —these reflect themselves in the earliest as in the latest poems. — Harold Williams.52Herrick, Robert. Poems; a selection from Hesperides and noble numbers; introd. by T. B. Aldrich. (Century classics) Century, 1900.There is no English poet so thoroughly English as Herrick. He painted the country life of England of his own time as no other poet has painted it at any time. —Introduction.53Hesiod, the poems and fragments done into English prose withintrod. by A. W. Mair. Oxford, 1908.He made a kind of encyclopedia of the gods, their ancestry, birth, adventures and habits. He wrote also Works and days, a long poem about the ways to plough and sow and the way to choose a wife and to educate children and to go about farming and trading.—The winged horse.Homer.

Bell, n.d. ...This poem, then, is an artistic whole; and the key to its unity is the personality of Odysseus, the story of his return to Ithaca . . . this single unbroken thread of human interest aids essentially in making the Odyssey what we believe it is—the best of all good stories that ever were told. —W.

Mac-millan, 1897.Whether we look upon him as a master of frolic, or a master of pathos, his place among English poets is a high one.—Richard Garnett.67Horace. Complete works; tr. by various hands. (Everyman)Dent, 1911.There is a kind of eternal quality in some laughter and Horace has it. In his songs of varied pattern he stored wisdom, and luminous peace and ridicule and fun and that half-sad thing, humor. And always he has made them in some way beautiful, in all ways human. — The winged horse.68Housman, Alfred Edward. A Shropshire lad. Holt, 1900.Perhaps he learned early from Simonides, and Horace, and Sappho that the poet does well who says much in a few words. At any rate A Shropshire lad is full of poems that do this and in doing so it captures the very spirit of youth, its beauty and quickness and sadness. — The .winged horse.69Last poems. Holt, 1922.In nuance, in subtle and exquisite cadences of music and rhythm only one living poet has a more beautiful faculty than he. — Harold Williams.70Hutchinson, Winifred Margaret Lambert. The goldenporch; a book of Greek fairy tales. new ed. Longmans, 1925.Beautifully told tales from the Odes of Pindar for whom "all Hell is as enchanted ground." Arcadia, Argos and Thebes are the scenes where heroes fought the monsters, entertained the gods and talked with beasts and birds.71Keats, John. Poetical works; ed. with introd. and textualnotes by H. Buxton Forman. Oxford.No one else in English poetry, save Shakespeare, has in expression quite the fascinating felicity of Keats, his perfection of loveliness. — Matthew Arnold.Kipling, Rudyard. Rudyard Kipling's verse; inclusive edition, 1885-1918. Doubleday, 1919.The new and invigorating thing was that Kipling had taken the ballad meters and written stories about modern men and things. . . . No one    THE CHOSEN POETS: TEXTS 17had put such a vision into ballad poetry almost as simple as the old ballads. . . . Finally no one had taken the language of the streets, of the army, of the ships and made it poetry that was not humorous only, but often told unforgettable truths about life—its exhilaration, its nobility, its cruelty. — The winged horse.73Lang, Andrew. Tales of Troy and Greece. Longmans, 1907.Stories of the Iliad and the Odyssey told in simple language, but the stories are richer because told with much detail of Greek customs and ways of living.74Lanier, Sidney.Poems; ed. by his wife with a memorial by W. H. Ward. rev. ed. Scribner, 1916.The more you read "Marshes of Glynn" and the more you read any of Lanier's poetry the more certain you feel that he was among the truest men of letters whom our country has produced. He exhibits a lyric power hardly to be found in any other American.—Barrett Wendell. 75Lawton, WilliamYale, 1923.Cranston. The soul of the anthology.A general introduction to the Anthology with original translations ofthese poems of obscure, often unknown, deathless poets.76Lindsay, Vachel. Collected poems. Macmillan, 1923.From the first this poet has been led by certain sacred and impas sioned articles of faith—faith in beauty, in goodness, in the splendor of common things and common experiences. —Harriet Monroe.77Longfellow, Henry Wadsworth. Complete poetical works. (Cambridge ed.) Houghton, 1908.Longfellow wrote with an admirable simplicity. . . . He has a lastingplace in poetry but not among the few supreme singers.were to become great because he wrote poetry that millions of people love and read, Longfellow would be a great poet. —The winged horse.78Lowell, James Russell. Poetical works. (Cambridge ed.)Houghton, 1896.From Lowell I have myself received more help than from any other writer whatsoever. . . . For real utility, I think his shrewd sense and stern moral purpose worth all Keats and Shelley put together. I don't compare him with Keats, but I go to him for other articles —which I can't get from- Keats — namely Conscience, Cheerfulness and Faith. — John Ruskin.79Marvin, Francis Sydney.

Macmillan, 1925.Lover of the sea and of men, himself a sailor for a time in his youth, he has blended the beauty of older English poetry with the leap of modern life. ... In later poems Masefield writes at times with a calm golden beauty. — The winged horse.81Masters, Edgar Lee. Spoon River anthology. Macmillan, 1915.[He] took an Illinois town and made a book of the stories which the gravestones might tell. ... He made Americans feel the sweep and surge, the joy and pity of modern life. — The winged horse.82Meredith, George. Poetical works ; with some notes by G. M.Trevelyan. Scribner, 1912.Modern poetry owes much both to Meredith and Mr. Hardy—to Meredith a legacy of indomitable courage, "the warrior heart." . . . Meredith's faith is the faith of the Stoic, who recognizes the distinction between the things that are and the things that are not "within our power" to alter or to understand. —R. H. Strachan.83Millay, Edna St. Vincent. Renascence, and other poems.Kennerley, 1921.In her sonnets and poetic plays and short lyrics [she] has wrought some of the finest poems since Emily Dickinson. . . . There is less of terrific intensity in the younger poet's work, but more of human life.— The winged horse.84Milton, John. Poetical works; with introd. by David Mas-son. (Globe ed.) Macmillan, 1877. From the movement of the age in which he is the supreme figure in English poetry, [he] stands from first to last apart in magnificent isolation. Mackail.—... He stands now, as he stood in his own time, alone. /. W.85Moore, Thomas. Poetical works ; ed. by A. D. Godley. Oxford, 1910.Oddly enough there is no poet in English except Goldsmith who appeals to simple people so much as Moore. These two can often bring poetry home in triumph where even Shakespeare would never find an entrance. — Stephen Gwynn.86Morris, William. Poems; sel. and ed. by P. R. Colwell.Crowell, 1904.The answer to the criticism that holds narrative poetry to be the humblest order of the art is to be made in two words—Chaucer, Morris.   THE CHOSEN POETS: TEXTS 19In the hands of the two men the form attains a distinction that proves forever that, when employed with mastery, it is capable of the noblest ends. . . . Morris did something in the diction of his poetry that had never before, and is never likely again to be attempted successfully, he made an archaic idiom a living, personal and original thing.—John Drinkwater.87The earthly paradise. Longmans, 1871.A cycle of romantic stories suggested by the Canterbury tales. The corner stones are the Greek and the Northern epic cycles, the two greatest bodies of imaginative narration which the world has produced. The stories are told by Greeks, and by Norsemen of the later Middle Ages in the form in which they would then have been imagined. —/. W. Mackail.88The life and death of Jason. Longmans, 1909.There are few books in prose or verse, of fiction or anything else, so easy to read with enjoyment and rapidity. . . . Page after page slips by as the reader follows the heroes on their quest for the Golden Fleece and through all the wild adventures of their return as easily as if one were pacing down a long gallery hung with tapestries telling the whole story.—Alfred Noyes. 89One of the greatest epic stories of the world told in a magnificent chant. It is not an archaic story as Morris tells it ; for it deals with elemental things and "only the mightier movement sounds and passes, only winds and rivers, life and death." —Alfred Noyes.90Newbolt, Sir Henry. Poems new and old. Scribner, 1913.Mr. Newbolt is equipped with most of the qualities that go to the making of the poet. He has an eagerness for life, pity, delight in clean lines and rich color, a good, ringing, if not very subtle, musical sense, and an instinct for words. —Nation (L).The story of Sigurd the Volsung and the fall of theNibelungs. Longmans, 1904.91 Nibelungenlied.The lay of the Nibelung men; tr. by Ar thur S. Way. Cambridge, 1911.It tells of Siegfried, of the dragon he killed and the hoard of gold he got, of how he won the fair Kriemhild and helped Gunther, her brother, to win Brunhild the warrior-queen. — The winged horse.92The Nibelungenlied ; tr. with an introductory sketch and notes by Daniel Bussier Shumway.

Stokes, 1913.His poetry smacks of the earth and the vigorous life of men as Chaucer's does; he has spontaneity, a richness and variety of music; he has imagination and a rare narrative power and fine qualities of humor and emotion. —Bookman.96Petrarch. Sonnets, triumphs and other poems ; tr. by various hands.

He therefore, warmer than Dante, though not as for biddingly wise less aloof, though not less lofty, more lovable, more accessible, more human in his strength and weakness. We admire Dante. We adore Petrarch. — The winged horse.97Pindar.

The story of the champions of the Round Table. 3. The story of Launcelot and his companions. 4. The story of the Grail and the passing of Arthur.

Collected poems. 2d ed. Macmillan, 1926.In "A. E." we have a poet who walks, as surely as Blake walked, in a world whose gates are opened wide but which is yet all but incompre hensible save to the few. . . . "A. E." in all his vestments of iridescent colors and jewels has his great moments, but the poet reveals himself most clearly in the simpler garb. —Athenaeum.110 Sagas.IllSaga of Grettir the Strong; a story of the eleventh century; tr. by George Ainslie Wright.

Cambridge, 1921.This is the great story of the north, which should be to all our race what the tale of Troy was to the Greeks —to all our race first, and after wards when change of the world has made our race nothing but a name of what has been —a story, too—then should it be to those who come after us no less than the tale of Troy has been to us.—Preface to Story of the Volsungs.114Sandburg, Carl. Selected poems ; ed. by Rebecca West. Har- court, 1926.One feels in all these poems a true and deep emotion of love as the central controlling motive —love of the prairie country, the prairie towns and city and the people who struggle through toilsome lives there. It is this which gives richness to Sandburg's music. —Harriet Monroe.The Greeks used to say that Homer was the greatest of men who made poetry and Sappho the greatest of women. . . .

Selections from Swin burne; ed. by W. O. Raymond.

The winged horse. 131Virgil.by John Addington Symonds. McKay, 1900.Virgil is the perfect artist, dealing considerately with a difficult mat ter, melting a reluctant language in the sevenfold furnace of an intense imagination, forging and tempering, retempering and reforging till the last trace of imperfection disappears. The finished work carries the result of all the labor, but it is transformed into beauty. —/. IV. Mackail.132Aeneids ; done into English verse by William Morris. Longmans, 1875.Not only a remarkable poem, but one of the most important criticisms ever made on Virgil. Mr. Morris, who alone has given us the Virgilian sweetness, keeps as closely to the original as Conington himself.—J. W.Mackail.133Whitman, Walt. Leaves of grass ; abridged edition with anintrod. by Emory Holloway. Doubleday, 1926.His first and most obvious service to poetic art was his insistence on freedom of form—his rejection of the usually accepted English metrics, and his success in writing great poems, without their aid. His second was the rejection of cliches, including archaic diction and so-called poetic phrasing. His third service, his reassertion of the ancient conception of the poet as a prophet, and of poetry, as religion, as an ecstatic expression of faith.—Harriet Monroe.134Wordsworth, William.

Dutton, 1912.(Everyman) It strives to show that heroic verse is verse dealing with heroes, heroic characters, heroic acts, quite irrespective of the nationality or century of the actors themselves. . . .

Bk.S, Greenwood and Robin Hood. Bk.6, From Chevy Chase and Homeric deeds of Douglas and Percy to Border feuds. Bk.7, The ballad in various aspects of false beginning and decline.167The Oxford book of English verse, 1250-1900. Ox ford, 1900.On the whole, all things considered, perhaps the most satisfying an thology of English poetry. It follows the long, glorious stream of Eng lish lyric verse from the middle of the thirteenth century to the very close of the nineteenth.

Aeschylean tragedy. Univ. of Cal ifornia, 1924.He handles his learning with an easy touch. He is vivacious and sparkling. He scatters allusion rather freely yet with telling effect. — Nation.352Sturgeon, Mary C. Studies of contemporary poets. Rev. ed. Dodd, 1919.353Swinburne, Algernon Charles. Essays and studies. Chatto, 1911.354Taggard, Genevieve. The life and mind of Emily Dickinson.Knopf, 1930.Here for once Emily Dickinson has escaped from her kin and met her kind. She has been patiently, understandingly, beautifully interpreted by a mind fitted to cope with her own. —N. Y. Tribune: Books.355Thompson, Francis. Shelley; with introd. by the Right Hon. George Wyndham. Scribner, 1909.I suppose [this] to be the finest piece of criticism written upon him. Sir Arthur Quiller-Couch.356Tyrrell, Robert Yelverton. Essays on Greek literature.Macmillan, 1909.The gist of the book is thoroughly enjoyable reading and reliable scholarship. —North American.357Untermeyer, Louis. The new era in American poetry. Holt,1919.Reprinted for the most part from periodicals from 1910-1919. They are of unequal worth and interest but their value is the greater because of many quotations from the poets reviewed.   358STUDIES OF THE CHOSEN POETS S3Van Doren, Mark. The poetry of John Dryden. Harcourt, 1920.There is some novelty, I hope, in a treatment, on an extended and more or less enthusiastic scale, of Dryden's non-dramatic verse as a body, with attention to the celebrator, the satirist, the journalist, thesinger and the story-teller all together. —Preface,359Van Dyke, Henry. Studies in Tennyson. Scribner, 1920.360Warren, Sir Thomas Herbert. Essays of poets and poetryancient and modern. Murray, 1909.No lover of literature could read the volume without having his ad mirations quickened and harmonized, without a renewal of the sense of the dignity and sweetness of the old traditions of art and song.—Satur day Review.361Watts-Dunton, Theodore. Old familiar faces. Dutton,1916.362Whiting, Lilian. The Brownings ; their life and art. Little, 1911.363Williams, Charles. Poetry at present. Oxford, 1930.An excellent introduction to the work of sixteen contemporary poets who, in the author's opinion, have in however small an extent enlarged the boundaries of English verse. —Booklist.364Williams, Stanley Thomas. Studies in Victorian literature. Dutton, 1923.365Winchester, Caleb Thomas. William Wordsworth ; how toknow him. Bobbs, 1916.Its criticism is usually sound and at times markedly penetrating. — Yale Review.366Woodberry, George Edward. Life of Edgar Allan Poe ; personal and literary. 2v. Houghton, 1909.Besides the interest in the personality and adventures of that "bright but unsteady light" of poetry, this authoritative life has "two special interests in that it was a life led outside of New England, and that it embodies much contemporaneous literary history not involved in any other life of our greater writers." —Preface.    54 POETRY AND POETS 367Ralph Waldo Emerson. Macmillan, 1907.Charmingly written—the style so distinctive, the ideas so often lu minous and so generally fascinating. —Literary Digest.368Wylie, Eleanor. The orphan angel. Knopf, 1926.Shelley is the hero of her story, Shelley rescued, near dead from drowning off Leghorn, by a Yankee clipper brig and, not unwillingly, carried off to America. —Saturday Review.369Yeats, William Butler.
