FANTASIES.




    Altruism: A Legend of Old Persia.


    In the flowery land of Persia
    Long ago, as poets tell,
    Where three rivers met together
    Did a happy people dwell.
    Never did these happy people
    Suffer sickness, plague, or dearth,
    Living in a golden climate
    In the fairest place on earth,
    Living thus thro' endless summers
    And half-summers hardly colder,
    Growing, tho' they hardly guessed it,
    Very gradually older.

    I can very well imagine
    These old Persian lords and ladies
    Sitting in their pleasant gardens,
    Dreaming, dozing, where the shade is;
    Almond trees a mass of blossom,
    Roses, roses, red as wine,
    With the helmets of the tulips
    Flaming in a martial line,
    While beside a marble basin,
    With a fountain gushing forth,
    Stands a red-legged crane, alighted
    From the deserts of the North.

    So they lived these ancient people,
    With the happy harmless faces,
    Dreaming till the purple twilight
    In their flowery garden-places,
    Finding every year the sunshine
    And the wind a little colder,
    Growing, tho' they hardly guessed it,
    Very gradually older,
    Till at last they grew so frail
    That to their gardens they were carried,
    Very feeble and exhausted,
    Weak as babes--But still they tarried,

    Lying till the purple twilight
    Wrapped in wool but hardly warm,
    Wearing shawls of costliest texture
    Lest the wind might do them harm,
    Feeling very faint sensations
    Of delight in each old breast,
    Twittering with tiny voices
    Like young swallows in a nest.
    Then the young men spoke together
    As they feasted in the taverns,
    "It is time to take our Fathers,
    We must bear them to the Caverns."

    In a mountain were the Caverns,
    Fourteen leagues across the sand,
    Fourteen leagues across the desert
    In a naked golden land.
    Black and bold and bare the mountain
    Modelled into many shapes,
    Cones and pyramids and pillars,
    Beetling cliffs and jutting capes.
    And within it were the Caverns
    Tunnelled into every part,
    Some by ancient Persian devils,
    Others by a modern art.

    Where the terraced lawns lay dreaming,
    Underneath a cedar-tree
    Dozed an ancient, ancient person
    Tiny as a child of three.
    Every day a gobbling negro
    To his place the old man carried;
    Very feeble and exhausted
    Did he seem--but still he tarried.
    Then Hasan, the young lord, murmured,
    As he feasted in the taverns,
    "It is time to take my Father,
    I must bear him to the Caverns."

    So he took his long-maned pony,
    Her who wore the silver shoes,
    Galloped thro' the crowded highways
    Like one with no time to lose.
    Purpose in his warning outcry
    (Was he not the next of kin?)
    Till he reached his palace gateway,
    Flung the rein and fled within,
    Chose with care a wicker basket
    Very strong and deep and wide,
    Laying shawls of costliest texture
    And an eider quilt inside.

    Underneath the spreading cedar,
    In an arbour newly built,
    Found Hasan his ancient person,
    Put him underneath the quilt,
    Mounted then his long-maned pony
    With the basket on his arm,
    Carrying it very firmly
    Lest his father might take harm.
    Galloped thro' the crowded highway,
    Passing by the Street of Taverns,
    Fourteen leagues across the desert
    Till he came unto the Caverns.

    Fastened then his long-maned pony
    To a ring-post at the mouth
    (Scores and scores of ring-posts were there
    Where the Caverns faced the South)
    Plunged within the long wide gallery
    Tunnelled 'neath the rocky roof,
    With a lantern light exploring
    All the dark which lay aloof,
    Treading swiftly, treading surely,
    With the basket on his arm,
    Carrying it very firmly
    Lest his father might take harm.

    Till he came a byway unto
    Fashioned from another way,
    And a niche seen at the summit
    Of a guiding lantern ray.
    Lifted then the basket gently,
    Poised, and placed it in the niche,
    Saying "Farewell, ancient father,
    'Tis the custom" ... after which
    Bowed his head before his father
    Thrice, and swiftly turned to go,
    Knowing that it was the custom,
    Thinking it was better so.

    Suddenly he heard a droning,
    Like a gnat's small plaintive lay,
    Somewhere in the dark behind him
    Where the "Ancient Persons" lay,
    Heard a little ghostly twitter
    Like a voice addressing him,
    Turned and saw his father staring
    Just above the basket rim,
    Staring at Hasan, his strong son,
    With his filmy red-rimmed eyes,
    "What's ado, Oh! ancient father?"
    Cried Hasan in great surprise.

    "Son," replied the ancient person,
    "Tho' a miser is disgraced,
    Even in a wealthy household
    Monstrous is the crime of waste,
    Strong and shapely is the basket
    Much hath held and more will take;
    If you leave it in the Caverns
    Won't it be a great mistake?
    So, for once, let custom perish....
    Son, 'tis I, your father, ask it,
    Lift me out and lay me gently
    On the rock and ... take our basket."

    Oh! the young lord's wild amazement
    As he heard that tiny hum;
    Turned the lantern light behind him
    Stricken with amazement dumb.
    Oh! the young lord's vast confusion
    As its meaning gave a flicker--
    Oh! the mild iconoclastic
    Staring o'er the edge of wicker.
    Staring--staring--simply staring
    With his filmy red-rimmed eyes--
    Down Hasan his father lifted
    Silent still in strange surmise.

    Never faster had prince ridden
    From the place of Persian devils,
    Where its huge and inky bastions
    Frowned across the golden levels;
    Nor before had faster travelled
    Scion of the equine brood
    Than that day, that day of portent,
    Galloped she the silver-shoed.
    Saw Hasan the meaning clearly
    And a prophet (so they said)
    After sunset thro' the taverns
    Loud proclaimed the custom dead.

    This a legend of old Persia
    Of an earlier happier day
    Of a happy happy people--
    How they ended none can say.




    The Enchanted Gipsy.


    "Gilda, Gilda, my ragged child,
    Where have you been,
    In the lane, the green lane, or the heather,
    My little queen?"

    "Honey mother, sweet little mother,
    Oh! my old grey mummy,
    It's the blood of berries on my skirt
    Makes me look rummy."

    "There is no juice on your coral lips,
    Your amber eyes are wild,
    And why do you dance like an angry jay,
    My fairy child?"

    "I can tell, I can tell,
    Oh! my delicate mam,
    I dance to the tune of a blue-bell,
    Which told me what I am."

    "Gilda, Gilda, my lovely child,
    Say how it spoke,
    There is nothing well in a flower's spell
    On one of our folk."

    "Oh! my pet, my beautiful heart,
    Oh! my cunning mummy,
    My cousin the sun and the wind have begun,
    That's why I look rummy."

    "I have known one since I have begun,
    I have known a dozen,
    But never I knew a girl was true
    Who called _them_ cousin."

    "Oh! my mam, my delicate mam,
    Do not scold your daughter,
    I only went to the Witch's pool
    And looked in the water."

    "Oh! my dove, my beautiful elf,
    Was the water clear as heaven,
    Did you weave a crown of flowers for yourself,
    In the magic of even?"

    "Oh! my mother, my honey mother,
    The water was heaven-clear,
    I wove a crown of marigolds....
    But why do you look so queer?"

    "Oh! my girl, my pitiful girl,
    Good-bye to your happy hours,
    The Curse of the Pool is on you....
    Your ways are not ours."




    The Roof of the World.


    "Ere the first blush of morning's rose
    Had reddened the eternal snows,
    I plunged the pines among,
    And came down thro' the forest sons
    In their deep-ranked battalions
    With practised steps and strong.

    "Then heard I from the plateau rock
    A lowing cow and a crowing cock--
    Thin sounds in upper air.
    And far below at the valley's end
    I saw the morning smoke ascend
    That showed me men were there.

    "Ho! you lads, arouse, arouse!
    He is descended to your house
    Of whom wild legend ran.
    On the roof of the world I dwelt five year,
    Go, tell your master I am here
    To be his serving-man.

    "Ho! all you folk, I climbed above
    The boundaries of hate and love.
    Ho! such an one was I--
    The wind it whistled to my bone.
    I was alone, alone, alone
    With the mountains and the sky.

    "It is a timeless land and still;
    The heavens slowly like a wheel
    Revolve themselves around;
    There are two rulers in that place;
    Eternity sits throned by space;
    Their law is without sound.

    "Ho! you folk, such feats I did
    On the world's roof the snow amid,
    Ho! such an one as I--
    I matched the wild goat in my race,
    And underneath the long wise face
    I pulled the beard awry.

    "Five years I sported undismayed,
    But suddenly I was afraid,
    Yea, fearfully amazed.
    I saw the eye of a dying hare;
    Infinity was mirrored there
    Ere it was wholly glazed.

    "And this shall be my daily good,
    To draw your water, hew your wood,
    And lighten all your need;
    To do your sowing and your tilling;
    But to be bright and always willing,
    And have no other creed."

    All bronzed and bearded was his face;
    He had a rapture and a grace
    From living in the wild;
    As he stared around and strangely spoke
    He looked not like other folk,
    But as an eager child.




    The Poet and the Lily.


    A poet was born in a modern time,
    'Neath Saturn and his Rings,
    He was a child of the world's prime,
    Knew all beautiful things.
    He was a child of morning and mirth,
    Laughing for joy of the sun,
    His nostrils drank the scent of earth
    When rain is over and done.

    A lily came from the winter's womb
    And grew in its own sweet pride,
    But the ruthless steel passed over its bloom,
    And low in the dust it died.
    And the poet's heart was filled with pain
    That a delicate thing and rare
    Should be reft of the beauty of which it was fain
    And killed by the cruel share.

    So he sang of the meadows white with lambs,
    And life all young again,
    Of the colts which gallop to their dams,
    Knowing not any rein.
    He sang of the spring upon the sea,
    Hedges all white with may,
    The year in its sweet infancy,
    This our great world at play.

    Of shepherds piping to their flocks
    Across the fields of thyme,
    Of sunlit fields above the rocks,
    Where the small waves lap in rhyme.
    Of glancing maids and youths their peers,
    For ever young and free,
    With faces fair, and in their ears
    Great music of the sea.

    He sang the amber moon a-sail
    In an even of misty blue,
    The stars which burn, the stars which pale,
    The might which holds them true;
    The comets in another sky
    Which sweep to an unknown morn.
    He sang of some vast agony
    Or ever a world was born.

    He sang a song like a twanging bow,
    His head was full of sound
    As a dark night when winds are low
    And a swell comes from the ground.
    He sang a song like a joyous bird
    In wooded places and hilly,
    While in the hearts of those that heard
    Pity grew like a lily.




    The Tramp.


    Forth from the ill-lit tavern door
    Where he had snoozed and boozed before
    Stumbled his shambling feet.
    A candle gave a guttering light,
    And some one growled a hoarse good-night....
    The Tramp was in the street.

    His boots were blistered, burst and patched,
    He had a mildewed hat, which matched
    His green, unlovely coat.
    Once, too, he caught his foot and swore,
    And, tho' the night was warm, he wore
    A muffler at his throat.

    And as he went his two lips moved
    As if he muttered songs he loved
    To an old, unquiet tune;
    And as he went his eyes were glazed,
    Twice, too, he paused like some one dazed
    And hiccoughed at the moon.

    Thus thro' the empty ways he passed
    Until he reached the road at last
    With fields at either hand,
    And in the heavens bare and bright
    The moon stood high and shed her light
    Upon the silent land.

    And lo! hard by, a lofty rick,
    No chance was there of stab or prick,
    It makes a pleasant bed.
    And so, within, he burrowed deep,
    And then upon a fragrant heap
    He laid his unclean head.

    The moon was swallowed by a cloud,
    A nightingale sang sweet and loud
    From the middle of a wood;
    From its small body swelled a strain
    Which flooded all the listening plain.
    It trembled as it stood.

    Upon his hay the Tramp awoke,
    The golden fountain never broke,
    The lovely sobbing strain.
    The melody of that brown bird
    Awoke a delicate, prisoned chord
    Within his sodden brain.

    The brain of him who lived remote
    And dreamed strange things he never wrote
    But hoarded in his mind.
    He would not kill the dreams he loved
    For sake of little things that moved
    The passions of mankind.

    Let the red torches toss and flare,
    And all the long-stemmed trumpets blare,
    Let brass beat loud on brass.
    Let the Kings ride in victory,
    Low comes the thought amidst the cry,
    "These visions shall but pass."

    For, like reflections in a mirror,
    Or empty bubbles on a river,
    The striving world passed by.
    What seemed to others worth the winning
    Thro' strong desire or hate of sinning
    Brought him no energy.

    The thunder muttering on the hills,
    The song of birds, the babbling rills,
    The painted flowers and stars,
    This pageantry of earth did seem
    The parcel of a timeless dream.
    He lived beyond the bars.

    It was to him a vague mirage
    Or memory of a storied page
    With only that appeal;
    But oftentimes a sound or sight
    Would bring to him his own delight
    More subtle than the real.

    And with his sense of entity
    Half lost, he raised a vacant eye
    Into the empyrean.
    And as he lay upon his back
    The pealing centuries rolled back....
    He saw the blue AEgean.

    And thus he dreamt: "My palace home
    With minaret and marble dome
    Upon the sapphire strait.
    My garden full of nightingales,
    One singing as the other fails
    While evening groweth late.

    "And from my watch-tower I behold
    Beneath a sky of molten gold
    My argosies return.
    A homeward wind is in their sails,
    Freighted are they with costly bales,
    Vast fires behind them burn.

    "I have a room with shining floors
    And lofty roof and polished doors,
    Wherein I love to dine
    With two good friends at left and right,
    Whose converse is my soul's delight
    And glads my heart like wine.

    "Or in my marble portico
    We sit and watch the summer glow
    And talk of love and death;
    And when the amber twilight fails
    We listen to the nightingales,
    And evening holds her breath.

    "Oh! Charicles and Charmides,
    Much have I dreamt of hours like these,
    My friends I never knew--
    Whose voices and whose grave, sweet words
    Were lovelier than the songs of birds,
    And fresher than the dew.

    "For Charicles has love and youth,
    And all his words are sweet with truth,
    Like a garden with the rain;
    And Charmides is mild and wise,
    But with his tear-washed, violet eyes
    Yet can he smile again.

    "Perhaps I knew you, ancient lords
    Of nobler wit and finer chords--
    But this I cannot tell;
    For ever lovely things I sought
    In some strange borderland of thought,
    Content therein to dwell.

    "For who could blame or who could praise
    If one should choose to pass his days
    In a phantasy of dreams,
    And, finding thus his own ideal
    In things dissevered from the real,
    Be happier than he seems?

    "Ah! who could praise or who could blame,
    Tho' glimmers all my way the same,
    Like a dyke-road thro' a fen.
    Far on, far on--a ruddy spark--
    The toll-light glows adown the dark,
    And I, like other men,

    "Must pay my toll and pass beyond,--
    I made no vow, I signed no bond,
    Nor lose my self-esteem,
    But pass, unknown, unloved, unlost,
    The man who knew and weighed the cost,
    The man who dared to dream.

    "For what is Fame and what's a Name,
    Your cries of sorrow, wrath, and shame,
    Your Hamlets and King Lears,
    The night must cover them again
    Did they last a thousand lives of men,
    A thousand thousand years.

    "The world may say that I have missed;
    Ah! no--I am an egoist
    Of subtle, fixed design.
    My dreams a garden are to me
    To which no other holds the key,
    I wish to keep them mine.

    "All mine--those tender, half-thought things,
    Which flutter gossamer rainbow wings
    And hover near, near, near.
    Why should I catch and pin them down
    And lose their beauty for a crown
    Would chafe my brows to wear.

    "And thus, a baser alchemist
    In some perverted plan persist
    To turn my gold to dross.
    If I turned my gold their soul were sold
    Tho' I wore a crown and cloth of gold,
    Their soul were then the loss.

    "If I sat high, a crowned king,
    With lofty brows in a royal ring,
    A lustrous diadem,
    If I wore the titles 'High, Strong, and Wise,'
    And garments stained with purple dyes,
    All jewelled at the hem

    "With emeralds, rubies and jacinth stones,
    Such as great kings wear on their golden thrones,
    And a royal mantle of vair,
    And held a sceptre in my hand,
    Which showed me ruler of all the land,
    In my palace, where none might dare

    "To cross my word, but all must bow
    As the courtly throng are bending now,
    And give the King his meed,
    And slaves waved forests of peacock fans
    And a cry went up like a single man's,
    'This is the King indeed.'

    "For I could be King and Overlord
    In the wondrous realm of the written word,
    Am King there ... in my dreams.
    So, loving dreams, this life I choose--
    The tramp's with tattered coat and shoes,
    Yet happier than it seems.

    "Thus, oh! my dreams, you grow not old,
    No process dims you, leaves you cold,
    Immortal, bright, you come,
    And if you come not, I am wise,
    I have my trusted old allies,
    Tobacco, beer, and rum."

    His chin sank down upon his breast,
    And suddenly the brown bird ceased
    To pour her strain abroad.
    A sound less sweet to mortal ear
    Uprose (had one been there to hear)....
    It was the tramp who snored.




    The Black Dwarf.


    Certain it is that of those qualities
    We are enamoured which we most do lack.
    So he, fantastic out of human guise,
    Bent, broken, bowed, small, apish, humped of back,
    Marred in the mint, perfection's contrary,
    To sweet perfection found his marred life thrall,
    And--the great artist without jealousy--
    Knew beauty more than all.

    Much he loved flowers and their frail loveliness,
    But if they pined thro' blight or thirsty want,
    Or spiteful wind had made his blossoms less,
    Or mouse or mole had gnawed some tender plant,
    Then seemed the edge of life all dull and blunt,
    And passion thwarted tore his twisted frame,
    And, 'neath the penthouse of the shaggy front,
    The yellow eyes flashed flame.

    But most he joyed whenever country maid,
    Prizing his taste, or damsel highly born
    To judgment came, and anxiously displayed
    For him submission as for others scorn.
    Then, peering keenly from his peat-roofed home,
    Calm in his power he scanned her as he chose,
    And, if she pleased, the swart and twisted gnome
    Gave her a white, white rose.




    To an Elephant.


    Lord of the trunk and fan-like ears,
    Wisest and mightiest next to man,
    I see thee hence a million years
    Ruling the earth with milder plan.
    Dwellers above, beneath the ground,
    Shall live contented in that time;
    No subtle growths shall e'er confound
    Their natural joy and instinct prime.

    Not such as those who planned to nought
    And groped (wise fools!) beyond their ken
    Scarce knowing what they loved or sought--
    Those subtle growths, those weary men--
    Shall dwell earth's inexperienced brood
    In natural joy and instinct prime;
    But without evil, without good,
    Be each new moment, not all time.

    Jungles shall grow where cities stood,
    The mighty rivers roar unbridged
    The hungry tiger seek his food,
    Save for thy bidding, privileged,
    Where (weary subtle growths) we bore
    Our burden of humanity;
    For conscious mind shall work no more
    And man himself have ceased to be.




SONGS.




    The Palmer's Song.


    I will fling ambition away
    Like a vain and glittering toy;
    With tristful weeping will I pray
    And wash my sin's alloy.
    I will wear the palmer's weed
    And walk in the sandal shoon.
    I will walk in the sun by day
    And sleep beneath the moon.
    I will set forth as the bells toll
    And travel to the East,
    Because of a sin upon my soul
    And the chiding of a priest.




    The Song of the Old Men.


    We are the old, old men,
    Once fierce and high-hearted in frolics,
    But now we are three score and ten
    Or upwards--mere relics
    Of the fine strong pageant of youth,
    Which time in his spite and unruth
    Has taken.
    We are dim and palsied and shaken,
    Ah! me--forsaken.

    Where are the fair white maids
    With flower faces and carriage
    Straight as new-smithied blades,
    Ripe, ready for marriage?
    Now all are withered and grey,
    Their beauty has passed away,
    Ah! madness--
    They are bent like hoops with sadness
    And the world's badness.

    Our voices are hoarse and drear,
    As we sit and mumble together,
    We have no good tidings to hear
    We had sooner have never
    (So we grumble together) been born,
    That are so sick and forlorn;
    Just shadows--
    But once bright fishers of shallows,
    Swift hunters of meadows.

    We are the old, old men,
    We have seen and endured much trouble;
    It has turned us children again,
    And bent us double.
    Now we sit like a circle of stones,
    And hear in each others' moans
    Ill token.
    For our sweetest thoughts were broken
    Or else unspoken.




    The Song of Snorro.


    "Oh! who can drink at the world's brink,
    Or reach the twilight star?
    It's a long sail where the winds wail,
    And the great waters are.

    "Or who can say at the parting day
    That he will see once more
    His children's faces in happy places,
    His true wife at the door?"

    Snorro the Viking, his thigh striking,
    Laughed in his big red beard.
    "Some are bound by sight and sound.
    While some have wished and feared.

    "Their days dream as a droning stream
    Or moonlight in a wood.
    Now who can sate his love or hate,
    And the tumult of his blood?

    "Then cast the die for the open sky
    When the great sun beats abroad,
    For the foam-fleck and the narrow deck,
    The life of oar and sword.

    "Life and limb for the wind's hymn,
    And all the fears that be,
    The ghost-races with ghastly faces,
    The phantoms of the sea.

    "Mine is the morrow," shouted Snorro,
    "I longed and have not feared."
    And his great laughter followed after
    And rumbled in his beard.




    The Island.


    Once (was it long ago, dear?
    Oh! hark to the sighing seas.)
    We sailed to a wonderful Island
    In the golden Antipodes,
    Where the waves wore an azure mantle,
    The winds were ever at rest,
    For we'd left the Old World behind us
    A thousand leagues to the West.

    We came to that wonderful Island;
    Girt by a ring of foam
    It lay in the sea like a jewel
    Under an azure dome.
    The cliffs were all gold in the sunlight,
    The strand was a floor of gold,
    So we knew we'd come to the Island
    We'd read of in tales of old.

    Was it long we stayed in our Island?
    (Dear, I can never say)
    I know we walked on the mountains
    Which looked far over the bay.
    I know that we laughed for pleasure
    (Were we wise or a couple of fools?)
    As we gazed at the painted fishes
    Which swam in the shallow pools.

    And night drew over our Island
    The purple pall of the skies,
    The air was heavy with fragrance
    And soft with the breath of sighs,
    And voices out of the forest,
    Voices out of the sea,
    Told the eternal secret....
    Told it to you and me.

    And the stars came down from the heavens,
    And the magical tropic moon,
    To dance a measure together
    Over the still lagoon;
    And the whisper of distant forests,
    The noise of the surf in our ears,
    Seemed like the song of the ages
    Sung by the passing years.

    But we said "farewell" to our Island
    Which we had discovered alone....
    The sand ... and the palms ... and the headland....
    The westering wind ... and the sun.
    We said "farewell" to our Island
    (Oh! hark to the sullen rain!)
    ... And I knew as it fell behind us
    We should not see it again.

    For only a few may go there
    And they but once may go,
    With glamour of stars above them
    And the swinging seas below.
    But I still hear its forests whisper,
    The noise of the surf on the shore,
    In that far-off wonderful Island
    Which I shall see no more.




    Fair Filamelle.


    Fair Filamelle is my distress
    With all her cruel backwardness.
    She will not listen to my pain,
    But turneth from me in disdain.
    That fair Filamelle,
    Her disdain is now my hell.
    She hath bewitched me with her eyes,
    As Circe did the sailor wise,
    Or Egypt did the Roman Prince,
    Two thousand years agone.
    I've little else but weeping since,
    My heart is like a stone.

    If you like laughter's silver sound
    Why have you dealt me such a wound,
    If youth and beauty look askance
    At glum and heavy countenance,
    Why is it coy and cruel,
    Adding to my fire more fuel?
    Alas! Alas! it has no care,
    Free as the birds which flit in air,
    Nor heedfulness has any,
    Else were its kindness not so rare,
    Its victims then so many.

    Ah! fair Filamelle, have pity on my moan,
    Else must I die alone,
    My heart is like a stone.




    The Song of Kisses.


    I have no skill in Love's soft war,
    Nor am I bold to woo
    In the same sort that conquerors are
    When they are lovers too.
    Tho' passion thunders in my brain
    Like ocean on a beach,
    My tongue is bounden with a chain
    And manacled my speech.
    Yet, could I let one word go free
    To touch your chords with fire,
    Become the wind upon the sea
    The plectrum of the lyre,
    Then, my Althea, should we be
    Two lovers without shame,
    All things in their epitome,
    The Universe our name.
    Then should we bow to Love's command
    As the waves kiss the shore
    And the rain falls upon the land
    That it may thirst no more.
    Then should we kiss, with time at bay
    As in the Ajalon valley,
    A score--two score--two hundred--nay
    We would not keep the tally--
    A hundred thousand in one bout,
    Ten myriads ere we slumbered,
    And the stars winked and all went out
    To find themselves out-numbered.




    The Song of Odysseus.


    Out of the dark I return--
    The abode of the shades;
    The words which they said
    Were the strengthless words of the Dead,
    Meaningless, nothing importing.

    Out of the dark I return
    And the House of the Dead;
    The endless regions of gloom
    Deep sepulchred in the womb
    Of Earth, the mother of all things.

    Out of the dark I return,
    From the stream of the Dead;
    I slew a goat on the brink
    And they pressed around me to drink
    Their shadowy twittering legions.

    Out of the dark I return,
    From the speech of the Dead;
    I asked them for counsel and word,
    They twittered like bats when they heard
    And wailed for the warm blood flowing.

    Out of the dark I return;
    (Ye are baffled, Oh! Dead);
    Lost hopes, lost hearts, lost loves,
    Hollow-eyed, hollow-cheeked are your droves,
    I drew my sword and ye vanished.

    Out of the dark I return
    And the dust of desire;
    My ears are still filled with the shrieks
    Of the pitiful Dead and my cheeks
    Still pale with the paleness of Hades.

    Out of the dark I return
    For the day, for the deed;
    And now to Apollo, the slayer,
    I stand and utter a prayer
    Humbly, first making obeisance.




STORIES IN VERSE.




    Adeimantus.


    The dream of Adeimantus
    Who carved for a Grecian Prince
    Statues of perfect marble,
    Fairer than all things since,
    Wonderful, white, and gracious
    Like lotus flowers on a mere,
    Or phantoms born of the moonbeam,
    Beyond all praise but a tear.
    The dream of Adeimantus
    (As he lay upon his bed),
    Wonderful, white, and gracious,
    And this was the word it said.
    "Arise! oh! Adeimantus,
    The breath of the dawn blows chill,
    The stars begin to fade
    Ere the first ray strikes the sill.
    Arise! oh! Adeimantus
    For here is work to your hand,
    If the fingers fashion the dream
    As the soul can understand."
    He rose from his troubled bed
    Ere the dream had faded away,
    And he said, "I will fashion the dream
    As the potter fashions the clay."
    He said in his great heart's vanity,
    "I will fashion a wondrous thing
    To stand in a palace of onyx
    And blind the eyes of a king."
    He said in the pride of his soul
    As the birds began to sing,
    "I will surely take no rest
    Till I fashion this wondrous thing.
    I will swear an oath to eschew
    The white wine and the red,
    To eat no delicate meats
    Nor break the fair, white bread.
    I will not walk in the city
    But labour here alone
    In the dew and the dusk and the flush
    Till the vision smiles from the stone."
    Six days he wrought at the marble,
    But cunning had left his hand,
    And his fingers would not fashion
    What his soul could understand.
    Six days he fasted and travailed,
    Hard was the watch to keep,
    So the chisel fell from his fingers
    And he sank with a sob to sleep.
    But a vision came to his slumber
    Beautiful as before,
    Floating in with the moonbeam
    Gliding over the floor.
    It floated in with the moonbeam
    And stood beside his bed,
    Wonderful, white, and gracious,
    And this was the word it said.
    "Courage, oh! Adeimantus,
    I am the perfect thing
    To stand in a shrine of jasper
    And blind the eyes of a king.
    I am the strange desire,
    The glory beyond the dream,
    The passion above the song,
    The spirit-light of the gleam.
    I come to my best beloved,
    Not actual, from afar,
    Fairer than hope or thought,
    More beautiful than a star.
    Courage, oh! Adeimantus,
    Lay strength and strength to your soul.
    You shall fashion surely a part
    Tho' you may not grasp the whole."




    Pygmalion.


    Once ... I seem to remember....
    Crept in the noonday heat
    A boy with a crooked shadow
    Which capered along the street.
    A boy whose shadow was mocked at
    By the children passing along,
    Straight and tall and beautiful,
    Happy with laughter and song.
    So, he envied their beauty....
    He who was crooked and brown....
    The strong youths of the mountain,
    The white girls of the town,
    Envied their happy meetings
    And the tender words they spoke
    In the shadow of the temples,
    Under the groves of oak.
    And his lonely heart was stricken
    That never his lot might be
    To walk with a maid who loved him....
    So quaint and crooked was he.


    II

    Thus was my heart once stricken
    And I repined for a while,
    I but a boy in years,
    Who longed for a maiden's smile.
    Till once on a day in summer
    My soul was touched with a gleam,
    And I woke from my morbid fancies
    Like one from an evil dream,
    And knew that the gods in their wisdom
    Had made and set me apart.
    Lean, misshapen, and ugly....
    No toy for a maiden's heart.
    And I felt with a heart awakened
    That leapt in a riot of joy,
    The heart of a wise man and proud
    Not the heart of a moody boy.
    Viewing the old things anew
    With an inner wonder in each:
    The cloud ships driven thro' heaven,
    The sea rolling into the beach,
    The magic heart of the woodland,
    The loves of nymph and faun,
    The splendour of starlight nights,
    The calm inviolate dawn.


    III

    Thus was my spirit quickened,
    And once on a lucky day
    I drew a bird on plaster,
    And modelled a horse in clay;
    Kneeling under a wall
    Where a shadow fell on the street,
    Eyes and mind intent
    In the midst of the noonday heat.
    Eyes and mind intent....
    And a stranger passed my way,
    ... The shadow grew and lengthened
    As he stopped to watch my play.
    He looked at the little horse,
    He looked at the winging bird;
    And ere I noticed his presence
    He touched me and spoke a word:
    "Hast thou the mind and will
    As thou hast hand and sight...?
    Follow me if thou hast
    And climb ... oh! climb to the height."


    IV

    So I followed him to his workshop
    And stayed there a year and a year
    Working under a master
    Who praised me and held me dear,
    Till at last a day arose
    When, taking my hand in his own,
    "You have my knowledge," he said,
    "And now you must stand alone."
    And tho' I sorrowed to leave him
    My heart was ready to sing,
    So first in praise of the gods
    I made for an offering
    (Even as does a shepherd
    His rustic altar of sods)
    Bright forms larger than human
    As mortals dream of the gods.
    Then, in my strange world-worship,
    The Tritons, Lords of the Sea,
    The creatures which haunt the woodland,
    Happy and shy and free,
    Nymphs and satyrs and fauns
    Who worship the great god Pan,
    And lastly the mighty heroes
    Who fashion the mind of man.


    V

    Thus thought I and thus wrought I,
    And my power grew greater still.
    I rose to the heights of passion
    And sounded the depths of will,
    Reaching out to the farthest
    Winnowing down to the last,
    Gazing into the future
    And diving into the past.
    Higher and ever higher
    Like an eagle soared my art
    And I praised the most high gods
    Who made and set me apart.
    And Prince and poet and painter
    Travelled to touch my hand,
    The minds which had toiled and suffered,
    The minds which could understand,
    Marvelling in my workshop
    At the shining forms they saw....
    The children of my spirit
    Born of a higher law.


    VI

    But last on a day in summer
    (An evil day it seems)
    I thought, "I will fashion a woman
    As I have seen in dreams.
    I, who never loved woman
    That breathed and spoke and moved,
    Will fashion a noble statue
    To show what I could have loved;
    A glorious naked figure
    Untouched by time or fate,
    A symbol of all that might be
    And she shall be my mate.
    Not mate of my crooked body,
    Lean, misshapen and brown,
    (No longer I feared my shadow
    But walked a prince in the town)
    But mate for my glorious spirit
    Winging thro' shimmering heights,
    On the viewless pinions of fancy
    Where none can follow its flights."
    Thus was I moved in spirit
    And wrought, a happy slave,
    Striving to make the best
    Of the gifts the high gods gave,
    Fashioning out of the marble,
    --And I knew my work was good--
    The arms and the breasts and the thighs
    And the glory of womanhood.


    VII

    Lo! the statue is finished.
    Look how it stands serene
    A woman with tender smile
    And proud eyes of a queen!
    Lo! the statue is perfect....
    Flower and crown of my life....
    I who never loved woman
    Could take this woman for wife....
    Her, my Galatea,
    My wonderful milk-white friend,
    Work of my hand and brain
    Linked to this noble end.


    VIII

    The statue stands above me,
    Flower and crown of my art....
    But would that the gods had made me
    As others, not set me apart.
    For what, in the measure of life,
    Is work on a lower plane?
    And this the finest, brightest--
    Further I cannot attain.
    Shall I grind its beauty to fragments
    Or shatter its symmetry?--
    For I have made it in secret
    And none has seen it but me.
    My hand would falter and fail--
    Oh! ... I could not forget.
    I still should see it in dreams
    With a passion of regret.
    Or ... Shall I wait till morning
    White-winged over the land,
    Ere the fishermen tramp the beach
    And drag their boats to the sand;
    And find at last ... oh! at last
    A boon denied to me,
    Rest in the ever-restless,
    The huge, unquiet sea,
    That the brain may be freed from toil
    Which has toiled to a luckless end
    When it touched its highest powers
    And shaped my milk-white friend.


    IX

    For a dream is only a dream,
    (My best and my last stands there)
    And a stone is only a stone,
    Be it carven beyond compare,
    And the veriest hind of the field
    Who sweats for his hungry brood,
    Has a deeper knowledge than I
    Of our mortal evil and good.
    Oh! gods, if ever I sought you,
    And found you, terrible lords,
    Zeus in the rattling thunder,
    Ares in din of swords;
    And thou, wise grey-eyed lady,
    Who lovest the sober mean,
    Reason and grave discourses,
    A tempered mind and serene,
    You have I duly honoured--
    Yet one have I kept apart,
    (Lean, misshapen, and ugly
    No toy for a maiden's heart).
    "Oh! foam-begotten and smiling,
    Oh, perilous child of the sea--
    Forgive--ere too late--and befriend me!
    What am I--what is life without thee?"
    And his prayer went up like a vapour
    To the palace above the snows,
    Where the shining gods held revel,
    And deathless laughter arose.
    But Hupnos swiftly descended
    Like a noiseless bird of the night
    And brushed his eyes with pinions
    Downy and thick and light,
    Circled dimly about him,
    And brushed his eyes as he prayed
    Laying a drowsy mandate,
    And the watcher drooped and obeyed.


    X

    In at the workshop windows
    Peacefully stole the dawn;
    Tinting the marble figures
    Of wood-nymph, goddess and faun,
    Broadening in a streamer
    Which touched with a rosy glow
    The still white form of the statue,
    The sleeper kneeling below.
    ... She moved as the red light touched her
    And life stirred under her hair,
    A little shiver ran over
    Her glorious limbs all bare.
    Thro' arms and breasts and thighs
    The warm blood pulsed and ran:
    And she stepped down from the pedestal--
    A woman unto a man;
    Saying in tender accents
    Of low and musical tone:
    "Oh! sleeper, wake from thy slumber
    No longer art thou alone...."




    Alexis.


    Who slew Alexis? Some one smote
    Right thro' the white and tender throat
    (And scarce gave time for fear)
    The jewelled doll, who sprang from kings,
    With farded cheek and flashing rings,
    And left him lying here.

    He sat upon a throne, pardye,
    The ancient throne of Muscovy,
    Smiling a harlot's smile,
    And gave--the painted popinjay--
    The word which no man might gainsay,
    Tossing his curls the while.

    And savage warriors, steel on hips,
    Muttered between their bearded lips,
    And spat upon the floor,
    To see a thing so debonnaire
    Enthroned upon a conqueror's chair,
    And find their King half-whore.

    Or in a gallery all aflare,
    Approached by some dark palace stair,
    He lay in languid mood,
    And naked women, mad with wine,
    Did cruelty and lust combine
    To stir his tainted blood.

    So plunged, half woman and half devil,
    In many a foul and roaring revel,
    By some fierce craving fanned,
    Alexis, with the girlish face
    And swaying movements full of grace,
    The Ruler of this Land.

    So, hunted by a mind diseased,
    By those fierce orgies unappeased,
    He thirsted after new;
    And monstrous things he did (they say)
    Which never saw the light of day,
    Shared by a chosen few.

    The rocks were cleft to bring him treasure,
    The mothers mourned to give him pleasure,
    The whole land writhed in pain,
    All night the secret chambers flared,
    All night the horrid deeds were dared
    Which made him thirst again.

    And pampered Turks lived by his side,
    With gobbling negroes bloodshot-eyed,
    And hags with mouths impure.
    And day and night the warders tall
    Stood watching on his castle wall
    That he might dwell secure.

    Strange visions did upon him throng
    With shapes confused which held him long,
    A riot in his brain.
    Unbridled lust, unbounded power
    So worked upon him in that hour....
    I think he was insane.

    And I--who had no God to please,
    And nursed him crowing on my knees--
    I waited by the stair,
    And as he gave a joyous note,
    Passed this bright iron thro' his throat
    And left him lying there.




    The King's Cloak.


    There was a King in Norroway
    Who loved a famous sport,
    He followed it in the sun and snow
    With the nobles of his Court.
    In all his kingdom mountainous
    Was none so swift as he
    (For so they said who ate his bread)
    At running on the ski.

    His black heart swelled with pride
    As the acorn swells with the tree,
    And from all his kingdom mountainous
    He called the men of the ski.
    From fir-pricked crag and gloomy gorge
    Where the lonely log-huts cling,
    And till the King's word bade them cease
    They raced before the King.

    So raced they down a spear-broad track,
    Where never tree did grow,
    Between the mountains and the sea
    A thousand feet below
    Till sundip in a cold pearl sky
    And a west of ageless pink
    From a withered pine to the King enthroned
    With his nobles by the brink.

    There ran one with the racers
    Straight-fashioned as a sword,
    With sail-brown cheek and eyes as deep
    As water in a fiord
    And till the King's word bade them cease
    None passed or touched him near,
    He leapt as frightened chamois leap
    And ran like a stricken deer.

    Dusk threw a hateful shadow
    On the King's countenance
    "The guerdons of thy skill," cried he,
    "Or, boy, thy luck, perchance?
    This figured ivory drinking horn!
    This turquoise-hilted sword!
    But ... shall I see no marvel
    Ere day dips in the fiord?"

    "There is not in fair Norroway
    My master on the ski
    One bolder or more skilful....
    A marvel wouldst thou see?"
    --Bold and high was the answer--
    "'Twas skill not luck, Oh! King,
    I am the swiftest.... A marvel
    Of whom the scalds shall sing."

    "Oh! yonder stand the mountains
    And yonder moans the sea
    And he who leapt from the topmost crag....
    A bold man would he be.
    A bold man ... yea, a marvel
    For the grey-haired scalds to hymn...."
    Day dying touched his swarthy cheek
    With a lurid light and grim,

    While he made the gloomy challenge
    And round a murmur ran,
    But ... the boy bowed low and answered,
    "Oh! King, behold the man
    The swiftest and the boldest
    In thy kingdom by the sea,
    From mountain or ... from hatred
    What man can do, dares he."

    ... He swept down from the mountain
    Like an eaglet on a hare
    With bent back and swinging arms
    And tossing golden hair....
    The King stood by the precipice
    (A small sea moaned and broke)
    ... Looked down over the wrinkled sea
    And swiftly loosed his cloak.

    ... He came as an arrow is loosened....
    As a slinger slings a stone,
    Clutched (as the sun shot downwards)
    At one on the brink alone....
    The King leapt back ... the King laughed out....
    The great cloak floated free....
    There came no sound--tho' he listened long--
    From the darkened moaning sea.




    The Knight and the Witch.


    A voice cried over the Hills
    "Follow the strange desire.
    Oh! follow, follow, follow,
    The world is on fire.
    Day burns on funeral bed
    In flame of sky and sea,
    And, black against that red,
    Is the tower where dwelleth she
    And gazeth, white foot pressed
    On bruised heaps of bloom,
    O'er the sea which cannot rest
    And sounds thro' her room.
    Murmurs in her room
    Thro' a casement open wide
    The sea which is a tomb
    For mariners of pride.
    Oh! follow, follow, follow,
    Come quickly unto her,
    Her body is more sweet
    Than cassia or myrrh,
    She is whiter than the moon,
    She is stranger than death,
    Stronger than the new moon
    Which the waters draweth.
    More lovely are her words
    More lovely is she
    Than the flight of white birds
    O'er a halcyon sea.
    She took the stars for toys--
    Her magic was so strong--
    Murmurs of earth and the noise
    Of green seas for a song.
    She leant down on the sill
    And called across the sea.
    ... Oh! follow, follow, follow,
    Come quickly unto me...."
    A voice cried over the Hills
    "Oh! come, I fail, I swoon,
    Pale with my love's excess,
    Paler than our pale moon.
    Oh! come, Oh! come, Oh! come,
    Before the days eclipse
    We'll meet with brimming eyes
    And kiss with quivering lips.
    Love-drunken, breast to breast,
    With half-closed eyes we'll kiss,
    And reel from bliss to pain
    From pain again to bliss.
    The sea which cannot rest
    From its undernote of doom
    (We swooning breast on breast)
    Shall murmur thro' my room.
    Shall murmur all night long
    Thro' a casement open wide.
    The sea, which is a tomb
    For mariners of pride,
    With an undernote of doom
    Shall murmur evermore
    That love is in the room
    And Death is at the door,
    That Death will bruise to dust
    Our flower-drenched passion soon
    Darker than darkest night
    Colder than our cold moon.
    So shall it ebb and flow
    Our love like those sea-tides
    For a space ... a little space--
    What matter? ... nought abides."

    A voice cried over the Hills,
    "What matter? ... all things die,
    Our quivering love's excess,
    Our rose-drenched ecstasy
    As glimmering waters drawn
    By the magic of the moon,
    As the moon itself at dawn
    Our love shall vanish soon.
    So swift (my love-pale groom)
    A white bird wings its flight.
    Then find you Death's cold room,
    Darker than darkest night;
    Then find you that dark door
    (And find it all men must)
    And love there nevermore
    But crumble back to dust,
    And kiss there nevermore
    In flower-drenched ecstasy;
    Too late then to implore,
    Too cold to hear a cry."

    And then towards the shelving beach
    A cedar shallop drew,
    With silver prow shaped like a swan
    And sails of rainbow hue.
    Swiftly it came with a wake of foam
    And lying on its side
    Like an arrow's flight towards the Knight,
    Tho' none sat there to guide.
    And in the shallows by the shore
    It came to rest at last,
    The cordage slacked and the rainbow sail
    Flapped idly on the mast.
    And the Swan-prow with the ruby eyes
    Opened his silver beak,
    And with a musical, magic voice
    He thus began to speak.
    "Step in, step in, my gallant lad,
    Your youth shall be my fare.
    For you my mistress opes her door
    And combs her wine-dark hair.
    She swelled my sail with an eager wind
    And drove me to this beach,
    She gave strange sight to my ruby eyes
    And filled my beak with speech.

    "She saw you in the magic glass
    The hour that she has might,
    As you rode across the purple heath,
    Honour and armour bright.
    Step in, step in, my lover bold
    And come to the West with me
    Where the young nymphs play in the wave and lift
    Their white arms from the sea;
    And the Tritons chase the laughing rout
    And swim by the vessel's side,
    Blowing on horns confusedly,
    Or shouting words of pride.
    You hear it now, but the time will come
    When you shall hear no more
    The ceaseless wash of a dreaming sea,
    Its ripples on the shore.
    Oh! follow, follow the sinking sun
    And the great white Evening Star,
    A magic wind shall breathe behind
    Our sail, and bear us far."

    He doffed his red-plumed casque of steel,
    All flaxen was his hair,
    And he was clad from throat to heel
    In the armour princes wear,
    From throat to heel in silver mail
    Like a shining prince in a fairy-tale.

    The witch Hegertha o'er him bent,
    (Ah! God, her face was fair)
    Her breath blew on him like a scent,
    She touched him with her hair.
    There was no stronger witch than this,
    And she gave the Knight her first kiss.
    And he was bound to her sword and hand,
    To do whatever she might command.

    Then up to her full height she drew,
    Down poured her hair like wine,
    Her pale, proud face looked sadly through
    --A moon in a wood of pine--
    She breathed a spell in a low, sweet tone
    Which none of woman born could disown.
    And he was bound to her side till death
    By the spell just uttered above her breath.

    She drew his soul forth with her eyes,
    As a drinker slakes his drouth,
    A little smile played sorrowful, wise,
    About her rose-red mouth.
    She stooped down and called his soul forth,
    And left him naught but his body's earth.
    And he was bound to her evermore
    By the soul he lost and the word he swore.

    For evermore and evermore
    In the chamber by the sea,
    Till death should break the spell-bound door
    And end his slavery;
    In the chamber strewn with flowers in bloom
    With a heavy scent like death,
    Echoing ever the song of doom
    Which the sad sea moaned beneath.
    For evermore and evermore
    Till life ceased in his side,
    Bound to the room and the rose-strewn floor
    And the strange, unholy bride.

    And naught could save him now, when once the spell
    Had fallen on him, binding limbs and will,
    Where he sat listening to the sad sea swell,
    Amid the roses which no time could kill.
    Naught could restore lost courage to his eyes,
    The Knightly ardour that he used to feel,
    Or make his heart the seat of high emprise,
    Or nerve his hand to grasp the shining steel.
    Whether she kept him fast by her enchantment,
    Or drove him forth to roam death-pale and weeping,
    Naught could remind him what his life's fair grant meant,
    Now that his soul was in Hegertha's keeping.




    The Dreamer.


    This is the dream of the Dreamer
    With the grave thought-sunken eyes,
    Which he dreamed between sleeping and waking,
    Between the night and the making
    Of dawn ... and he dreamed in this wise:

    To the gate of the dawn came a chariot
    Which four black stallions were drawing,
    And a spirit charioteer,
    With the burning eyes of a seer,
    Held them impatiently pawing.

    He mounted the floor of the chariot,
    And the Spirit drew together
    His reins, his strong grip tight'ning,
    And his thong flashed out like a lightning,
    And the horses rushed up to aether.

    The Dreamer was caught into space
    With a pang as of ending or birth,
    And lo! clouds builded above him,
    And beneath him soundless and moving
    The sea of his own little earth.

    They clove the walls of the clouds,
    And snorted each coal black stallion
    Nursed by the Spirit, whose hair
    Streamed out like a banner, and bare
    In the night was the moon--a medallion

    And then an ice-sheathed corpse
    With ancient glaciers and snouted
    Craters of fires extinct,
    Chain on chain of them linked.
    And the Lord of the Chariot shouted

    And shook out his hissing lash
    Over the backs of the four
    Till they whirled up faster and faster,
    Till the sun became vaster and vaster,
    And its flames leapt out with a roar

    Of mountains, subsident, resurging,
    Innumerable, ceaseless of action,
    Years and years into space....
    And the Dreamer covered his face,
    As he rode, in his stupefaction.

    They passed with a dip and a swerve,
    As a swallow skims the downs,
    Far up into the height,
    And the stars looked down from the night
    Like the lights of distant towns.

    Swift is the lonely thought
    Of a sage, a mountain-dweller,
    But swifter far was their rush
    Thro' the awful cold and the hush
    Of the spaces interstellar.

    They heard the approaching thunder,
    And saw the glare of a comet
    Holding its destined way
    To an undiscovered day,
    And its tresses streamed out from it.

    They broke thro' other systems,
    By huger alien spheres,
    Each in its orbit travelling,
    The timeless skeins unravelling
    Of a law with no count of years

    And came at last to a planet,
    Girt in a gleaming ring
    Of cloud and vapour and mist,
    Which the light of four moons kissed
    To a wonderful milk-white thing.

    Then the Spirit reined in his stallions,
    And pointed in exultation
    And turned his orbed eyes,
    Which burned with a wild surmise
    And a dreadful penetration,

    On the Dreamer, who followed, and lo!
    The Heavens had changed their stations,
    And their voids were with unknown
    And greater galaxies sown
    And altered constellations.

    And, beyond, a scatter of crystals,
    And, beyond, bright motes in a beam,
    And, beyond, while the Spirit probed him
    To the soul in the flesh that robed him,
    An uncountable shimmering stream.

    He saw these worlds all marshalled,
    And their ways all governed for ever;
    And he felt the sight of his soul
    Shrivel up like a fire-licked scroll
    In his insupportable terror.

    Then the Spirit pointed again,
    And wheeled the might of his horses
    And shouted ... and down they fell,
    As a pebble drops in a well,
    Thro' the worlds and the roar of their courses.

    And the Dreamer looked, and behold!
    In a point to aeons withdrawn....
    A scarce visible speck of light,
    His own sun like a mite,
    And the blur of his own little dawn.


    II

    Now the Dreamer, who rode by night
    In the car of the Spirit thro' space,
    Came in the blue of June morning,
    In a mood betwixt pity and scorning,
    To the populous market-place.

    Afar in the infinite blue
    Hung the snow-capped mountain-ranges;
    But round him moved the press
    Of the city's business
    In kaleidoscopic changes.

    For the square was all life and all colour,
    All confusion and clamour,
    As dealers showed the paces
    Of colts, untamed in the traces,
    To the rap of the auctioneer's hammer.

    He saw there the dusty sheep
    Trotting blindly amidst the throng;
    The swine with quivering snouts,
    The boys who urged them with shouts,
    The hawkers of picture and song;

    The brown-skinned peasants trudging
    By their slow-paced bullock wains,
    With children asprawl the load,
    And wives who scolded and rode
    With an eye to their husbands' gains;

    The hooknosed Orient merchants,
    Who came in the caravans
    And bargained over the prices
    Of silks and carpets and spices,
    Pearls and feathers and fans;

    The clumsy sailors in ear-rings
    From the echoing harbour beach,
    With parrots and shells for their wares,
    The light of the sun in their stares,
    The sound of the wind in their speech.

    And the shrill-voiced changers of money
    Who sat with their clerks at the tables....
    And it seemed to him all no matter
    As he gazed ... like the evening chatter
    Of starlings under his gables.


    III

    And lo! hard by at a pillar
    Two learned Sophists disputed,
    Taking the turn of speech
    And disciples applauded each
    Or else each other confuted

    With babble and clenching of fist,
    And thrusting of face into face,
    And saying "Demus hath reason"
    Or "Lycas hath conquered. The season
    Of Demus hath passed, and his place

    "Is with us no longer." And mildly
    The grave-eyed Dreamer watched them
    Shouting and seething and ranting.
    But, when they perceived him, panting
    (For a sudden impulse snatched them)

    Ran up a crowd of both factions
    And cried, "Oh! Master, befriend us,
    For we all of us know thou art wisest,
    That thou speakest the truth and despisest
    No man and his need. Therefore lend us

    "Thy wisdom in this our dilemma."
    And the Dreamer answered, "I hear."
    So they told him with quibble and chatter....
    And it seemed to him all no matter
    Like the croaking of frogs in a mere.


    IV

    And behold! there ran thro' the market,
    Hard by where the Dreamer stood,
    A natural, void of desire
    Save for warmth of the sun or of fire
    Or for softness abed or food.

    Naught held he dearer in mind,
    Save the branched lightning veins;
    And in naught more strongly rejoiced
    Save the sound of the thunder deep-voiced
    Or the fertile flash of the rains

    Or the seas climbing into the harbour;
    And so thro' the market he ran
    Happy and careless and free
    (Him no man heeded for he
    Was a boy who would ne'er be a man)

    Munching the gift of a cake,
    A pilfered apple or fig,
    Or danced with his shadow awhile,
    Smiling a secret smile,
    Or twirled a hued whirligig.

    And the Dreamer called to him, "Come!"
    As he skipped in the sun with his Shadow.
    And the boy came doubtful and shy
    With a timid foot and eye,
    As a young horse comes in a meadow.

    And the Dreamer touched his cheek
    And murmured, "Be not afraid,"
    And the boy took heart and smiled,
    For the voice was tender and mild,
    And then half sadly it said,

    "Oh! ye who have called me the Master,
    The Teller of Truth, and the Wise,
    Oh! ye who have strayed in the dark
    Give ear to my saying and mark,
    For I give you a pearl of price,

    "A dark saying, and a hard saying
    To those who read it aright--
    This natural, whom ye see,
    Is wiser, Oh! blind ones, than ye,
    And thus have I learned in the night."




DIALOGUES.




    The Parting of Lancelot and Guinevere.

    (Mallory paraphrased.)


    "Be as be may," said Lancelot,
    "I go upon my quest."
    So mounted he and rode alone
    Eight days into the West.
    And to a nunnery came at last
    Hard by a forest ride,
    And walking in the cloister-shades
    Was by the Queen espied.
    And, when she saw him, swooned she thrice
    And said, when speak she might,
    "Ye marvel why I make this fare?
    'Tis truly for the sight
    Of yonder knight that standeth there,
    And so must ever be;
    Wherefore I pray you swiftly go
    And call him unto me."
    And to them all said Guinevere
    When Lancelot was brought
    "Fair ladies, thro' this man and me
    Hath all this war been wrought,
    And death of the most noblest knights
    Of whom we have record.
    And thro' the love we loved is slain
    My own most noble lord.
    Wherefor, Sir Lancelot, wit thou well,
    As thou dost wish my weal,
    That I am set in such a plight
    To get my dear soul heal.
    For sinners were the Saints in Heaven
    And trust I in God's grace
    To sit that day at Christ's right hand
    And see His Blessed Face.
    Therefore I heartily require
    And do beseech thee sore
    For all the love betwixt us was
    To see my face no more.
    But bid thee now, on God's behalf,
    That thou my side forsake,
    And to thy kingdom turn again,
    And keep thy realm from wrake.
    My heart, as well it loved thee once,
    Serveth me not arights
    To see thee, sithen is destroyed
    The flower of kings and knights.
    Therefore now get thee to thy realm
    And take to thee a wife
    And live with her in joy and bliss,
    And pray God mend my life."
    "Nay, Madam," said Sir Lancelot,
    "That shall I never do,
    For I should never be so false
    Of that I promised you.
    But unto the same destiny
    As you I will me take,
    And cast me specially to pray
    For you, for Jesu's sake.
    In you I take record of God,
    Mine earthly joy I found,
    And had you willed had taken you
    To dwell on mine own ground.
    But sithen you are thus disposed
    And will the world forsake,
    Be now ensured that I likewise
    To penance will me take,
    And so, if haply I may find
    A hermit white or grey
    Who shall receive and shrive me clean,
    While lasteth life will pray.
    Wherefore I pray you kiss me now,
    And never then no mo."
    "Nay," said the Queen, "Oh! get thee gone,
    That can I never do."
    So parted they with wondrous dole
    And swooned for their great teen
    And to her chamber scarce on live
    Her ladies bare the Queen.
    But Lancelot woke at last and went
    And took his horse from keeping,
    And all that day and all that night
    Rode thro' a forest weeping.




    The Hermit and the Faun.


    A hermit knelt before his door
    Long-bearded, bald of head,
    When a laughing faun peeped thro' the brake
    And these the words he said,
    "My mother was a water-nymph
    And in these woods I grew,
    The faun, Amyntas, is my name,
    To what name answer you?
    How came you to this lonely hut,
    Why kneel you in the dust,
    With scalp as bald as a beggar's bowl
    And beard as red as rust?
    Why make you with those knotted claws
    Your gestures strange and sad?
    The sheep-bells tinkle from the plain,
    The forest paths are glad."

    "Oh! creature of the wood and wild
    You may not know my name,
    It was forgotten long ago
    For it was one of shame.
    Therefore I made a vow to dwell
    Upon this forest brink
    And take the ripened nuts for food
    And catch the rain for drink,
    To scrape wild honey from the rocks
    And make my bed on leaves
    Because of the hot sins of my youth
    Whereat my spirit grieves."

    "Not such as you, Oh! ancient man,
    Our joyous Satyrs here:
    Old men are they all laughter-mad
    Who wallow in good cheer.
    Amid lush grasses soft and cool
    They make their feasting ground,
    With smilax and with bryony
    Their rosy pates are crowned.
    You see them thro' the forest trunks
    Great rolling gladsome shapes,
    Who prop themselves on skins of wine
    By purple piles of grapes.
    Their huge brown bellies quake with mirth,
    Their ancient eyes are bright,
    And there they sit and roar old tales
    Far, far into the night.
    Then tipsy with the heady juice
    Each falls into a heap,
    Till white-horned morning bids him wake
    With all the land from sleep."

    "Oft lying in this lonely hut
    On panting summer nights
    I watched the stars like silver lamps
    Hung from those purple heights,
    And heard the forest-depths behind
    Fill with disquieting noise
    Like frightened cries of flying girls
    And shouts of eager boys,
    And saw white shapes go flitting past
    Like runners in a race
    And caught faint murmurs, sighs and laughs
    From all the forest place.
    And oft a distant sound of shouts
    Came with the soft night airs,
    And I ... lest evil might befall
    Got swiftly to my prayers."

    "And tell me now, Oh! ancient man,
    The God to whom you pray,
    These woods know none but mighty Pan
    Whom all our folk obey.
    His altar stands by yonder plane
    And there the shepherds bring,
    Toiling up from the fields below,
    Each day an offering,
    A lamb or else a yearling kid,
    A bud-horned lusty fellow,
    Great cheeses, grapes, or bursting figs,
    Or apples red and yellow,
    Or melons ripened in the sun
    A foot from end to end.
    Such gifts the shepherds bring to Pan
    That he may be their friend.

    "He is our Father, Lord of all,
    From the meadow to the Pass,
    So ... pray you to a painted bird,
    Or green snake in the grass?"

    "Rash Thing, beware," the Hermit cried,
    Like agates were his eyes,
    "The God I serve you do not know
    A strong God, just and wise.
    For He will purge your streams and woods,
    And smite both hip and thigh
    Your Satyrs, amorous bestial sots,
    Your careless company
    Who wanton in the thymy ways
    In which these woods abound,
    And kiss with soft empurpled mouths,
    Luxuriantly crowned.
    My soul is filled with prophecy;
    Dimly I see a bark
    Which runs by some low wooded isle;
    The night is warm and dark,
    And from a promontory rings
    A sudden bitter cry,
    It smites the lonely helmsman's ears
    And tingles in the sky.
    'Oh! Traveller, tell in every land
    These tidings strange and dread,
    Let all the peoples wail and weep,
    For Pan, great Pan, is dead.'"

    Amyntas pursed his pouting lips
    And shook his curly head,
    "Farewell, old man, the forest calls;
    I like you not," he said.
    "Your flesh is dried, your ribs are lean,
    You are too lank and sere,
    Your voice is harsh, your words are grim
    And do not please mine ear.
    The great god Pan is all I need
    And all I wish to know,
    My Father Pan, the shepherd's god,
    And now, old man, I go."

    Behind him closed a greening brake,
    And, after many a hail,
    He joined his gay companions
    And gambolled in a vale.




    Love's Defiance.


    "Light of my life lie close
    Oh! Love, I have found you at last;
    Let me hear your low sweet voice
    The knell of the aching past.
    The lashes lie on your cheek
    Oh! lift them and show me your eyes;
    Twin stars in a mortal face,
    They are soft, they are kind, they are wise."

    "Heart of my hungry heart
    My hero whose hand is in mine
    If we fall let it be to the pit,
    For to-day we have touched the divine.
    Time has stood still to-day....
    This day which has squandered its sun.
    It has been all glory and gold
    All perfect days in this one."

    "Light of my life, my love,
    My lady of dreams, lie near,
    The evening sighs thro' the pines,
    Hark! do you feel no fear?
    The light of love flashes out....
    Oh! wonder so old and so new--
    I am strong with the strength of that name,
    Dear, when I look at you."

    "Heart of my beating heart,
    My friend whose forehead I kiss
    In the days which were not days,
    Weaker was I than this.
    In the years which the locust ate
    My spirit clove to the dust,
    But now--come fate--I am bold,
    I build on a higher trust."

    "Light of my life, my Queen,
    Let us quarrel no more with life--
    The tears--or the final truth--
    We are victors now in the strife.
    With its purer days of joy
    With its prison anguish too,
    All myself, and the past of myself,
    My darling, worship you."

    "Heart of my singing heart,
    My lover, my lord, all hail!
    Fear shall be underfoot,
    I feel that we shall not fail.
    In the shadowy land we leave
    The grim wolves raven and bark,
    But our hearts are steadfast at length
    And our faces turn from the dark."




    The Playmates.


    "Oh! Mary, Mary, my Mary, oh!
    You looked so bonny then.
    Will you no give me your little hand,
    The sweetest hand I ken?"

    "Oh! I will give you my little hand,
    I'm sweir to say you no,
    Oh! I'll now give you my hands both
    My friendship for to show."

    "Oh! Mary, Mary, my lassie dear,
    The tears stand in these eyne.
    Will you no give me a kind word
    For the sake of old lang syne?"

    "Oh! I will give you a kind word
    Tho' I have little skill,
    For the time that we were children
    And played upon the hill."

    "Oh! Mary, Mary, my lass o' gold,
    Will you no give me a kiss?
    My heart, I think, is like to break
    If you refuse me this."

    "Alas! and if I must refuse
    You will not think me bad.
    That your heart should break for my sake,
    In truth it makes me sad."

    "Oh! Mary, Mary, my lassie oh!
    I will be true as steel.
    Will you no give me your promised word
    For the love that I do feel?"

    "Indeed--indeed--I like you well
    Aye, better than my brother,
    But I canna give you my promised word
    For--I must wait for another."




DRAMAS.




    June and November.


    On a day, long ago, I was just a child,
    I walked with my lover, my arm in his arm,
    Half of me was sad and half with joy was wild,
    The wind was so soft and the sun was so warm.
    I walked with my lover to his pretty nonsense listening,
    And I pressed my beating heart against my lover's side;
    And tho' my voice was steady my traitor eyes were glistening,
    I showed to my lover all I wished to hide.
    His vows were so tender, his speech was so fluent,
    He whispered his sorrow if ever we must part.
    My heart in my bosom fluttered and played truant,
    So I gave it him all ... my innocent heart.
    On a green bank amidst the purple irises,
    And the shadow of a pine-wood across it was flung,
    I gave him soft words, I gave him my kisses,
    I gave him myself--myself that was so young.
    On a day, long ago, (pity to remember
    How the wind was soft, how the sun was warm,)--
    Then it was June and now it is November,
    Then I knew no evil nor thought of any harm.




    A Foolish Tragedy.


    In the capital of Valladolid
    There lived a highborn maiden
    In a white house in a steep street
    With green doors and shutters,
    Her lips were like scarlet poppies
    And her hair like a black waterfall,
    And behind her ear she wore
    A flower of red geranium.

    And her Spanish lover sighed
    And in his love he cried,
    "Heaven were nearer
    If she were dearer,
    She is the most wonderful and beautiful thing
    In the capital of Valladolid.

    "If I could persuade her father,
    That fierce and rich old Councillor,
    Not to despise my suit
    But let me speak to his daughter,
    I would esteem it more
    Than the rank of a Grandee of Spain,
    A cargo of spices from Java
    Or a galleon laden with silver."

    Under a brazen crucifix
    And the outstretched arms of our Saviour
    (And over her ivory shoulder
    Her black hair poured like a waterfall)
    To Mary, Mother of Heaven,
    Prayed the foolish maiden,
    "Mary, send me a lover,
    Young and tender and handsome."

    It chanced on a day of festival
    In the capital of Valladolid
    That their eyes met at a crossing
    And their two souls rushed together.
    By the greed of a bought duenna
    And the interchange of love-notes
    And the help of a hempen ladder
    They arranged a meeting at midnight.

    Her father, the rich old Councillor,
    Looked out of a second-floor window
    And passed his sword thro' the body
    Of one who climbed up a ladder.
    His fingers loosed the rungs
    And down he crashed to the pavement.
    And out of his handsome body
    His startled spirit departed.

    And the Spanish maiden cried
    And moaned until she died,
    "My lover dead,
    My honour sped."
    So ended a foolish tragedy
    In the capital of Valladolid.




    Alone!


    I

    Alone and built of a pallid stone
    Across the levels looked her house
    And tattered plot, where nought had grown
    But withered trees which creaked their boughs.
    No fruit or blossom or petal blown
    Was there to gladden mournful eyes,
    But all was drab and monotone
    Beneath a reign of leaden skies.
    A red, red weed was all the flower,
    Which crawled serpiginous about
    The marsh, unchanged from hour to hour
    Until the evening blotted out
    The landscape which she called her own.

    And, save for a ridge of bent and sand,
    Which rose between them and the sea,
    The marshes stretched on either hand,
    And, ever looking, wearied she
    Of low sad purple and sombre brown
    And, where the rivulets trickled down,
    Moss-tracks of vivid green,
    And stiff grey grasses which bend and sigh,
    As the marsh wind wails and passes by,
    And quagmires in between
    The firmer ground--and over all
    She heard the curlews' dreary call
    As they piped eternally.


    II

    In the days of grace, in the good days gone,
    She had set him up on a golden throne,
    The face of a god and a heart of stone,
    But now she must live alone,
    Alone, alone, alone
    In a little grey house of stone
    Which stares o'er the marshes towards the sea
    Where the great grey waves roll sullenly
    Night and day for ever and aye
    With mournful voices which seem to say
    "Alone, alone, alone."


    III

    She laid her down on a sandy ledge,
    Alone,
    And buried her face amid the sedge
    And mourned till eve for a broken pledge,
    Alone,
    And the great grey sea began to moan
    Gathering noise from depths unknown
    And boomed with a hollow undertone
    "Alone, alone, alone."


    IV

    Up came the night with funeral wing
    The ominous depths o'ershadowing,
    But she lay a dumb insentient thing--
    Alone with a heart of stone,
    With neither tears nor hopes nor fears
    And the booming swell like a monstrous knell
    Tolled strongly in her ears.


    V

    Alone, alone, alone,
    She who had loved and known
    On other nights like this
    Strong arms about her and many a kiss
    And words of gentle tone.

    Alone, alone, alone,
    A woman she had known
    Like a figure carved from stone
    Held a letter in her hand
    She scarce could understand
    Of words which hardly could be read
    "Goodbye--There is nothing to be said."

          *    *    *    *    *

    Ah! God, if she had known.

    Alone, alone, alone,
    She who had longed for love by stealth
    As a gold-mad miser longs for wealth
    Or a poet longs for fame,
    Her seared numb body had just an ache
    For a pitiful pitiless last mistake
    And the smirch upon her name.


    VI

    A shrill chill wind blew out of the West
    As a young child wails for a Mother's breast,
    It broke the swell and whitened each crest
    And moaned "I come with a strange behest;
    The dead are happier. They are at rest
    Alone, alone, alone,
    Each under a graven stone,
    Where the poppies are red
    In the homes of the dead
    And their scarlet petals spill
    And the seabirds scream
    As they wheel and gleam
    And the seawinds whistle shrill.
    The dead are happy, for they are free
    They have said farewell to misery,
    Alone
    Each under a stone;
    But the hearts which mourn for a faithless friend
    Can never, never, never mend,
    And so they break for friendship's sake
    Alone, alone, alone."


    VII

    The sea wind blew like a wild lament
    For loved ones dying or love mis-spent
    And still in her hollow of sand and bent
    She lay alone, alone,
    And stared out into the keening blast
    Not heeding the future or mourning the past,
    For past and future were one.


    VIII

    Ah! pity her, who needed it most--
    But in the village along the coast
    Are those who tremble and moan,
    Seeming to wait alone
    For a dreadful something unknown,
    As the tempest travels gathering force
    And sobs and howls and raves and roars
    And laughs like a demon band,
    And the great waves clamber into the bay
    With voices triumphant which seem to say
    "Hurrah! Hurrah! we have found a prey
    But we seek another on land."

    Ah! shivering fisherwife in your shawl,
    Perhaps they have found a prey
    Who leap and shout in the bay,
    And you will weep for the grief of it all
    For many and many a day.


    IX

    All night the moon peered wan and pale
    Thro' rifts in a scudding storm-rent veil
    O'er a moving mountainous waste.
    All night did the climbers rear and roar
    And fall with a crash upon the shore,
    League on league of them coming in haste
    Till they broke and leapt no more,
    Leaping and shouting until they broke
    Upon the screaming shore.
    And the simple hardy fisherfolk
    Kept watch and slept no more,
    As the wicked wind raved down the street
    With gouts of foam and slings of sleet
    And battered at every door.

    All night the tiles like chips of straw
    Were borne, and the air was filled with the roar
    Of the monstrous symphony.
    But its music lulled as the morning came
    And touched the East with a rosy flame,
    And whitened a hard clear sky,
    And the tide drew out far far to the sea
    Which shouted less tumultuously,
    Tho' its voices were heard for a sign,
    As it beat upon the barrier rocks
    With the baffled rage of the Equinox
    In a spouting misty line.


    X

    After a night so fierce and foul
    What wonder such a day?
    The wind, which shrieked like a tortured soul
    Last night across the bay,
    Blew high and keen like a violin
    And dashed the blue with spray.

    After a night so mad and wild
    An afternoon of blue,
    Of glinting, winking, glad blue waters
    And breakers only a few,
    Of light and azure undefiled
    With scarce a cloud in view.

    And at the hour of evening prayer
    Came three who roamed the shore,
    The sea was older, colder, and greyer,
    And moved and murmured more.

    Amid the waste of heaven and sea
    A body lay alone,
    Half in a pool and half on the knee
    Of an ancient mossy stone.

    The sea had saved a poor little fool
    From life and all its harms,
    Her body lay in a lonely pool--
    Not in a lover's arms.

    And on her cheek the mask of peace
    And on her lips the smile
    Of those who mourn and find release,
    Who know, not love, the vile.




    The Wraith.


    A pale wraith stood in the dim grey dawn
    Beside his old love's bed
    Wavering like a film of lawn
    And wrang his hands and said,
    "Oh! I have come to make my prayer
    For I cannot take my rest
    When I think of the red crown I called your hair
    And the cold stone in your breast.

    "Out of the eyeless hopeless dark
    The nights that are black and grey
    Never a moon or faint star-spark
    Or a lonely glimmer of day.
    Oh! my love, I have come, love,
    From the ebony gates of death
    For the sake of the red crown I called your hair
    And the jasmine of your breath."

    But his voice was lost like a mouse's scream
    In a lonely empty house,
    And the woman lay in a tender dream
    Of love and orchard boughs,
    Her cheeks were flushed and twice she sighed
    As she turned upon her bed
    And she had no thought for the thing that cried
    Or the utterance of the dead.




    The Two Murderers.


    "Yes, it was I that killed her
    I did it with this knife,
    Her that was more to me once....
    Well, just the whole of my life.
    Take me away and hide me,
    Or kill me afore I'm mad....
    It's rummy to think of me hanging
    Who was such a quiet lad.

    "I met her here on the tow-path,
    Same as I used in May,
    There wasn't no moon yet, only
    The scent of the new-mown hay,
    And I says--well--I thought for a moment
    The happy times was near,
    'The light that shineth in darkness
    Is the light of your eyes, my dear.'

    "Murder! a court full of lawyers....
    And justice guaranteed....
    And the judge will hang the prisoner
    'For a cowardly cruel deed.'...
    Murder!--excuse my laughing!...
    It's a kind of catch in the breath....
    'But there's words more harsh than a rope is
    And looks more bitter than death.'

    "Murder! My Lud, if ever
    Their ledgers are balanced true
    Which of the pair?... Oh! I reckon
    That she killed something too.
    ... Is it the scent of a woman's hair
    Or the scent of new-mown hay?...
    Don't stand there shaking and staring,
    For God's sake take me away."




REFLECTIONS.




    The Wind and the Hills.


    We will carry our ills
    To a height of the hills,
    Lying down, lying still
    In the lap of a hill.

    The wind blowing keen
    Shall again make us clean,
    Both body and spirit;
    As it passes we shall hear it.

    The time is of thunder
    And fields new turned under,
    Of budding and waking;
    Of thorn-blossom flaking.

    Of longing and questing;
    Of carol and nesting;
    Of white birds on the wing
    Over seas blue with spring.

    But you read in the pages
    Of the books of the sages,
    And save that dark curtain
    They know nothing certain,

    Except that dark portal
    Which waits all things mortal--
    And conqueror or prophet
    Comprehend no more of it.

    Yet the wind travels so
    That it surely must know;
    It has gone the world round
    Till it came to our ground.

    And the hills, which stood fast
    Ere the first axe was cast
    And have seen so much history,
    May have fathomed the mystery.

    But the hills on our borders
    Are silent old warders,
    And the winds which rejoice
    No articulate voice.

    Oh! ye pure larger airs
    Ye will scatter our cares--
    Mighty bastions of ours,
    Uplift that which cowers,

    For behind your grave brows
    Are a thousand strong "Nows--"
    And the wind has a "must"
    In its rude healthy gust.

    How it braces and rightens
    That wind to make Titans!
    Its strenuous wooing
    Says, "Up, lads, and doing."

    So leaving the high down
    Like giants we stride down;
    While the valleys before us
    Resound to our chorus.

    Having been each a seer
    To whom all things were near,
    Not resenting or grieving
    But simply believing.




    The Happy Ones.


    They awaited with head erect
    Whatever fate could befall them;
    Tried but the good to recollect,
    Cried for the truth to call them.
    To be loved by the children of other suns
    And send a message to find them,
    This is the fate of the happiest ones
    Tho' the mortar of life may grind them.
    They were like swimmers breasting the waves
    In the troughs of a stormy channel,
    They are silent now in their lonely graves,
    But the world has become the panel.
    They wore the truth like a bridal dress
    And sorrow like wedding apparel,
    Tho' the placid laughed at their foolishness
    And the cynic sneered from his barrel.
    Or like the wandering Ishmaelites,
    Who found no city to dwell in,
    Whose lonely hearts ached for pleasant sights,
    Whose graves were the places they fell in,
    Rock their pillow and sand their bed,
    As the sun of the desert paints them;
    The fierce kites screaming overhead,
    And the hands of all men against them.
    But a word goes out and over the earth,
    From the silent burying-places,
    Like a gentle rain in a land of dearth,
    And lights up the tired faces.
    It brings a roof and a sweet abode
    To many a soul that is vagrant;
    Their names are blossoms along the road
    And their lives are for ever fragrant.
    We who sorrow are brothers of theirs,
    Because of their beautiful sorrows,
    Wheat will grow up among the tares,
    And young corn grow in the furrows.




    A Question.


    Why do you prate to me
    Of deeds unjust and just,
    Moved by a story of good
    Or a monstrous tale of crimes--
    Me that can have no loves
    But star-eyed queens long dust,
    Me that can mourn no griefs
    But the tears in poets' rhymes?




    The Earth.


    The Earth and her travail are ancient,
    Her gods have but reigned for a while--
    The moon-crowned Queen Astarte,
    The barking god of the Nile.
    Her temples were raised and builded,
    And crumbled again to the dust--
    Her worships have been and vanished--
    But the heart of the Earth is just.




    Aspirations.


    For that Thou pointest further still
    Than that dumb hand upon the hour
    Nor givest the boon to sap the will,
    I thank Thee, wise and tender power.

    For that Thou givest my soul some pride,
    Not grudging sorrow for a mate,
    For this my wild and lovely bride
    I thank Thee, just, compassionate.

    For that Thou givest my soul some strength
    Of that high strength which rules the stars,
    To brave the time and wait the length,
    I bless Thy name and kiss my scars.




    Romance.


    Know the decree that natures such as mine
    Must clasp the World and find her half-divine,
    Hyperion-souls which need no anodyne.
    Once more, once more ye come, ye lovely shapes,
    Voicing the magic "Ye are Gods, not Apes."
    And oh! the Glory over seas and capes.
    In memory only!--What that memory gave
    Of our young day, so brief and yet so brave,
    Will lead us half reluctant to the grave.
    Tho' it existed not--lived never--only came
    From some vast depth of dateless woe and shame
    Striving to give its high desire a name,
    The glory dies not; leaves us tired and still;
    We cannot follow, even if we will;
    The Afterglow! Ah! there--beyond the hill.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

BEAUTIES OF TENNYSON.




THE BROOK.


    I come from haunts of coot and hern,
      I make sudden sally
    And sparkle out among the fern,
      To bicker down a valley.

    By thirty hills I hurry down,
      Or slip between the ridges,
    By twenty thorps, a little town,
      And half a hundred bridges.

         *       *       *

    I chatter over stony ways,
      In little sharps and trebles,
    I bubble into eddying bays,
      I babble on the pebbles.

    With many a curve my banks I fret
      By many a field and fallow,
    And many a fairy foreland set
      With willow-weed and mallow.

         *       *       *

    And here and there a foamy lake
      Upon me, as I travel
    With many a silvery waterbreak
      Above the golden gravel,

    And draw them all along, and flow
      To join the brimming river,
    For men may come and men may go,
      But I go on for ever.

[Illustration: "I CHATTER OVER STONY WAYS, IN LITTLE SHARPS AND
TREBLES."]




SONG FROM "MAUD."


    See what a lovely shell,
    Small and pure as a pearl,
    Lying close to my foot,
    Frail, but a work divine,
    Made so fairily well
    With delicate spire and whorl,
    How exquisitely minute,
    A miracle of design!

    What is it? a learned man
    Could give it a clumsy name.
    Let him name it who can,
    The beauty would be the same.

    The tiny cell is forlorn,
    Void of the little living will
    That made it stir on the shore.
    Did he stand at the diamond door
    Of his house in a rainbow frill?
    Did he push, when he was uncurl'd,
    A golden foot or a fairy horn
    Thro' his dim water-world.

    Slight, to be crushed with a tap
    Of my finger-nail on the sand,
    Small, but a work divine,
    Frail, but of force to withstand,
    Year upon year, the shock
    Of cataract seas that snap
    The three-decker's oaken spine
    Athwart the ledges of rock,
    Here on the Breton strand!

[Illustration: "SEE WHAT A LOVELY SHELL, LYING CLOSE TO MY FOOT."]




A FAREWELL.


    Flow down, cold rivulet, to the sea,
      Thy tribute wave deliver:
    No more by thee my steps shall be,
      For ever and for ever.

    Flow, softly flow, by lawn and lea,
      A rivulet then a river:
    Nowhere by thee my steps shall be,
      For ever and for ever.

    But here will sigh thine alder tree,
      And here thine aspen shiver;
    And here by thee will hum the bee,
      For ever and for ever.

    A thousand suns will stream on thee,
      A thousand moons will quiver;
    But not by thee my steps shall be,
      For ever and for ever.

[Illustration: "FLOW DOWN, COLD RIVULET, TO THE SEA."]




SONG FROM "MAUD."


    Come into the garden, Maud,
      For the black bat, night, has flown,
    Come into the garden, Maud,
      I am here at the gate alone;
    And the woodbine spices are wafted abroad,
      And the musk of the roses blown.

    For a breeze of morning moves,
      And the planet of Love is on high,
    Beginning to faint in the light that she loves
      On a bed of daffodil sky,
    To faint in the light of the sun she loves,
      To faint in his light, and to die.

         *       *       *

    There has fallen a splendid tear
      From the passion-flower at the gate.
    She is coming, my dove, my dear;
      She is coming, my life, my fate;
    The red rose cries, "She is near, she is near;"
      And the white rose weeps, "She is late;"
    The larkspur listens, "I hear, I hear;"
      And the lily whispers, "I wait."

    She is coming, my own, my sweet;
      Were it ever so airy a tread,
    My heart would hear her and beat,
      Were it earth in an earthy bed;
    My dust would hear her and beat,
      Had I lain for a century dead;
    Would start and tremble under her feet,
      And blossom in purple and red.

[Illustration: "THE RED ROSE CRIES, 'SHE IS NEAR, SHE IS NEAR.'"]




BREAK, BREAK, BREAK.


    Break, break, break,
      On thy cold gray stones, O Sea!
    And I would that my tongue could utter
      The thoughts that arise in me.

    O well for the fisherman's boy,
      That he shouts with his sister at play!
    O well for the sailor lad,
      That he sings in his boat on the bay!

    And the stately ships go on
      To their haven under the hill;
    But O for the touch of a vanish'd hand,
      And the sound of a voice that is still!

    Break, break, break,
      At the foot of thy crags, O Sea!
    But the tender grace of a day that is dead
      Will never come back to me.

[Illustration: "BREAK, BREAK, BREAK, AT THE FOOT OF THY CRAGS, O SEA!"]




FROM "LOCKSLEY HALL."


    Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in his glowing hands;
    Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands.

    Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might;
    Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of sight.

    Many a morning on the moorland did we hear the copses ring,
    And her whisper throng'd my pulses with the fulness of the Spring.

    Many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately ships,
    And our spirits rush'd together at the touching of the lips.

    O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my Amy, mine no more!
    O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren shore!

[Illustration: "MANY AN EVENING BY THE WATERS DID WE WATCH THE STATELY
SHIPS."]




SONG FROM "MAUD."


    Go not, happy day,
      From the shining fields,
    Go not, happy day,
      Till the maiden yields.
    Rosy is the West,
      Rosy is the South,
    Roses are her cheeks,
      And a rose her mouth
    When the happy Yes
      Falters from her lips,
    Pass and blush the news
      Over glowing ships;
    Over blowing seas,
      Over seas at rest,
    Pass the happy news,
      Blush it thro' the West;
    Till the red man dance
      By his red cedar-tree,
    And the red man's babe
      Leap, beyond the sea.
    Blush from West to East,
      Blush from East to West,
    Till the West is East,
      Blush it thro' the West.
    Rosy is the West,
      Rosy is the South,
    Roses are her cheeks,
      And a rose her mouth.

[Illustration: "GO NOT, HAPPY DAY, TILL THE MAIDEN YIELDS."]




SONG FROM "THE PRINCESS."


    Sweet and low, sweet and low,
      Wind of the western sea,
    Low, low, breathe and blow,
      Wind of the western sea!
    Over the rolling waters go,
    Come from the dying moon, and blow,
      Blow him again to me;
    While my little one, while my pretty one, sleeps.

    Sleep and rest, sleep and rest,
      Father will come to thee soon;
    Rest, rest, on mother's breast,
      Father will come to thee soon;
    Father will come to his babe in the nest,
    Silver sails all out of the west
      Under the silver moon:
    Sleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep.

[Illustration: "FATHER WILL COME TO HIS BABE IN THE NEST."]




LILIAN.


        Airy, fairy Lilian,
        Flitting, fairy Lilian,
    When I ask her if she love me,
    Claps her tiny hands above me,
        Laughing all she can;
    She'll not tell me if she love me,
        Cruel little Lilian.

        When my passion seeks
        Pleasance in love-sighs,
    She, looking thro' and thro' me
    Thoroughly to undo me,
        Smiling, never speaks:
    So innocent-arch, so cunning-simple,
    From beneath her gather'd wimple
      Glancing with black-beaded eyes,
    Till the lightning laughters dimple
        The baby-roses in her cheeks;
        Then away she flies.

      Prythee weep, May Lilian!
        Gayety without eclipse
      Wearieth me, May Lilian:
    Thro' my very heart it thrilleth
      When from crimson-threaded lips
    Silver-treble laughter trilleth:
      Prythee weep, May Lilian.

        Praying all I can,
    If prayers will not hush thee,
        Airy Lilian,
    Like a rose-leaf I will crush thee,
        Fairy Lilian.

[Illustration: AIRY, FAIRY LILIAN.]




RING OUT, WILD BELLS.


    Ring out, wild bells, to the wild sky,
        The flying cloud, the frosty light:
        The year is dying in the night;
    Ring out, wild bells, and let him die.

    Ring out the old, ring in the new,
        Ring, happy bells, across the snow:
        The year is going, let him go;
    Ring out the false, ring in the true.

    Ring out the grief that saps the mind,
        For those that here we see no more;
        Ring out the feud of rich and poor,
    Ring in redress to all mankind.

    Ring out a slowly dying cause,
        And ancient forms of party strife;
        Ring in the nobler modes of life,
    With sweeter manners, purer laws.

    Ring out the want, the care, the sin,
        The faithless coldness of the times;
        Ring out, ring out my mournful rhymes,
    But ring the fuller minstrel in.

    Ring out false pride in place and blood,
        The civic slander and the spite;
        Ring in the love of truth and right,
    Ring in the common love of good.

    Ring out old shapes of foul disease;
        Ring out the narrowing lust of gold;
        Ring out the thousand wars of old,
    Ring in the thousand years of peace.

    Ring in the valiant man and free,
        The larger heart, the kindlier hand;
        Ring out the darkness of the land,
    Ring in the Christ that is to be.

[Illustration: "RING OUT, WILD BELLS, TO THE WILD SKY."]




FROM "THE PRINCESS."


    Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,
    Tears from the depth of some divine despair
    Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,
    In looking on the happy Autumn-fields,
    And thinking of the days that are no more.

    Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,
    That brings our friends up from the underworld,
    Sad as the last which reddens over one
    That sinks with all we love below the verge;
    So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.

    Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns
    The earliest pipe of half-awaken'd birds
    To dying ears, when unto dying eyes
    The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;
    So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.

    Dear as remember'd kisses after death,
    And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feign'd
    On lips that are for others; deep as love,
    Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;
    O Death in Life, the days that are no more.

[Illustration: "TEARS, IDLE TEARS."]




SONG FROM "THE PRINCESS."


        The splendor falls on castle-walls
            And snowy summits old in story:
        The long light shakes across the lakes,
          And the wild cataract leaps in glory.
    Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,
    Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.

        O hark, O hear! how thin and clear,
          And thinner, clearer, farther going!
        O sweet and far from cliff and scar
          The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!
    Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying:
    Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.

        O love, they die in yon rich sky,
          They faint on hill or field or river;
        Our echoes roll from soul to soul,
          And grow for ever and for ever.
    Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,
    And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.

[Illustration: "BLOW, BUGLE, BLOW, SET THE WILD ECHOES FLYING, BLOW,

FROM "ENOCH ARDEN."


    The mountain wooded to the peak, the lawns
    And winding glades high up like ways to Heaven,
    The slender coco's drooping crown of plumes
    The lightning flash of insect and of bird,
    The lustre of the long convolvuluses
    That coil'd around the stately stems, and ran
    Ev'n to the limit of the land, the glows
    And glories of the broad belt of the world,
    All these he saw; but what he fain had seen
    He could not see, the kindly human face,
    Nor ever hear a kindly voice, but heard
    The myriad shriek of wheeling ocean-fowl,
    The league-long roller thundering on the reef,
    The moving whisper of huge trees that branch'd
    And blossom'd in the zenith, or the sweep
    Of some precipitous rivulet to the wave,
    As down the shore he ranged, or all day long
    Sat often in the seaward-gazing gorge,
    A shipwreck'd sailor, waiting for a sail:
    No sail from day to day, but every day
    The sunrise broken into scarlet shafts
    Among the palms and ferns and precipices;
    The blaze upon the waters to the east;
    The blaze upon his island overhead;
    The blaze upon the waters to the west;
    Then the great stars that globed themselves in heaven,
    The hollower-bellowing ocean, and again
    The scarlet shafts of sunrise--but no sail.

[Illustration: "A SHIPWRECK'D SAILOR, WAITING FOR A SAIL."]




FROM "ENOCH ARDEN."


    But Enoch yearn'd to see her face again;
    'If I might look on her sweet face again
    And know that she is happy.' So the thought
    Haunted and harass'd him, and drove him forth
    At evening when the dull November day
    Was growing duller twilight, to the hill.
    There he sat down gazing on all below;
    There did a thousand memories roll upon him,
    Unspeakable for sadness. By and by
    The ruddy square of comfortable light,
    Far blazing from the rear of Philip's house,
    Allured him, as the beacon-blaze allures
    The bird of passage, till he madly strikes
    Against it, and beats out his weary life.

    For Philip's dwelling fronted on the street,
    The latest house to landward; but behind
    With one small gate that open'd on the waste,
    Flourish'd a little garden square and wall'd:
    And in it throve an ancient evergreen,
    A yew tree, and all round it ran a walk
    Of shingle, and a walk divided it:
    But Enoch shunn'd the middle walk and stole
    Up by the wall, behind the yew; and thence
    That which he better might have shunn'd, if griefs
    Like his have worse or better, Enoch saw.

[Illustration: "STOLE UP BY THE WALL, BEHIND THE YEW."]




THE CHARGE OF THE LIGHT BRIGADE.


    I.

    Half a league, half a league,
    Half a league onward,
    All in the valley of Death
      Rode the six hundred.
    'Forward, the Light Brigade!'
    'Charge for the guns!' he said:
    Into the valley of Death
      Rode the six hundred.


    II.

    'Forward, the Light Brigade!'
    Was there a man dismay'd?
    Not tho' the soldier knew
      Some one had blunder'd:
    Their's not to make reply,
    Their's not to reason why,
    Their's but to do and die:
    Into the valley of Death
      Rode the six hundred.


    III.

    Cannon to right of them,
    Cannon to left of them,
    Cannon in front of them
      Volley'd and thunder'd;
    Storm'd at with shot and shell,
    Boldly they rode and well,
    Into the jaws of Death,
    Into the mouth of Hell
      Rode the six hundred.


    IV.

    Flash'd all their sabres bare,
    Flash'd as they turn'd in air,
    Sabring the gunners there,
    Charging an army, while
      All the world wonder'd:
    Plunged in the battery-smoke
    Right thro' the line they broke;
    Cossack and Russian
    Reel'd from the sabre-stroke
      Shatter'd and sunder'd.
    Then they rode back, but not
    Not the six hundred.


    V.

    Cannon to right of them,
    Cannon to left of them,
    Cannon behind them
      Volley'd and thunder'd;
    Storm'd at with shot and shell,
    While horse and hero fell,
    They that had fought so well
    Came thro' the jaws of Death,
    Back from the mouth of Hell,
    All that was left of them,
      Left of six hundred.


    VI.

    When can their glory fade?
    O the wild charge they made!
      All the world wondered.
    Honor the charge they made!
    Honor the Light Brigade,
      Noble six hundred!

[Illustration: "BOLDLY THEY RODE AND WELL."]




FROM "THE MAY QUEEN."


    You must wake and call me early, call me early, mother dear;
    To-morrow 'ill be the happiest time of all the glad New-year;
    Of all the glad New-year, mother, the maddest merriest day;
    For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.

    There's many a black black eye, they say, but none so bright as mine;
    There's Margaret and Mary, there's Kate and Caroline:
    But none so fair as little Alice in all the land they say,
    So I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.

[Illustration: THE MAY QUEEN.]




SONG FROM "THE PRINCESS."


    As thro' the land at eve we went,
      And pluck'd the ripen'd ears,
    We fell out, my wife and I,
    O we fell out I know not why,
      And kiss'd again with tears,
    And blessings on the falling out
      That all the more endears,
    When we fall out with those we love
      And kiss again with tears!
    For when we came where lies the child
      We lost in other years,
    There above the little grave,
    O there above the little grave,
      We kiss'd again with tears.

[Illustration: "O THERE ABOVE THE LITTLE GRAVE, WE KISS'D AGAIN WITH
TEARS."]




FROM "HAROLD."


    _Tostig._ What for Norway then?
    He looks for land among us, he and his.

    _Harold._ Seven feet of English land, or something more,
    Seeing he is a giant.

    _Tostig._ That is noble!
    That sounds of Godwin.

    _Harold._ Come thou back, and be
    Once more a son of Godwin.

    _Tostig_ (_turns away_). O brother, brother,
    O Harold--

    _Harold_ (_laying his hand on Tostig's shoulder_). Nay then, come
    thou back to us!

    _Tostig_ (_after a pause turning to him_). Never shall any man
    say that I, that Tostig
    Conjured the mightier Harold from the North
    To do the battle for me here in England,
    Then left him for the meaner! thee!--
    Thou hast no passion for the House of Godwin--
    Thou hast but cared to make thyself a king--
    Thou hast sold me for a cry--
    Thou gavest thy voice against me in the Council--
    I hate thee, and despise thee, and defy thee.
    Farewell for ever!                              [_Exit._

    _Harold._ On to Stamford-bridge!

[Illustration: "NAY THEN, COME THOU BACK TO US!"]




FROM "THE REVENGE."


    And the sun went down, and the stars came out far over the summer sea,
    But never a moment ceased the fight of the one and the fifty-three.
    Ship after ship, the whole night long, their high-built galleons came,
    Ship after ship, the whole night long, with her battle-thunder and
      flame;
    Ship after ship, the whole night long, drew back with her dead and her
      shame.
    For some were sunk and many were shatter'd, and so could fight us no
      more--
    God of battles, was ever a battle like this in the world before?

    And the night went down, and the sun smiled out far over the summer
      sea,
    And the Spanish fleet with broken sides lay round us all in a ring;
    But they dared not touch us again, for they fear'd that we still could
      sting,
    So they watch'd what the end would be.
    And we had not fought them in vain,
    But in perilous plight were we,
    Seeing forty of our poor hundred were slain,
    And half of the rest of us maim'd for life
    In the crash of the cannonades and the desperate strife;
    And the sick men down in the hold were most of them stark and cold,
    And the pikes were all broken or bent, and the powder was all of it
      spent;
    And the masts and the rigging were lying over the side.

[Illustration: "SHIP AFTER SHIP, THE WHOLE NIGHT LONG, WITH HER
BATTLE-THUNDER AND FLAME."]

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

ALFRED LORD TENNYSON



EDITED WITH A CRITICAL INTRODUCTION. COMMENTARIES AND NOTES,

TOGETHER WITH THE VARIOUS READINGS,

A TRANSCRIPT OF THE POEMS TEMPORARILY AND FINALLY SUPPRESSED

AND A BIBLIOGRAPHY



BY

JOHN CHURTON COLLINS




PREFACE

A Critical edition of Tennyson's poems has long been an acknowledged
want. He has taken his place among the English Classics, and as a
Classic he is, and will be, studied, seriously and minutely, by many
thousands of his countrymen, both in the present generation as well as
in future ages. As in the works of his more illustrious brethren, so in
his trifles will become subjects of curious interest, and assume an
importance of which we have no conception now. Here he will engage the
attention of the antiquary, there of the social historian. Long after
his politics, his ethics, his theology have ceased to be immediately
influential, they will be of immense historical significance. A
consummate artist and a consummate master of our language, the process
by which he achieved results so memorable can never fail to be of
interest, and of absorbing interest, to critical students.

I must, I fear, claim the indulgence due to one who attempts, for the
first time, a critical edition of a text so perplexingly voluminous in
variants as Tennyson's. I can only say that I have spared neither time
nor labour to be accurate and exhaustive. I have myself collated, or
have had collated for me, every edition recorded in the British Museum
Catalogue, and where that has been deficient I have had recourse to
other public libraries, and to the libraries of private friends. I am
not conscious that I have left any variant unrecorded, but I should not
like to assert that this is the case. Tennyson was so restlessly
indefatigable in his corrections that there may lurk, in editions of the
poems which I have not seen, other variants; and it is also possible
that, in spite of my vigilance, some may have escaped me even in the
editions which have been collated, and some may have been made at a date
earlier than the date recorded. But I trust this has not been the case.

Of the Bibliography I can say no more than that I have done my utmost to
make it complete, and that it is very much fuller than any which has
hitherto appeared. That it is exhaustive I dare not promise.

With regard to the Notes and Commentaries, I have spared no pains to
explain everything which seemed to need explanation. There are, I think,
only two points which I have not been able to clear up, namely, the name
of the friend to whom the 'Palace of Art' was addressed, and the name
of the friend to whom the 'Verses after Reading a Life and Letters'
were addressed. I have consulted every one who would be likely to throw
light on the subject, including the poet's surviving sister, many of his
friends, and the present Lord Tennyson, but without success; so the
names, if they were not those of some imaginary person, appear to be
irrecoverable. The Prize Poem, 'Timbuctoo', as well as the poems which
were temporarily or finally suppressed in the volumes published in 1830
and 1832 have been printed in the Appendix: those which were
subsequently incorporated in his Works, in large type; those which he
never reprinted, in small.

The text here adopted is that of 1857, but Messrs. Macmillan, to whom I
beg to express my hearty thanks, have most generously allowed me to
record all the variants which are still protected by copyright. I have
to thank them, too, for assistance in the Bibliography. I have also to
thank Mr. J. T. Wise for his kindness in lending me the privately
printed volume containing the 'Morte d'Arthur, Dora,' etc.





INTRODUCTION

I

The development of Tennyson's genius, methods, aims and capacity of
achievement in poetry can be studied with singular precision and fulness
in the history of the poems included in the present volume. In 1842 he
published the two volumes which gave him, by almost general consent, the
first place among the poets of his time, for, though Wordsworth was
alive, Wordsworth's best work had long been done. These two volumes
contained poems which had appeared before, some in 1830 and some in
1832, and some which were then given to the world for the first time, so
that they represent work belonging to three eras in the poet's life,
poems written before he had completed his twenty-second year and
belonging for the most part to his boyhood, poems written in his early
manhood, and poems written between his thirty-first and thirty-fourth
year.

The poems published in 1830 had the following title-page:

  "Poems, Chiefly Lyrical, by Alfred Tennyson.
  London: Effingham Wilson, Royal Exchange, 1830".

They are fifty-six in number and the titles are:--

were not much altered.

included among the 'Juvenilia' in the collected works (1871-1872),
though excluded from all preceding editions of the poems.

+@  Those marked @+ were restored in editions previous to the first
collected editions of the works.




In December, 1832, appeared a second volume (it is dated on the
title-page, 1833):

"Poems by Alfred Tennyson. London: Moxon, MDCCCXXXIII."

This contains thirty poems:--


  Sonnet. (Mine be the strength of spirit fierce and free.) #

?   Of these the poems marked ? were included in the edition of 1842;

+   those marked + being greatly altered and in some cases almost
      rewritten,

@   those marked @ being practically unaltered.

#  To those reprinted in the collected works # is added.






In 1842 appeared the two volumes which contained, in addition to the
selections made from the two former volumes, several new poems:--

"Poems by Alfred Tennyson. In two volumes. London: Edward Moxon,
MDCCCXLII."

The first volume is divided into two parts:

(1) Selections from the poems published in 1830, 'Claribel' to the
'Sonnet to J. M. K.' inclusive.

(2) Selections from the poems of 1832, 'The Lady of Shalott' to 'The
Goose' inclusive.

The second volume contains poems then, with two exceptions, first
published.

Only two of these poems had been published before, namely, 'St. Agnes',
which was printed in 'The Keepsake' for 1837, and 'The Sleeping Beauty'
in 'The Day Dream', which was adopted with some alterations from the
1830 poem, and only one of these poems was afterwards suppressed, 'The
Skipping Rope', which was, however, allowed to stand till 1851. In 1843
appeared the second edition of these poems, which is merely a reprint
with a few unimportant alterations, and which was followed in 1845 and
in 1846 by a third and fourth edition equally unimportant in their
variants, but in the fourth 'The Golden Year' was added. In the next
edition, the fifth, 1848, 'The Deserted House' was included from the
poems of 1830. In the sixth edition, 1850, was included another poem,
'To--, after reading a Life and Letters', reprinted, with some
alterations, from the 'Examiner' of 24th March, 1849.

The seventh edition, 1851, contained important additions. First the
Dedication to the Queen, then 'Edwin Morris,' the fragment of 'The
Eagle,' and the stanzas, "Come not when I am dead," first printed in
'The Keepsake' for 1851, under the title of 'Stanzas.' In this edition
the absurd trifle 'The Skipping Rope' was excised and finally cancelled.
In the eighth edition, 1853, 'The Sea-Fairies,' though greatly altered,
was included from the poems of 1830, and the poem 'To E. L. on his
Travels in Greece' was added. This edition, the eighth, may be regarded
as the final one. Nothing afterwards of much importance was added or
subtracted, and comparatively few alterations were made in the text from
that date to the last collected edition in 1898.

All the editions up to, and including, that of 1898 have been carefully
collated, so that the student of Tennyson can follow step by step the
process by which he arrived at that perfection of expression which is
perhaps his most striking characteristic as a poet. And it was indeed a
trophy of labour, of the application "of patient touches of unwearied
art". Whoever will turn, say to 'The Palace of Art,' to '?none,' to the
'Dream of Fair Women,' or even to 'The Sea-Fairies' and to 'The Lady of
Shalott,' will see what labour was expended on their composition.
Nothing indeed can be more interesting than to note the touches, the
substitution of which measured the whole distance between mediocrity and
excellence. Take, for example, the magical alteration in the couplet in
the 'Dream of Fair Women':--


  One drew a sharp knife thro' my tender throat
  Slowly,--and nothing more,


into


  The bright death quiver'd at the victim's throat;
  Touch'd; and I knew no more.


Or, in the same poem:--


  What nights we had in Egypt!
  I could hit His humours while I cross'd him.
  O the life I led him, and the dalliance and the wit,


into

  We drank the Libyan Sun to sleep, and lit
  Lamps which outburn'd Canopus.
  O my life In Egypt!
  O the dalliance and the wit,
  The flattery and the strife.


Or, in 'Mariana in the South':--

  She mov'd her lips, she pray'd alone,
  She praying, disarray'd and warm
  From slumber, deep her wavy form
  In the dark lustrous mirror shone,

into

  Complaining, "Mother, give me grace
  To help me of my weary load".
  And on the liquid mirror glow'd
  The clear perfection of her face.


How happy is this slight alteration in the verses 'To J. S.' which
corrects one of the falsest notes ever struck by a poet:--

 A tear Dropt on _my tablets_ as I wrote.

  A tear Dropt on _the letters_ as I wrote.

or where in 'Locksley Hall' a splendidly graphic touch of description is
gained by the alteration of "_droops_ the trailer from the crag" into
"_swings_ the trailer".

So again in 'Love and Duty':--

  Should my shadow cross thy thoughts
  Too sadly for their peace, _so put it back_.
  For calmer hours in memory's darkest hold,

where by altering "so put it back" into "remand it thou," a somewhat
ludicrous image is at all events softened.

What great care Tennyson took with his phraseology is curiously
illustrated in 'The May Queen'. In the 1842 edition "Robin" was the name
of the May Queen's lover. In 1843 it was altered to "Robert," and in
1845 and subsequent editions back to "Robin".

Compare, again, the old stanza in 'The Miller's Daughter':--

  How dear to me in youth, my love,
  Was everything about the mill;
  The black and silent pool above,
  The pool beneath it never still,


with what was afterwards substituted:--


  I loved the brimming wave that swam
  Through quiet meadows round the mill,
  The sleepy pool above the dam,
  The pool beneath it never still.


Another most felicitous emendation is to be found in 'The Poet',
where the edition of 1830 reads:--


  And in the bordure of her robe was writ
  Wisdom, a name to shake
  Hoar anarchies, as with a thunderfit.


This in 1842 appears as:--


  And in her raiment's hem was trac'd in flame
  Wisdom, a name to shake
  All evil dreams of power--a sacred name.


Again, in the 'Lotos Eaters'


  _Three thunder-cloven thrones of oldest snow_
  Stood sunset-flushed


is changed into

  _Three silent pinnacles of aged snow_.


So in 'Will Waterproof' the cumbrous


  Like Hezekiah's backward runs The shadow of my days,


was afterwards simplified into


  Against its fountain upward runs
  The current of my days.


Not less felicitous have been the additions made from time to time. Thus
in 'Audley Court' the concluding lines ran:--


  The harbour buoy,
  With one green sparkle ever and anon
  Dipt by itself.


But what vividness is there in the subsequent insertion of


  "Sole star of phosphorescence in the calm."


between the first line and the second.

So again in the 'Morte d'Arthur' how greatly are imagery and rhythm
improved by the insertion of


  Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,


between


  Then went Sir Bedivere the second time,


and


  Counting the dewy pebbles, fix'd in thought.


There is an alteration in ?none which is very interesting. Till 1884
this was allowed to stand:--


  The lizard, with his shadow on the stone,
  Rests like a shadow, _and the cicala sleeps_.


No one could have known better than Tennyson that the cicala is loudest
in the torrid calm of the noonday, as Theocritus, Virgil, Byron and
innumerable other poets have noticed; at last he altered it, but at the
heavy price of a cumbrous pleonasm, into "and the winds are dead".

He allowed many years to elapse before he corrected another error in
natural history--but at last the alteration came. In 'The Poet's Song'
in the line--


  The swallow stopt as he hunted the _bee_,


the "fly" which the swallow does hunt was substituted for what it does
not hunt, and that for very obvious reasons. But whoever would see what
Tennyson's poetry has owed to elaborate revision and scrupulous care
would do well to compare the first edition of 'Mariana in the South',
'The Sea-Fairies', 'OEnone', 'The Lady of Shalott', 'The Palace of Art'
and 'A Dream of Fair Women' with the poems as they are presented in
1853. Poets do not always improve their verses by revision, as all
students of Wordsworth's text could abundantly illustrate; but it may be
doubted whether, in these poems at least, Tennyson ever made a single
alteration which was not for the better. Fitzgerald, indeed, contended
that in some cases, particularly in 'The Miller's Daughter', Tennyson
would have done well to let the first reading stand, but few critics
would agree with him in the instances he gives. We may perhaps regret
the sacrifice of such a stanza as this--

Each coltsfoot down the grassy bent, Whose round leaves hold the
gathered shower, Each quaintly folded cuckoo pint, And silver-paly
cuckoo flower.




II

Tennyson's genius was slow in maturing. The poems contributed by him to
the volume of 1827, 'Poems by Two Brothers', are not without some slight
promise, but are very far from indicating extraordinary powers. A great
advance is discernible in 'Timbuctoo', but that Matthew Arnold should
have discovered in it the germ of Tennyson's future powers is probably
to be attributed to the youth of the critic. Tennyson was in his
twenty-second year when the 'Poems Chiefly Lyrical' appeared, and what
strikes us in these poems is certainly not what Arthur Hallam saw in
them: much rather what Coleridge and Wilson discerned in them. They are
the poems of a fragile and somewhat morbid young man in whose temper we
seem to see a touch of Hamlet, a touch of Romeo and, more healthily, a
touch of Mercutio. Their most promising characteristic is the
versatility displayed. Thus we find 'Mariana' side by side with the
'Supposed Confessions', the 'Ode to Memory' with Greek['oi rheontes'],
'The Ballad of Oriana' with 'The Dying Swan', 'Recollections of The
Arabian Nights' with 'The Poet'. Their worst fault is affectation.
Perhaps the utmost that can be said for them is that they display a fine
but somewhat thin vein of original genius, after deducing what they owe
to Coleridge, to Keats and to other poets. This is seen in the magical
touches of description, in the exquisite felicity of expression and
rhythm which frequently mark them, in the pathos and power of such a
poem as 'Oriana', in the pathos and charm of such poems as 'Mariana' and
'A Dirge', in the rich and almost gorgeous fancy displayed in 'The
Recollections'.

The poems of 1833 are much more ambitious and strike deeper notes. Here
comes in for the first time that Greek[spondai_otaes'], that high
seriousness which is one of Tennyson's chief characteristics--we see it
in 'The Palace of Art', in '?none' and in the verses 'To J. S.' But in
intrinsic merit the poems were no advance on their predecessors, for the
execution was not equal to the design. The best, such as '?none', 'A
Dream of Fair Women', 'The Palace of Art', 'The Lady of Shalott'--I am
speaking of course of these poems in their first form--were full of
extraordinary blemishes. The volume was degraded by pieces which were
very unworthy of him, such as 'O Darling Room' and the verses 'To
Christopher North', and affectations of the worst kind deformed many,
nay, perhaps the majority of the poems. But the capital defect lay in
the workmanship. The diction is often languid and slipshod, sometimes
quaintly affected, and we can never go far without encountering lines,
stanzas, whole poems which cry aloud for the file. The power and charm
of Tennyson's poetry, even at its ripest, depend very largely, often
mainly, on expression, and the couplet which he envied Browning,

  The little more, and how much it is,
  The little less, and what worlds away,

is strangely applicable to his own art. On a single word, on a subtle
collocation, on a slight touch depend often his finest effects: "the
little less" reduces him to mediocrity, "the little more" and he is with
the masters. To no poetry would the application of Goethe's test be, as
a rule, more fatal--that the real poetic quality in poetry is that which
remains when it has been translated literally into prose.

Whoever will compare the poems of 1832 with the same poems as they
appeared in 1842 will see that the difference is not so much a
difference in degree, but almost a difference in kind. In the collection
of 1832 there were three gems, 'The Sisters', the lines 'To J. S.' and
'The May Queen'. Almost all the others which are of any value were, in
the edition of 1842, carefully revised, and in some cases practically
rewritten. If Tennyson's career had closed in 1833 he would hardly have
won a prominent place among the minor poets of the present century. The
nine years which intervened between the publication of his second volume
and the volumes of 1842 were the making of him, and transformed a mere
dilettante into a master. Much has been said about the brutality of
Lockhart's review in the 'Quarterly'. In some respects it was stupid, in
some respects it was unjust, but of one thing there can be no doubt--it
had a most salutary effect. It held up the mirror to weaknesses and
deficiencies which, if Tennyson did not care to acknowledge to others,
he must certainly have acknowledged to himself. It roused him and put
him on his mettle. It was a wholesome antidote to the enervating
flattery of coteries and "apostles" who were certainly talking a great
deal of nonsense about him, as Arthur Hallam's essay in the 'Englishman'
shows. During the next nine years he published nothing, with the
exception of two unimportant contributions to certain minor
periodicals.[1] But he was educating himself, saturating himself with
all that is best in the poetry of Ancient Greece and Rome, of modern
Italy, of Germany and of his own country, studying theology,
metaphysics, natural history, geology, astronomy and travels, observing
nature with the eye of a poet, a painter and a naturalist. Nor was he a
recluse. He threw himself heartily into the life of his time, following
with the keenest interest all the great political and social movements,
the progress and effects of the Reform Bill, the troubles in Ireland,
the troubles with the Colonies, the struggles between the Protectionists
and the Free Traders, Municipal Reform, the advance of the democracy,
Chartism, the popular education question. He travelled on the Continent,
he travelled in Wales and Scotland, he visited most parts of England,
not as an idle tourist, but as a student with note-book in hand. And he
had been submitted also to the discipline which is of all disciplines
the most necessary to the poet, and without which, as Goethe says, "he
knows not the heavenly powers": he had "ate his bread in sorrow". The
death of his father in 1831 had already brought him face to face, as he
has himself expressed it, with the most solemn of all mysteries. In 1833
he had an awful shock in the sudden death of his friend Arthur Hallam,
"an overwhelming sorrow which blotted out all joy from his life and made
him long for death". He had other minor troubles which contributed
greatly to depress him,--the breaking up of the old home at Somersby,
his own poverty and uncertain prospects, his being compelled in
consequence to break off all intercourse with Miss Emily Selwood. It is
possible that 'Love and Duty' may have reference to this sorrow; it is
certain that 'The Two Voices' is autobiographical.

Such was his education between 1832 and 1842, and such the influences
which were moulding him, while he was slowly evolving 'In Memoriam' and
the poems first published in the latter year. To the revision of the old
poems he brought tastes and instincts cultivated by the critical study
of all that was best in the poetry of the world, and more particularly
by a familiarity singularly intimate and affectionate with the
masterpieces of the ancient classics; he brought also the skill of a
practised workman, for his diligence in production was literally that of
Sir Joshua Reynolds in the sister art--'nulla dies sine linea'. Into the
composition of the new poems all this entered. He was no longer a
trifler and a Hedonist. As Spedding has said, his former poems betrayed
"an over-indulgence in the luxuries of the senses, a profusion of
splendours, harmonies, perfumes, gorgeous apparel, luscious meals and
drinks, and creature comforts which rather pall upon the sense, and make
the glories of the outward world to obscure a little the world within".
Like his own 'Lady of Shalott', he had communed too much with shadows.
But the serious poet now speaks. He appeals less to the ear and the eye,
and more to the heart. The sensuous is subordinated to the spiritual and
the moral. He deals immediately with the dearest concerns of man and of
society. He has ceased to trifle. The the [Greek: spondai_otaes,] the
high seriousness of the true poet, occasional before, now pervades and
enters essentially into his work. It is interesting to note how many of
these poems have direct didactic purpose. How solemn is the message
delivered in such poems as 'The Palace of Art' and 'The Vision of Sin',
how noble the teaching in 'Love and Duty', in 'Oenone', in 'Godiva', in
'Ulysses'; to how many must such a poem as 'The Two Voices' have brought
solace and light; how full of salutary lessons are the political poems
'You ask me, why, though ill at ease' and 'Love thou thy Land', and how
noble is their expression! And, even where the poems are less directly
didactic, it is such refreshment as busy life needs to converse with
them, so pure, so wholesome, so graciously human is their tone, so
tranquilly beautiful is their world. Who could lay down 'The Miller's
Daughter, Dora, The Golden Year, The Gardener's Daughter, The Talking
Oak, Audley Court, The Day Dream' without something of the feeling which
Goethe felt when he first laid down 'The Vicar of Wakefield?' In the
best lyrics in these volumes, such as 'Break, Break', and 'Move
Eastward', 'Happy Earth', the most fastidious of critics must recognise
flawless gems. In the two volumes of 1842 Tennyson carried to perfection
all that was best in his earlier poems, and displayed powers of which he
may have given some indication in his cruder efforts, but which must
certainly have exceeded the expectation of the most sanguine of his
rational admirers. These volumes justly gave him the first place among
the poets of his time, and that supremacy he maintained--in the opinion
of most--till the day of his death. It would be absurd to contend that
Tennyson's subsequent publications added nothing to the fame which will
be secured to him by these poems. But this at least is certain, that,
taken with 'In Memorium', they represent the crown and flower of his
achievement. What is best in them he never excelled and perhaps never
equalled. We should be the poorer, and much the poorer, for the loss of
anything which he produced subsequently, it is true; but would we
exchange half a dozen of the best of these poems or a score of the best
sections of 'In Memoriam' for all that he produced between 1850 and his
death?

[Footnote 1: In 'The Keepsake', "St. Agnes' Eve"; in 'The Tribute',
"Stanzas": "Oh! that 'twere possible". Between 1831 and 1832 he had
contributed to 'The Gem' three, "No more," "Anacreontics," and "A
Fragment"; in 'The Englishman's Magazine', a Sonnet; in 'The Yorkshire
Literary Annual', lines, "There are three things that fill my heart with
sighs"; in 'Friendship's Offering', lines, "Me my own fate".]

In surveying these poems two things must strike every one--their very
wide range and their very fragmentary character. There is scarcely any
side of life on which they do not touch, scarcely any phase of passion
and emotion to which they do not give exquisite expression. Take the
love poems: compare 'Fatima' with 'Isabel', 'The Miller's Daughter' with
'Locksley Hall', 'The Gardener's Daughter' with 'Madeline', or 'Mariana'
with Cleopatra in the 'Dream of Fair Women'. When did love find purer
and nobler expression than in 'Love and Duty?' When has sorrow found
utterance more perfect than in the verses 'To J. S '., or the passion for
the past than in 'Break, Break, Break', or revenge and jealousy than in
'The Sisters?' In 'The Two Voices', 'The Palace of Art' and 'The Vision
of Sin' we are in another sphere. They are appeals to the soul of man on
subjects of momentous concern to him. And each is a masterpiece. What is
proper to philosophy and what is proper to poetry have never perhaps
been so happily blended. They have all the sensuous charm of Keats, but
the prose of Hume could not have presented the truths which they are
designed to convey with more lucidity and precision. In that superb
fragment the 'Morte d'Arthur' we have many of the noblest attributes of
Epic poetry. '?none' is the perfection of the classical idyll, 'The
Gardener's Daughter' and the idylls that follow it of the romantic. 'Sir
Galahad' and 'St. Agnes' are in the vein of Keats and Coleridge, but
Keats and Coleridge have produced nothing more exquisite and nothing so
ethereal. 'The Lotos* Eaters' is perhaps the most purely delicious poem
ever written, the 'ne plus ultra' of sensuous loveliness, and yet the
poet who gave us that has given us also the political poems, poems as
trenchant and austerely dignified in style as they are pregnant with
practical wisdom. There is the same versatility displayed in the
trifles.

But all is fragmentary. No thread strings these jewels. They form a
collection of gems unset and unarranged. Without any system or any
definite scope they have nothing of that unity in diversity which is so
perceptible in the lyrics and minor poems of Goethe and Wordsworth.
Capricious as the gyrations of a sea-gull seem the poet's moods and
movements. We have now the reveries of a love-sick maiden, now the
picture of a soul wrestling with despair and death; here a study from
rural life, or a study in character, there a sermon on politics, or a
descent into the depths of psychological truth, or a sketch from nature.
But nothing could be more concentrated than the power employed to shape
each fragment into form. What Pope says of the 'Aeneid' may be applied
with very literal truth to these poems:--


  Finish'd the whole, and laboured every part
  With patient touches of unwearied art.


In the poems of 1842 we have the secret of Tennyson's eminence as a poet
as well as the secret of his limitations. He appears to have been
constitutionally deficient in what the Greeks called 'architektonike',
combination and disposition on a large scale. The measure of his power
as a constructive artist is given us in the poem in which the English
idylls may be said to culminate, namely, 'Enoch Arden'. 'In Memoriam'
and the 'Idylls of the King' have a sort of spiritual unity, but they
are a series of fragments tacked rather than fused together. It is the
same with 'Maud', and it is the same with 'The Princess'. His poems have
always a tendency to resolve themselves into a series of cameos: it is
only the short poems which have organic unity. A gift of felicitous and
musical expression which is absolutely marvellous; an instinctive
sympathy with what is best and most elevated in the sphere of ordinary
life, of ordinary thought and sentiment, of ordinary activity with
consummate representative power; a most rare faculty of seizing and
fixing in very perfect form what is commonly so inexpressible because so
impalpable and evanescent in emotion and expression; a power of catching
and rendering the charm of nature with a fidelity and vividness which
resemble magic; and lastly, unrivalled skill in choosing, repolishing
and remounting the gems which are our common inheritance from the past:
these are the gifts which will secure permanence for his work as long as
the English language lasts.

In his power of crystallising commonplaces he stands next to Pope, in
subtle felicity of expression beside Virgil. And, when he says of Virgil
that we find in his diction "all the grace of all the muses often
flowering in one lonely word," he says what is literally true of his own
work. As a master of style his place is in the first rank among English
classical poets. But his style is the perfection of art. His diction,
like the diction of Milton and Gray, resembles mosaic work. With a touch
here and a touch there, now from memory, now from unconscious
assimilation, inlaying here an epithet and there a phrase, adding,
subtracting, heightening, modifying, substituting one metaphor for
another, developing what is latent in the suggestive imagery of a
predecessor, laying under contribution the most intimate familiarity
with what is best in the literature of the ancient and modern world, the
unwearied artist toils patiently on till his precious mosaic work is
without a flaw. All the resources of rhetoric are employed to give
distinction to his style and every figure in rhetoric finds expression
in his diction: Hypallage as in


  _The pillard dusk_ Of sounding sycamores.

--_Audley Court_.


Paronomasia as in


  The seawind sang _Shrill, chill_ with flakes of foam.

--_Morte d'Arthur_.


Oxymoron as

  _Behold_ them _unbeheld, unheard Hear_ all.

--'?none'.


Hyperbaton as in

  The _dew-impearled_ winds of dawn.

--'Ode to Memory'.


Metonymy as in

  The _bright death_ quiver'd at the victim's throat.

--'Dream of Fair Women'.


or in

  For some three _careless moans_ The summer pilot of an empty heart.

--'Gardener's Daughter'.


No poet since Milton has employed what is known as Onomatopoeia with so
much effect. Not to go farther than the poems of 1842, we have in the
'Morte d'Arthur':--

  So all day long the noise of battle _rolled
  Among the mountains by the winter sea_;

or

  _Dry clashed_ his harness in the icy caves
  And _barren chasms_, and all to left and right
  The _bare black cliff clang'd round_ him, as he bas'd
  His feet _on juts of slippery crag that rang
  Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels_--

or the exquisite

  I heard the _water lapping on the crag_,
  And the _long ripple washing in the reeds_.

So in 'The Dying Swan',

  And _the wavy swell of the soughing reeds_.

See too the whole of 'Oriana' and the description of the dance at
the beginning of 'The Vision of Sin.'

Assonance, alliteration, the revival or adoption of obsolete and
provincial words, the transplantation of phrases and idioms from the
Greek and Latin languages, the employment of common words in uncommon
senses, all are pressed into the service of adding distinction to his
diction. His diction blends the two extremes of simplicity and
artificiality, but with such fine tact that this strange combination has
seldom the effect of incongruity. Longinus has remarked that "as the
fainter lustre of the stars is put out of sight by the all-encompassing
rays of the sun, so when sublimity sheds its light round the sophistries
of rhetoric they become invisible".[1] What Longinus says of "sublimity"
is equally true of sincerity and truthfulness in combination with
exquisitely harmonious expression. We have an illustration in Gray's
'Elegy'. Nothing could be more artificial than the style, but what poem
in the world appeals more directly to the heart and to the eye? It is
one thing to call art to the assistance of art, it is quite another
thing to call art to the assistance of nature. And this is what both
Gray and Tennyson do, and this is why their artificiality, so far from
shocking us, "passes in music out of sight". But this cannot be said of
Tennyson without reserve. At times his strained endeavours to give
distinction to his style by putting common things in an uncommon way led
him into intolerable affectation. Thus we have "the knightly growth that
fringed his lips" for a moustache, "azure pillars of the hearth" for
ascending smoke, "ambrosial orbs" for apples, "frayed magnificence" for
a shabby dress, "the secular abyss to come" for future ages, "the
sinless years that breathed beneath the Syrian blue" for the life of
Christ, "up went the hush'd amaze of hand and eye" for a gesture of
surprise, and the like. One of the worst instances is in 'In Memoriam',
where what is appropriate to the simple sentiment finds, as it should
do, corresponding simplicity of expression in the first couplet, to
collapse into the falsetto of strained artificiality in the second:--


  To rest beneath the clover sod
  That takes the sunshine and the rains,
  _Or where the kneeling hamlet drains
  The chalice of the grapes of God_.


An illustration of the same thing, almost as offensive, is in 'Enoch
Arden', where, in an otherwise studiously simple diction, Enoch's wares
as a fisherman become

  Enoch's _ocean spoil_
  In ocean-smelling osier.


But these peculiarities are less common in the earlier poems than in the
later: it was a vicious habit which grew on him.

But, if exception may sometimes be taken to his diction, no exception
can be taken to his rhythm. No English poet since Milton, Tennyson's
only superior in this respect, had a finer ear or a more consummate
mastery over all the resources of rhythmical expression. What colours
are to a painter rhythm is, in description, to the poet, and few have
rivalled, none have excelled Tennyson in this. Take the following:--


  And ghastly thro' the drizzling rain
  _On the bald street strikes the blank day_.

--'In Memoriam'.

See particularly 'In Memoriam', cvii., the lines beginning "Fiercely
flies," to "darken on the rolling brine": the description of the island
in 'Enoch Arden'; but specification is needless, it applies to all his
descriptive poetry. It is marvellous that he can produce such effects by
such simple means: a mere enumeration of particulars will often do it,
as here:--


  No gray old grange or lonely fold,
  Or low morass and whispering reed,
  Or simple style from mead to mead,
  Or sheep walk up the windy wold.

--'In Memoriam', c.

Or here:--


  The meal sacks on the whitened floor,
  The dark round of the dripping wheel,
  The very air about the door Made misty with the floating meal.

--'The Miller's Daughter'.


His blank verse is best described by negatives. It has not the endless
variety, the elasticity and freedom of Shakespeare's, it has not the
massiveness and majesty of Milton's, it has not the austere grandeur of
Wordsworth's at its best, it has not the wavy swell, "the linked
sweetness long drawn out" of Shelley's, but its distinguishing feature
is, if we may use the expression, its importunate beauty. What Coleridge
said of Claudian's style may be applied to it: "Every line, nay every
word stops, looks full in your face and asks and begs for praise". His
earlier blank verse is less elaborate and seemingly more spontaneous and
easy than his later. [2] But it is in his lyric verse that his rhythm is
seen in its greatest perfection. No English lyrics have more magic or
more haunting beauty, more of that which charms at once and charms for
ever.

In his description of nature he is incomparable. Take the following from
'The Dying Swan':--


  Some blue peaks in the distance rose,
  And white against the cold-white sky,
  Shone out their crowning snows.
  One willow over the river wept,
  And shook the wave as the wind did sigh;
  Above in the wind was the swallow,
  Chasing itself at its own wild will,


or the opening scene in '?none' and in 'The Lotos Eaters', or the
meadow scene in 'The Gardener's Daughter', or the conclusion of 'Audley
Court', or the forest scene in the 'Dream of Fair Women', or this stanza
in 'Mariana in the South':--


  There all in spaces rosy-bright
  Large Hesper glitter'd on her tears,
  And deepening through the silent spheres,
  Heaven over Heaven rose the night.


A single line, nay, a single word, and a scene is by magic before us, as
here where the sea is looked down upon from an immense height:--


  The _wrinkled_ sea beneath him _crawls_.

--'The Eagle'.


Or here of a ship at sea, in the distance:--


  And on through zones of light and shadow
  _Glimmer away to the lonely deep_.

--'To the Rev. F. D. Maurice'.


Or here of waters falling high up on mountains:--


  Their thousand _wreaths of dangling water-smoke_.

--'The Princess'.


Or of a water-fall seen at a distance:--


  And _like a downward smoke_ the slender stream
  Along the cliff _to fall and pause and fall_ did seem.


Or here again:--


  We left the dying ebb that _faintly lipp'd
  The flat red granite_.


Or here of a wave:--


  Like a wave in the wild North Sea
  _Green glimmering toward the summit_ bears with all
  _Its stormy crests that smoke_ against the skies
  Down on a bark.

--'Elaine'.


  That beech will _gather brown_,
  This _maple burn itself away_.

--'In Memoriam'.


  The _wide-wing'd sunset_ of the misty marsh.

--'Last Tournament'.


But illustrations would be endless. Nothing seems to escape him in
Nature. Take the following:--


  Like _a purple beech among the greens
  Looks out of place_.

--'Edwin Morris'.


Or

  Delays _as the tender ash delays
  To clothe herself, when all the woods are green_.

--'The Princess'.


  As _black as ash-buds in the front of March_.

--'The Gardener's Daughter'.


  A gusty April morn
  That _puff'd_ the swaying _branches into smoke_.

--'Holy Grail'.


So with flowers, trees, birds and insects:--


  The fox-glove _clusters dappled bells_.

--'The Two Voices'.


The sunflower:--


  _Rays round with flame its disk of seed_.

--'In Memoriam'.


The dog-rose:--


  _Tufts of rosy-tinted snow_.

--'Two Voices'.


  A _million emeralds_ break from the _ruby-budded lime_.

--'Maud'.


  In gloss and hue the chestnut, _when the shell
  Divides threefold to show the fruit within_.

--'The Brook'.


Or of a chrysalis:--


  And flash'd as those
  _Dull-coated_ things, _that making slide apart
  Their dusk wing cases, all beneath there burns
  A Jewell'd harness_, ere they pass and fly.

--'Gareth and Lynette'.

So again:--


  Wan-sallow, as _the plant that feeds itself,
  Root-bitten by white lichen_.

--'Id'.


And again:--


  All the _silvery gossamers_
  That _twinkle into green and gold_.

--'In Memoriam'.


His epithets are in themselves a study: "the _dewy-tassell'd_ wood,"
"the _tender-pencill'd_ shadow," "_crimson-circl'd_ star," the "_hoary_
clematis," "_creamy_ spray," "_dry-tongued_ laurels". But whatever he
describes is described with the same felicitous vividness. How magical
is this in the verses to Edward Lear:--


  Naiads oar'd
  A _glimmering shoulder_ under _gloom_
  Of _cavern pillars_.


Or this:--


  She lock'd her lips: she left me where I stood:
  "Glory to God," she sang, and past afar,
  Thridding the sombre boskage of the wood,
  Toward the morning-star.

--'A Dream of Fair Women'.


But if in the world of Nature nothing escaped his sensitive and
sympathetic observation,--and indeed it might be said of him as truly as
of Shelley's 'Alastor'


  Every sight
  And sound from the vast earth and ambient air
  Sent to his heart its choicest impulses,


--he had studied the world of books with not less sympathy and
attention. In the sense of a profound and extensive acquaintance with
all that is best in ancient and modern poetry, and in an extraordinarily
wide knowledge of general literature, of philosophy and theology, of
geography and travel, and of various branches of natural science, he is
one of the most erudite of English poets. With the poetry of the Greek
and Latin classics he was, like Milton and Gray, thoroughly saturated.
Its influence penetrates his work, now in indirect reminiscence, now in
direct imitation, now inspiring, now modifying, now moulding. He tells
us in 'The Daisy' how when at Como "the rich Virgilian rustic measure of
'Lari Maxume'" haunted him all day, and in a later fragment how, as he
rowed from Desenzano to Sirmio, Catullus was with him. And they and
their brethren, from Homer to Theocritus, from Lucretius to Claudian,
always were with him. I have illustrated so fully in the notes and
elsewhere [1] the influence of the Greek and Roman classics on the poems
of 1842 that it is not necessary to go into detail here. But a few
examples of the various ways in which they affected Tennyson's work
generally may be given. Sometimes he transfers a happy epithet or
expression in literal translation, as in:--


  On either _shining_ shoulder laid a hand,


which is Homer's epithet for the shoulder--


  [Greek: ana phaidimps omps]

--'Od'., xi., 128.



  It was the red cock _shouting_ to the light,


exactly the


  [Greek: heos eboaesen alektor] (Until the cock _shouted_).

--'Batrachomyomachia', 192.



  And all in passion utter'd a 'dry' shriek,


which is the 'sicca vox' of the Roman poets. So in 'The Lotos Eaters':--


  His voice was _thin_ as voices from the grave,


which is Theocritus' voice of Hylas from his watery grave:--


  [Greek: araia d' Iketo ph_ona]

  (_Thin_ came the voice).


So in 'The Princess', sect. i.:--


  And _cook'd his spleen_,


which is a phrase from the Greek, as in Homer, 'Il'., iv., 513:--

  [Greek: epi naeusi cholon thumalgea pessei]

  (At the ships he cooks his heart-grieving spleen).


Again in 'The Princess', sect. iv.:--

  _Laugh'd with alien lips_,


which is Homer's ('Od'., 69-70)--

  [Greek: did' aedae gnathmoisi gelps_on allotrioisi]


So in 'Edwin Morris'--

  All perfect, finished _to the finger nail_,

which is a phrase transferred from Latin through the Greek; 'cf.',
Horace, 'Sat'., i., v., 32:--

  _Ad unguem_ Factus homo

  (A man fashioned to the finger nail).


"The _brute_ earth," 'In Memoriam', cxxvii., which is Horace's

  _Bruta_ tellus.

--'Odes', i., xxxiv., 9.


So again:--

  A bevy of roses _apple-cheek'd_


in 'The Island', which is Theocritus' [Greek: maloparaeos].
The line in the 'Morte d'Arthur',

  This way and that, dividing the swift mind,


is an almost literal translation of Virgil's 'Aen'., iv., 285:--

  Atque animum nunc huc celerem nunc dividit illuc

 (And this way and that he divides his swift mind).


Another way in which they affect him is where, without direct imitation,
they colour passages and poems as in 'Oenone', 'The Lotos Eaters',
'Tithonus', 'Tiresias', 'The Death of Oenone', 'Demeter and Persephone',
the passage beginning "From the woods" in 'The Gardener's Daughter',
which is a parody of Theocritus, 'Id.', vii., 139 'seq.', while the
Cyclops' invocation to Galatea in Theocritus, 'Id.', xi., 29-79, was
plainly the model for the idyll, "Come down, O Maid," in the seventh
section of 'The Princess', just as the tournament in the same poem
recalls closely the epic of Homer and Virgil. Tennyson had a wonderful
way of transfusing, as it were, the essence of some beautiful passage in
a Greek or Roman poet into English. A striking illustration of this
would be the influence of reminiscences of Virgil's fourth 'Aeneid' on
the idyll of 'Elaine and Guinevere'. Compare, for instance, the
following: he is describing the love-wasted Elaine, as she sits brooding
in the lonely evening, with the shadow of the wished-for death falling
on her:--

  But when they left her to herself again,
  Death, like a friend's voice from a distant field,
  Approaching through the darkness, call'd; the owls
  Wailing had power upon her, and she mix'd
  Her fancies with the sallow-rifted glooms
  Of evening and the moanings of the wind.


How exactly does this recall, in a manner to be felt rather than exactly
defined, a passage equally exquisite and equally pathetic in Virgil's
picture of Dido, where, with the shadow of her death also falling upon
her, she seems to hear the phantom voice of her dead husband, and "mixes
her fancies" with the glooms of night and the owl's funereal wail:--

  Hinc exaudiri voces et verba vocantis
  Visa viri, nox quum terras obscura teneret;
  Solaque culminibus ferali carmine bubo
  Saepe queri, et longas in fletum ducere voces.

--'Aen'., iv., 460.

  (From it she thought she clearly heard a voice, even the accents of
  her husband calling her when night was wrapping the earth with
  darkness; and on the roof the lonely owl in funereal strains kept oft
  complaining, drawing out into a wail its protracted notes.)

Similar passages, though not so striking, would be the picture of
Pindar's Elysium in 'Tiresias', the sentiment pervading 'The Lotos
Eaters' transferred so faithfully from the Greek poets, the scenery in
'?none' so crowded with details from Homer, Theocritus and Callimachus.
Sometimes we find similes suggested by the classical poets, but enriched
by touches from original observation, as here in 'The Princess':--

  As one that climbs a peak to gaze
  O'er land and main, and sees a great black cloud
  Drag inward from the deeps, a wall of night
  Blot out the slope of sea from verge to shore.
  ...
  And quenching lake by lake and tarn by tarn Expunge the world,


which was plainly suggested by Homer, iv., 275:--

  [Greek: hos d' hot apo skopiaes eide nephos aipolos anaer
  erchomenon kata ponton hupo Zephuroio i_oaes tps de t' aneuthen eonti,
  melanteron aeute pissa, phainet ion kata ponton, agei de te lailapa
  pollaen.]

  (As when a goat-herd from some hill-peak sees a cloud coming across
  the deep with the blast of the west wind behind it; and to him, being
  as he is afar, it seems blacker, even as pitch, as it goes along the
  deep, bringing with it a great whirlwind.)


So again the fine simile in 'Elaine', beginning

  Bare as a wild wave in the wide North Sea,


is at least modelled on the simile in 'Iliad', xv., 381-4, with
reminiscences of the same similes in 'Iliad', xv., 624, and 'Iliad',
iv., 42-56. The simile in the first section of the 'Princess',

  As when a field of corn
  Bows all its ears before the roaring East,


reminds us of Homer's

  [Greek: hos d' ote kinaesae Zephyros Bathulaeion, elthon labros,
  epaigixon, epi t' aemuei astachuessin]

  (As when the west wind tosses a deep cornfield rushing down with
  furious blast, and it bows with all its ears.)


Nothing could be more happy than such an adaptation as the following--

  Ever fail'd to draw
  The quiet night into her blood,


from Virgil, 'Aen'., iv., 530:--

  Neque unquam Solvitur in somnos _oculisve aut pectore noctem
  Accipit_.

  (And she never relaxes into sleep, or receives the night in eyes or
  bosom),


or than the following (in 'Enid') from Theocritus:--

  Arms on which the standing muscle sloped,
  As slopes a wild brook o'er a little stone,
  Running too vehemently to break upon it.

  [Greek: en de mues stereoisi brachiosin akron hyp' _omon estasan,
  aeute petroi oloitrochoi ous te kylind_on cheimarrhous potamos
  megalais periexese dinais.]

--'Idyll', xxii., 48 'seq.'

  (And the muscles on his brawny arms close under the shoulder stood out
  like boulders which the wintry torrent has rolled and worn smooth with
  the mighty eddies.)

But there was another use to which Tennyson applied his accurate and
intimate acquaintance with the classics. It lay in developing what was
suggested by them, in unfolding, so to speak, what was furled in their
imagery. Nothing is more striking in ancient classical poetry than its
pregnant condensation. It often expresses in an epithet what might be
expanded into a detailed picture, or calls up in a single phrase a whole
scene or a whole position. Where in 'Merlin and Vivian' Tennyson
described

  The _blind wave feeling round his long sea hall
  In silence_,


he was merely unfolding to its full Homer's [Greek: kuma k_ophon]--"dumb
wave"; just as the best of all comments on Horace's expression, "Vultus
nimium lubricus aspici," 'Odes', I., xix., 8, is given us in Tennyson's
picture of the Oread in Lucretius:--


  How the sun delights
  To _glance and shift about her slippery sides_.

Or take again this passage in the 'Agamemnon', 404-5, describing
Menelaus pining in his desolate palace for the lost Helen:--

  [Greek: pothoi d' uperpontias phasma doxei dom_on anassein.]

  (And in his yearning love for her who is over the sea a phantom will
  seem to reign over his palace.)


What are the lines in 'Guinevere' but an expansion of what is latent but
unfolded in the pregnant suggestiveness of the Greek poet:--

  And in thy bowers of Camelot or of Usk
  Thy shadow still would glide from room to room,
  And I should evermore be vex'd with thee
  In hanging robe or vacant ornament,
  Or ghostly foot-fall echoing on the stair--


with a reminiscence also perhaps of Constance's speech in 'King John',
III., iv.

It need hardly be said that these particular passages, and possibly some
of the others, may be mere coincidences, but they illustrate what
numberless other passages which could be cited prove that Tennyson's
careful and meditative study of the Greek and Roman poets enabled him to
enrich his work by these felicitous adaptations.

He used those poets as his master Virgil used his Greek predecessors,
and what the elder Seneca said of Ovid, who had appropriated a line from
Virgil, might exactly be applied to Tennyson: "Fecisse quod in multis
aliis versibus Virgilius fecerat, non surripiendi causa sed palam
imitandi, hoc animo ut vellet agnosci".[4]

He had plainly studied with equal attention the chief Italian poets,
especially Dante, Petrarch, Ariosto and Tasso. On a passage in Dante he
founded his 'Ulysses', and imitations of that master are frequent
throughout his poems. 'In Memoriam', both in its general scheme as
well as in numberless particular passages, closely recalls Petrarch; and
Ariosto and Tasso have each influenced his work. In the poetry of his
own country nothing seems to have escaped him, either in the masters or
the minor poets.[5] To apply the term plagiarism to Tennyson's use of
his predecessors would be as absurd as to resolve some noble fabric into
its stones and bricks, and confounding the one with the other to taunt
the architect with appropriating an honour which belongs to the quarry
and the potter. Tennyson's method was exactly the method of two of the
greatest poets in the world, Virgil and Milton, of the poet who stands
second to Virgil in Roman poetry, Horace, of one of the most illustrious
of our own minor poets, Gray.

An artist more fastidious than Tennyson never existed. As scrupulous a
purist in language as Cicero, Chesterfield and Macaulay in prose, as
Virgil, Milton, and Leopardi in verse, his care extended to the nicest
minutiae of word-forms. Thus "ancle" is always spelt with a "c" when it
stands alone, with a "k" when used in compounds; thus he spelt "Idylls"
with one "l" in the short poems, with two "l's" in the epic poems; thus
the employment of "through" or "thro'," of "bad" or "bade," and the
retention or suppression of "e" in past participles are always carefully
studied. He took immense pains to avoid the clash of "s" with "s," and
to secure the predominance of open vowels when rhythm rendered them
appropriate. Like the Greek painter with his partridge, he thought
nothing of sacrificing good things if, in any way, they interfered with
unity and symmetry, and thus, his son tells us, many stanzas, in
themselves of exquisite beauty, have been lost to us.


[Footnote 1: 'De Sublimitate,' xvii.]

[Footnote 2: Tennyson's blank verse in the _Idylls of the King_
(excepting in the _Morte d'Arthur_ and in the grander passages), is
obviously modelled in rhythm on that of Shakespeare's earlier style seen
to perfection in _King John_. Compare the following lines with the
rhythm say of _Elaine_ or _Guinevere_;--

  But now will canker sorrow eat my bud,
  And chase the native beauty from his cheek,
  And he will look as hollow as a ghost;
  As dim and meagre as an ague's fit:
  And so he'll die; and, rising so again,
  When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
  I shall not know him: therefore never, never
  Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.

--_King John_, III., iv.]

[Footnote 3: 'Illustrations of Tennyson'.]

[Footnote 4: Seneca, third 'Suasoria'.]

[Footnote 5: For fuller illustrations of all this, and for the influence
of the ancient classics on Tennyson, I may perhaps venture to refer the
reader to my 'Illustrations of Tennyson'. And may I here take the
opportunity of pointing out that nothing could have been farther from my
intention in that book than what has so often been most unfairly
attributed to it, namely, an attempt to show that a charge of plagiarism
might be justly urged against Tennyson. No honest critic, who had even
cursorily inspected the book, could so utterly misrepresent its purpose.]






IV


Tennyson's place is not among the "lords of the visionary eye," among
seers, among prophets, but not the least part of the debt which his
countrymen owe to him is his dedication of his art to the noblest
purposes. At a time when poetry was beginning to degenerate into what it
has now almost universally become--a mere sense-pampering siren, and
when critics were telling us, as they are still telling us, that we are
to understand by it "all literary production which attains the power of
giving pleasure by its form as distinct from its matter," he remained
true to the creed of his great predecessors. "L'art pour art," he would
say, quoting Georges Sand, "est un vain mot: l'art pour le vrai, l'art
pour le beau et le bon, voila la religion que je cherche." When he
succeeded to the laureateship he was proud to remember that the wreath
which had descended to him was

  greener from the brows
  Of him that utter'd nothing base,

and he was a loyal disciple of that poet whose aim had been, in his own
words, "to console the afflicted, to add sunshine to daylight by making
the happy happier, to teach the young and the gracious of every age to
see, to think, to feel, and therefore to become more actively and
securely virtuous". [1] Wordsworth had said that he wished to be
regarded as a teacher or as nothing, but unhappily he did not always
distinguish between the way in which a poet and a philosopher should
teach. He forgot that the didactic element in a poem should be, to
employ a homely illustration, what garlic should be in a salad, "scarce
suspected, animate the whole," that the poet teaches not as the moralist
and the preacher teach, but as nature and life teach us. He taught us
when he wrote 'The Fountain' and 'The Highland Reaper, The
Leach-gatherer' and 'Michael', he merely wearied us when he sermonised
in 'The Excursion' and in 'The Prelude'. Tennyson never makes this
mistake. He is seldom directly didactic. Would he inculcate subjugation
to the law of duty--he gives us the funeral ode on Wellington, 'The
Charge of the Light Brigade', and 'Love and Duty'. Would he inculcate
resignation to the will of God, and the moral efficacy of conventional
Christianity--he gives us 'Enoch Arden'. Would he picture the endless
struggle between the sensual and the spiritual, and the relation of
ideals to life--he gives us the 'Idylls of the King'. Would he point to
what atheism may lead--he gives us 'Lucretius'. Poems which are
masterpieces of sensuous art, such as mere aesthetes, like Rosetti and
his school, must contemplate with admiring despair, he makes vehicles of
the most serious moral and spiritual teaching. 'The Vision of Sin' is
worth a hundred sermons on the disastrous effects of unbridled
profligacy. In 'The Palace of Art' we have the quintessence of 'The Book
of Ecclesiastes' and much more besides. Even in 'The Lotos Eaters' we
have the mirror held up to Hedonism. On the education of the affections
and on the purity of domestic life must depend very largely, not merely
the happiness of individuals, but the well-being of society, and how
wide a space is filled by poems in Tennyson's works bearing
influentially on these subjects is obvious. And they admit us into a
pleasaunce with which it is good to be familiar, so pure and wholesome
is their atmosphere, so tranquilly beautiful the world in which the
characters move and the little dramas unfold themselves. They preach
nothing, but deep into every heart must sink their silent lessons. "Upon
the sacredness of home life," writes his son, "he would maintain that
the stability and greatness of a nation largely depend; and one of the
secrets of his power over mankind was his true joy in the family duties
and affections." What sermons have we in 'The Miller's Daughter', in
'Dora', in 'The Gardener's Daughter' and in 'Love and Duty'. 'The
Princess' was a direct contribution to a social question of momentous
importance to our time. 'Maud' had an immediate political purpose, while
in 'In Memoriam' he became the interpreter and teacher of his generation
in a still higher sense.

Since Shakespeare no English poet has been so essentially patriotic, or
appealed so directly to the political conscience of the nation. In his
noble eulogies of the English constitution and of the virtue and wisdom
of its architects, in his spirit-stirring pictures of the heroic actions
of our forefathers and contemporaries both by land and sea, in his
passionate denunciations of all that he believed would detract from
England's greatness and be prejudicial to her real interests, in his
hearty sympathy with every movement and with every measure which he
believed would contribute to her honour and her power, in all this he
stands alone among modern poets. But if he loved England as Shakespeare
loved her, he had other lessons than Shakespeare's to teach her. The
responsibilities imposed on the England of our time--and no poet knew
this better--are very different from those imposed on the England of
Elizabeth. An empire vaster and more populous than that of the Caesars
has since then been added to our dominion. Millions, indeed, who are of
the same blood as ourselves and who speak our language have, by the
folly of common ancestors, become aliens. But how immense are the realms
peopled by the colonies which are still loyal to us, and by the three
hundred millions who in India own us as their rulers: of this vast
empire England is now the capital and centre. That she should fulfil
completely and honourably the duties to which destiny has called her
will be the prayer of every patriot, that he should by his own efforts
contribute all in his power to further such fulfilment must be his
earnest desire. It would be no exaggeration to say that Tennyson
contributed more than any man who has ever lived to what may be called
the higher political education of the English-speaking races. Of
imperial federation he was at once the apostle and the pioneer. In
poetry which appealed as probably no other poetry has appealed to every
class, wherever our language is spoken, he dwelt fondly on all that
constitutes the greatness and glory of England, on her grandeur in the
past, on the magnificent promise of the part she will play in the
future, if her sons are true to her. There should be no distinction, for
she recognises no distinction between her children at home and her
children in her colonies. She is the common mother of a common race: one
flag, one sceptre, the same proud ancestry, the same splendid
inheritance. "How strange England cannot see," he once wrote, "that her
true policy lies in a close union with her colonies."

  Sharers of our glorious past,
  Shall we not thro' good and ill
  Cleave to one another still?
  Britain's myriad voices call,
  Sons be welded all and all
  Into one imperial whole,
  One with Britain, heart and soul!
  One life, one flag, one fleet, one Throne!

Thus did the poetry of Tennyson draw closer, and thus will it continue
to draw closer those sentimental ties--ties, in Burke's phrase, "light
as air, but strong as links of iron," which bind the colonies to the
mother country; and in so doing, if he did not actually initiate, he
furthered, as no other single man has furthered, the most important
movement of our time. Nor has any man of genius in the present
century--not Dickens, not Ruskin--been moved by a purer spirit of
philanthropy, or done more to show how little the qualities and actions
which dignify humanity depend, or need depend, on the accidents of
fortune. He brought poetry into touch with the discoveries of science,
and with the speculations of theology and metaphysics, and though, in
treating such subjects, his power is not, perhaps, equal to his charm,
the debt which his countrymen owe him, even intellectually, is
incalculable.

BIBLIOGRAPHY OF THE POEMS OF 1842





TO THE QUEEN

This dedication was first prefixed to the seventh edition of these poems
in 1851, Tennyson having succeeded Wordsworth as Poet Laureate, 19th
Nov., 1850.

  Revered, beloved [1]--O you that hold
  A nobler office upon earth
  Than arms, or power of brain, or birth
  Could give the warrior kings of old,

  Victoria, [2]--since your Royal grace
  To one of less desert allows
  This laurel greener from the brows
  Of him that utter'd nothing base;

  And should your greatness, and the care
  That yokes with empire, yield you time
  To make demand of modern rhyme
  If aught of ancient worth be there;

  Then--while [3] a sweeter music wakes,
  And thro' wild March the throstle calls,
  Where all about your palace-walls
  The sun-lit almond-blossom shakes--

  Take, Madam, this poor book of song;
  For tho' the faults were thick as dust
  In vacant chambers, I could trust
  Your kindness. [4] May you rule us long.

  And leave us rulers of your blood
  As noble till the latest day!
  May children of our children say,
  "She wrought her people lasting good; [5]

  "Her court was pure; her life serene;
  God gave her peace; her land reposed;
  A thousand claims to reverence closed
  In her as Mother, Wife and Queen;

  "And statesmen at her council met
  Who knew the seasons, when to take
  Occasion by the hand, and make
  The bounds of freedom wider yet [6]

  "By shaping some august decree,
  Which kept her throne unshaken still,
  Broad-based upon her people's will, [7]
  And compass'd by the inviolate sea."

  MARCH, 1851.


[Footnote 1: 1851. Revered Victoria, you that hold.]

[Footnote 2: 1851. I thank you that your Royal grace.]

[Footnote 3: This stanza added in 1853.]

[Footnote 4: 1851. Your sweetness.]

[Footnote 5: In 1851 the following stanza referring to the first Crystal
Palace, opened 1st May, 1851, was inserted here:--

  She brought a vast design to pass,
  When Europe and the scatter'd ends
  Of our fierce world were mixt as friends
  And brethren, in her halls of glass.]

[Footnote 6: 1851. Broader yet.]

[Footnote 7: With this cf. Shelley, 'Ode to Liberty':--

  Athens diviner yet
  Gleam'd with its crest of columns _on the will_
  Of man.]





CLARIBEL

A MELODY


First published in 1830.

In 1830 and in 1842 edd. the poem is in one long stanza, with a full
stop in 1830 ed. after line 8; 1842 ed. omits the full stop. The name
"Claribel" may have been suggested by Spenser ('F. Q.', ii., iv., or
Shakespeare, 'Tempest').


1

  Where Claribel low-lieth
  The breezes pause and die,
  Letting the rose-leaves fall:
  But the solemn oak-tree sigheth,
  Thick-leaved, ambrosial,
  With an ancient melody
  Of an inward agony,
  Where Claribel low-lieth.

2

  At eve the beetle boometh
  Athwart the thicket lone:
  At noon the wild bee [1] hummeth
  About the moss'd headstone:
  At midnight the moon cometh,
  And looketh down alone.
  Her song the lintwhite swelleth,
  The clear-voiced mavis dwelleth,
  The callow throstle [2] lispeth,
  The slumbrous wave outwelleth,
  The babbling runnel crispeth,
  The hollow grot replieth
  Where Claribel low-lieth.


[Footnote 1: 1830. "Wild" omitted, and "low" inserted with a hyphen
before "hummeth".]

[Footnote 2: 1851 and all previous editions, "fledgling" for "callow".]





LILIAN

First printed in 1830.

1

  Airy, fairy Lilian,
  Flitting, fairy Lilian,
  When I ask her if she love me,
  Claps her tiny hands above me,
  Laughing all she can;
  She'll not tell me if she love me,
  Cruel little Lilian.


2

  When my passion seeks
  Pleasance in love-sighs
  She, looking thro' and thro' [1] me
  Thoroughly to undo me,
  Smiling, never speaks:
  So innocent-arch, so cunning-simple,
  From beneath her gather'd wimple [2]
  Glancing with black-beaded eyes,
  Till the lightning laughters dimple
  The baby-roses in her cheeks;
  Then away she flies.


3

  Prythee weep, May Lilian!
  Gaiety without eclipse
  Wearieth me, May Lilian:
  Thro' [3] my very heart it thrilleth
  When from crimson-threaded [4] lips
  Silver-treble laughter [5] trilleth:
  Prythee weep, May Lilian.


4

  Praying all I can,
  If prayers will not hush thee,
  Airy Lilian,
  Like a rose-leaf I will crush thee,
  Fairy Lilian.


[Footnote 1: 1830. Through and through me.]

[Footnote 2: 1830. Purfled.]

[Footnote 3: 1830. Through.]

[Footnote 4: With "crimson-threaded" 'cf.' Cleveland's 'Sing-song on
Clarinda's Wedding', "Her 'lips those threads of scarlet dye'"; but the
original is 'Solomons Song' iv. 3, "Thy lips are 'like a thread of
scarlet'".]

[Footnote 5: 1830. Silver treble-laughter.]





ISABEL

First printed in 1830.

Lord Tennyson tells us ('Life of Tennyson', i., 43) that in this poem
his father more or less described his own mother, who was a "remarkable
and saintly woman". In this as in the other poems elaborately painting
women we may perhaps suspect the influence of Wordsworth's 'Triad',
which should be compared with them.


1

  Eyes not down-dropt nor over-bright, but fed
  With the clear-pointed flame of chastity,
  Clear, without heat, undying, tended by
  Pure vestal thoughts in the translucent fane
  Of her still spirit [1]; locks not wide-dispread,
  Madonna-wise on either side her head;
  Sweet lips whereon perpetually did reign
  The summer calm of golden charity,
  Were fixed shadows of thy fixed mood,
  Revered Isabel, the crown and head,
  The stately flower of female fortitude,
  Of perfect wifehood and pure lowlihead. [2]


2

  The intuitive decision of a bright
  And thorough-edged intellect to part
  Error from crime; a prudence to withhold;
  The laws of marriage [3] character'd in gold
  Upon the blanched [4] tablets of her heart;
  A love still burning upward, giving light
  To read those laws; an accent very low
  In blandishment, but a most silver flow
  Of subtle-paced counsel in distress,
  Right to the heart and brain, tho' undescried,
  Winning its way with extreme gentleness
  Thro' [5] all the outworks of suspicious pride.
  A courage to endure and to obey;
  A hate of gossip parlance, and of sway,
  Crown'd Isabel, thro' [6] all her placid life,
  The queen of marriage, a most perfect wife.


3


  The mellow'd reflex of a winter moon;
  A clear stream flowing with a muddy one,
  Till in its onward current it absorbs
  With swifter movement and in purer light
  The vexed eddies of its wayward brother:
  A leaning and upbearing parasite,
  Clothing the stem, which else had fallen quite,
  With cluster'd flower-bells and ambrosial orbs
  Of rich fruit-bunches leaning on each other--
  Shadow forth thee:--the world hath not another
  (Though all her fairest forms are types of thee,
  And thou of God in thy great charity)
  Of such a finish'd chasten'd purity,


[Footnote 1: With these lines may be compared Shelley, 'Dedication to
the Revolt of Islam':--

  And through thine eyes, e'en in thy soul, I see
  A lamp of vestal fire burning eternally.]


[Footnote 2: Lowlihead a favourite word with Chaucer and Spenser.]

[Footnote 3: 1830. Wifehood.]

[Footnote 4: 1830. Blenched.]

[Footnote 5: 1830 and all before 1853. Through.]

[Footnote 6: 1830. Through.]




MARIANA

"Mariana in the moated grange."--'Measure for Measure'.

First printed in 1830.


This poem as we know from the motto prefixed to it was suggested by
Shakespeare ('Measure for Measure', iii., 1, "at the moated grange
resides this dejected Mariana,") but the poet may have had in his mind
the  exquisite fragment of Sappho:--

  [Greek: deduke men ha selanna kai Plaeiades, mesai de nuktes, para d'
  erchet h'ora ego de mona kateud'o.]

  "The moon has set and the Pleiades, and it is midnight: the hour too
  is going by, but I sleep alone."

It was long popularly supposed that the scene of the poem was a farm
near Somersby known as Baumber's farm, but Tennyson denied this and said
it was a purely "imaginary house in the fen," and that he "never so much
as dreamed of Baumbers farm". See 'Life', i., 28.



  With blackest moss the flower-plots
  Were thickly crusted, one and all:
  The rusted nails fell from the knots
  That held the peach [1] to the garden-wall. [2]
  The broken sheds look'd sad and strange:
  Unlifted was the clinking latch;
  Weeded and worn the ancient thatch
  Upon the lonely moated grange.
  She only said, "My life is dreary,
  He cometh not," she said;
  She said, "I am aweary, aweary,
  I would that I were dead!"

  Her tears fell with the dews at even;
  Her tears fell ere the dews were dried; [3]
  She could not look on the sweet heaven,
  Either at morn or eventide.
  After the flitting of the bats,
  When thickest dark did trance the sky,
  She drew her casement-curtain by,
  And glanced athwart the glooming flats.
  She only said, "The night is dreary,
  He cometh not," she said;
  She said, "I am aweary, aweary,
  I would that I were dead!"

  Upon the middle of the night,
  Waking she heard the night-fowl crow:
  The cock sung out an hour ere light:
  From the dark fen the oxen's low
  Came to her: without hope of change,
  In sleep she seem'd to walk forlorn,
  Till cold winds woke the gray-eyed [4] morn
  About the lonely moated grange.
  She only said, "The day is dreary,
  He cometh not," she said;
  She said, "I am aweary, aweary,
  I would that I were dead!"

  About a stone-cast from the wall
  A sluice with blacken'd waters slept,
  And o'er it many, round and small,
  The cluster'd marish-mosses crept.
  Hard by a poplar shook alway,
  All silver-green with gnarled bark:
  For leagues no other tree did mark [5]
  The level waste, the rounding gray.[6]
  She only said, "My life is dreary,
  He cometh not," she said;
  She said, "I am aweary, aweary,
  I would that I were dead!"

  And ever when the moon was low,
  And the shrill winds were up and away,[7]
  In the white curtain, to and fro,
  She saw the gusty shadow sway.
  But when the moon was very low,
  And wild winds bound within their cell,
  The shadow of the poplar fell
  Upon her bed, across her brow.
  She only said, "The night is dreary,
  He cometh not," she said;
  She said, "I am aweary, aweary,
  I would that I were dead!"

  All day within the dreamy house,
  The doors upon their hinges creak'd;
  The blue fly sung in the pane; [8] the mouse
  Behind the mouldering wainscot shriek'd,
  Or from the crevice peer'd about.
  Old faces glimmer'd thro' the doors,
  Old footsteps trod the upper floors,
  Old voices called her from without.
  She only said, "My life is dreary,
  He cometh not," she said;
  She said, "I am aweary, aweary,
  I would that I were dead!"

  The sparrow's chirrup on the roof,
  The slow clock ticking, and the sound,
  Which to the wooing wind aloof
  The poplar made, did all confound
  Her sense; but most she loathed the hour
  When the thick-moted sunbeam lay
  Athwart the chambers, and the day
  Was sloping [9] toward his western bower.
  Then, said she, "I am very dreary,
  He will not come," she said;
  She wept, "I am aweary, aweary,
  O God, that I were dead!".

TO----

First printed in 1830.

The friend to whom these verses were addressed was Joseph William
Blakesley, third Classic and Senior Chancellor's Medallist in 1831, and
afterwards Dean of Lincoln. Tennyson said of him: "He ought to be Lord
Chancellor, for he is a subtle and powerful reasoner, and an honest
man".--'Life', i., 65. He was a contributor to the 'Edinburgh' and
'Quarterly Reviews', and died in April, 1885. See memoir of him in the
'Dictionary of National Biography'.


1

  Clear-headed friend, whose joyful scorn,
  Edged with sharp laughter, cuts atwain
  The knots that tangle human creeds, [1]
  The wounding cords that [2] bind and strain
  The heart until it bleeds,
  Ray-fringed eyelids of the morn
  Roof not a glance so keen as thine:
  If aught of prophecy be mine,
  Thou wilt not live in vain.


2

  Low-cowering shall the Sophist sit;
  Falsehood shall bear her plaited brow:
  Fair-fronted Truth shall droop not now
  With shrilling shafts of subtle wit.
  Nor martyr-flames, nor trenchant swords
  Can do away that ancient lie;
  A gentler death shall Falsehood die,
  Shot thro' and thro'[3] with cunning words.


3

  Weak Truth a-leaning on her crutch,
  Wan, wasted Truth in her utmost need,
  Thy kingly intellect shall feed,
  Until she be an athlete bold,
  And weary with a finger's touch
  Those writhed limbs of lightning speed;
  Like that strange angel [4] which of old,
  Until the breaking of the light,
  Wrestled with wandering Israel,
  Past Yabbok brook the livelong night,
  And heaven's mazed signs stood still
  In the dim tract of Penuel.

[Footnote 2: 1830. "Which" for "that".]

MADELINE

First published in 1830.


1

Thou art not steep'd in golden languors,
No tranced summer calm is thine,
Ever varying Madeline.
Thro' [1] light and shadow thou dost range,
Sudden glances, sweet and strange,
Delicious spites and darling angers,
And airy [2] forms of flitting change.


2

Smiling, frowning, evermore,
Thou art perfect in love-lore.
Revealings deep and clear are thine
Of wealthy smiles: but who may know
Whether smile or frown be fleeter?
Whether smile or frown be sweeter,
Who may know?
Frowns perfect-sweet along the brow
Light-glooming over eyes divine,
Like little clouds sun-fringed, are thine,
Ever varying Madeline.
Thy smile and frown are not aloof
From one another,
Each to each is dearest brother;
Hues of the silken sheeny woof
Momently shot into each other.
All the mystery is thine;
Smiling, frowning, evermore,
Thou art perfect in love-lore,
Ever varying Madeline.


3

A subtle, sudden flame,
By veering passion fann'd,
About thee breaks and dances
When I would kiss thy hand,
The flush of anger'd shame
O'erflows thy calmer glances,
And o'er black brows drops down
A sudden curved frown:
But when I turn away,
Thou, willing me to stay,
Wooest not, nor vainly wranglest;
But, looking fixedly the while,
All my bounding heart entanglest
In a golden-netted smile;
Then in madness and in bliss,
If my lips should dare to kiss
Thy taper fingers amorously, [3]
Again thou blushest angerly;
And o'er black brows drops down
A sudden-curved frown.


[Footnote 1: 1830. Through.]

[Footnote 2: 1830. Aery.]

[Footnote 3: 1830. Three-times-three; though noted as an _erratum_ for
amorously.]






SONG.--THE OWL

First printed in 1830.


1

  When cats run home and light is come,
  And dew is cold upon the ground,
  And the far-off stream is dumb,
  And the whirring sail goes round,
  And the whirring sail goes round;
  Alone and warming his five wits,
  The white owl in the belfry sits.


2

  When merry milkmaids click the latch,
  And rarely smells the new-mown hay,
  And the cock hath sung beneath the thatch
  Twice or thrice his roundelay,
  Twice or thrice his roundelay;
  Alone and warming his five wits,
  The white owl in the belfry sits.






SECOND SONG

TO THE SAME.

First printed in 1830.


1

  Thy tuwhits are lull'd I wot,
  Thy tuwhoos of yesternight,
  Which upon the dark afloat,
  So took echo with delight,
  So took echo with delight,
  That her voice untuneful grown,
  Wears all day a fainter tone.


2

  I would mock thy chaunt anew;
  But I cannot mimick it;
  Not a whit of thy tuwhoo,
  Thee to woo to thy tuwhit,
  Thee to woo to thy tuwhit,
  With a lengthen'd loud halloo,
  Tuwhoo, tuwhit, tuwhit, tuwhoo-o-o.






RECOLLECTIONS OF THE ARABIAN NIGHTS


First printed in 1830.

With this poem should be compared the description of Harun al Rashid's
Garden of Gladness in the story of Nur-al-din Ali and the damsel Anis al
Talis in the Thirty-Sixth Night. The style appears to have been modelled
on Coleridge's 'Kubla Khan' and 'Lewti', and the influence of Coleridge
is very perceptible throughout the poem.


  When the breeze of a joyful dawn blew free
  In the silken sail of infancy,
  The tide of time flow'd back with me,
  The forward-flowing tide of time;
  And many a sheeny summer-morn,
  Adown the Tigris I was borne,
  By Bagdat's shrines of fretted gold,
  High-walled gardens green and old;
  True Mussulman was I and sworn,
  For it was in the golden prime [1]
  Of good Haroun Alraschid.

  Anight my shallop, rustling thro' [2]
  The low and bloomed foliage, drove
  The fragrant, glistening deeps, and clove
  The citron-shadows in the blue:
  By garden porches on the brim,
  The costly doors flung open wide,
  Gold glittering thro' [3] lamplight dim,
  And broider'd sofas [4] on each side:
  In sooth it was a goodly time,
  For it was in the golden prime
  Of good Haroun Alraschid.

  Often, where clear-stemm'd platans guard
  The outlet, did I turn away
  The boat-head down a broad canal
  From the main river sluiced, where all
  The sloping of the moon-lit sward
  Was damask-work, and deep inlay
  Of braided blooms [5] unmown, which crept
  Adown to where the waters slept.
  A goodly place, a goodly time,
  For it was in the golden prime
  Of good Haroun Alraschid.

  A motion from the river won
  Ridged the smooth level, bearing on
  My shallop thro' the star-strown calm,
  Until another night in night
  I enter'd, from the clearer light,
  Imbower'd vaults of pillar'd palm,
  Imprisoning sweets, which, as they clomb
  Heavenward, were stay'd beneath the dome
  Of hollow boughs.--A goodly time,
  For it was in the golden prime
  Of good Haroun Alraschid.

  Still onward; and the clear canal
  Is rounded to as clear a lake.
  From the green rivage many a fall
  Of diamond rillets musical,
  Thro' little crystal [6] arches low
  Down from the central fountain's flow
  Fall'n silver-chiming, seem'd to shake
  The sparkling flints beneath the prow.
  A goodly place, a goodly time,
  For it was in the golden prime
  Of good Haroun Alraschid.

  Above thro' [7] many a bowery turn
  A walk with vary-colour'd shells
  Wander'd engrain'd. On either side
  All round about the fragrant marge
  From fluted vase, and brazen urn
  In order, eastern flowers large,
  Some dropping low their crimson bells
  Half-closed, and others studded wide
  With disks and tiars, fed the time
  With odour in the golden prime
  Of good Haroun Alraschid.

  Far off, and where the lemon-grove
  In closest coverture upsprung,
  The living airs of middle night
  Died round the bulbul [8] as he sung;
  Not he: but something which possess'd
  The darkness of the world, delight,
  Life, anguish, death, immortal love,
  Ceasing not, mingled, unrepress'd.
  Apart from place, withholding [9] time,
  But flattering the golden prime
  Of good Haroun Alraschid.

  Black the [10] garden-bowers and grots
  Slumber'd: the solemn palms were ranged
  Above, unwoo'd of summer wind:
  A sudden splendour from behind
  Flush'd all the leaves with rich gold-green,
  And, flowing rapidly between
  Their interspaces, counterchanged
  The level lake with diamond-plots
  Of dark and bright. [11] A lovely time,
  For it was in the golden prime
  Of good Haroun Alraschid.

  Dark-blue the deep sphere overhead,
  Distinct with vivid stars inlaid, [12]
  Grew darker from that under-flame:
  So, leaping lightly from the boat,
  With silver anchor left afloat,
  In marvel whence that glory came
  Upon me, as in sleep I sank
  In cool soft turf upon the bank,
  Entranced with that place and time,
  So worthy of the golden prime
  Of good Haroun Alraschid.


  Thence thro' the garden I was drawn--[13]
  A realm of pleasance, many a mound,
  And many a shadow-chequer'd lawn
  Full of the city's stilly sound, [14]
  And deep myrrh-thickets blowing round
  The stately cedar, tamarisks,
  Thick rosaries [15] of scented thorn,
  Tall orient shrubs, and obelisks
  Graven with emblems of the time,
  In honour of the golden prime
  Of good Haroun Alraschid.

  With dazed vision unawares
  From the long alley's latticed shade
  Emerged, I came upon the great
  Pavilion of the Caliphat.
  Right to the carven cedarn doors,
  Flung inward over spangled floors,
  Broad-based flights of marble stairs
  Ran up with golden balustrade,
  After the fashion of the time,
  And humour of the golden prime
  Of good Haroun Alraschid.

  The fourscore windows all alight
  As with the quintessence of flame,
  A million tapers flaring bright
  From twisted silvers look'd [16] to shame
  The hollow-vaulted dark, and stream'd
  Upon the mooned domes aloof
  In inmost Bagdat, till there seem'd
  Hundreds of crescents on the roof
  Of night new-risen, that marvellous time,
  To celebrate the golden prime
  Of good Haroun Alraschid.

  Then stole I up, and trancedly
  Gazed on the Persian girl alone,
  Serene with argent-lidded eyes
  Amorous, and lashes like to rays
  Of darkness, and a brow of pearl
  Tressed with redolent ebony,
  In many a dark delicious curl,
  Flowing beneath [17] her rose-hued zone;
  The sweetest lady of the time,
  Well worthy of the golden prime
  Of good Haroun Alraschid.

  Six columns, three on either side,
  Pure silver, underpropt [18] a rich
  Throne of the [19] massive ore, from which
  Down-droop'd, in many a floating fold,
  Engarlanded and diaper'd
  With inwrought flowers, a cloth of gold.
  Thereon, his deep eye laughter-stirr'd
  With merriment of kingly pride,
  Sole star of all that place and time,
  I saw him--in his golden prime,
  THE GOOD HAROUN ALRASCHID!

ODE TO MEMORY

First printed in 1830.

After the title in 1830 ed. is "Written very early in life". The
influence most perceptible in this poem is plainly Coleridge, on whose
'Songs of the Pixies' it seems to have been modelled. Tennyson
considered it, and no wonder, as one of the very best of "his early and
peculiarly concentrated Nature-poems". See 'Life', i., 27. It is full
of vivid and accurate pictures of his Lincolnshire home and haunts. See
'Life', i., 25-48, 'passim'.


1

  Thou who stealest fire,
  From the fountains of the past,
  To glorify the present; oh, haste,
  Visit my low desire!
  Strengthen me, enlighten me!
  I faint in this obscurity,
  Thou dewy dawn of memory.


2

  Come not as thou camest [1] of late,
  Flinging the gloom of yesternight
  On the white day; but robed in soften'd light
  Of orient state.
  Whilome thou camest with the morning mist,
  Even as a maid, whose stately brow
  The dew-impearled winds of dawn have kiss'd, [2]
  When she, as thou,
  Stays on her floating locks the lovely freight
  Of overflowing blooms, and earliest shoots
  Of orient green, giving safe pledge of fruits,
  Which in wintertide shall star
  The black earth with brilliance rare.


3

  Whilome thou camest with the morning mist.
  And with the evening cloud,
  Showering thy gleaned wealth into my open breast,
  (Those peerless flowers which in the rudest wind
  Never grow sere,
  When rooted in the garden of the mind,
  Because they are the earliest of the year).
  Nor was the night thy shroud.
  In sweet dreams softer than unbroken rest
  Thou leddest by the hand thine infant Hope.
  The eddying of her garments caught from thee
  The light of thy great presence; and the cope
  Of the half-attain'd futurity,
  Though deep not fathomless,
  Was cloven with the million stars which tremble
  O'er the deep mind of dauntless infancy.
  Small thought was there of life's distress;
  For sure she deem'd no mist of earth could dull
  Those spirit-thrilling eyes so keen and beautiful:
  Sure she was nigher to heaven's spheres,
  Listening the lordly music flowing from
  The illimitable years.[3]
  O strengthen me, enlighten me!
  I faint in this obscurity,
  Thou dewy dawn of memory.


4

  Come forth I charge thee, arise,
  Thou of the many tongues, the myriad eyes!
  Thou comest not with shows of flaunting vines
  Unto mine inner eye,
  Divinest Memory!
  Thou wert not nursed by the waterfall
  Which ever sounds and shines
  A pillar of white light upon the wall
  Of purple cliffs, aloof descried:
  Come from the woods that belt the grey hill-side,
  The seven elms, the poplars [4] four
  That stand beside my father's door,
  And chiefly from the brook [5] that loves
  To purl o'er matted cress and ribbed sand,
  Or dimple in the dark of rushy coves,
  Drawing into his narrow earthen urn,
  In every elbow and turn,
  The filter'd tribute of the rough woodland.
  O! hither lead thy feet!
  Pour round mine ears the livelong bleat
  Of the thick-fleeced sheep from wattled folds,
  Upon the ridged wolds,
  When the first matin-song hath waken'd [6] loud
  Over the dark dewy earth forlorn,
  What time the amber morn
  Forth gushes from beneath a low-hung cloud.


5

  Large dowries doth the raptured eye
  To the young spirit present
  When first she is wed;
  And like a bride of old
  In triumph led,
  With music and sweet showers
  Of festal flowers,
  Unto the dwelling she must sway.
  Well hast thou done, great artist Memory,
  In setting round thy first experiment
  With royal frame-work of wrought gold;
  Needs must thou dearly love thy first essay,
  And foremost in thy various gallery
  Place it, where sweetest sunlight falls
  Upon the storied walls;
  For the discovery
  And newness of thine art so pleased thee,
  That all which thou hast drawn of fairest
  Or boldest since, but lightly weighs
  With thee unto the love thou bearest
  The first-born of thy genius.
  Artist-like,
  Ever retiring thou dost gaze
  On the prime labour of thine early days:
  No matter what the sketch might be;
  Whether the high field on the bushless Pike,
  Or even a sand-built ridge
  Of heaped hills that mound the sea,
  Overblown with murmurs harsh,
  Or even a lowly cottage [7] whence we see
  Stretch'd wide and wild the waste enormous marsh,
  Where from the frequent bridge,
  Like emblems of infinity, [8]
  The trenched waters run from sky to sky;
  Or a garden bower'd close
  With plaited [9] alleys of the trailing rose,
  Long alleys falling down to twilight grots,
  Or opening upon level plots
  Of crowned lilies, standing near
  Purple-spiked lavender:
  Whither in after life retired
  From brawling storms,
  From weary wind,
  With youthful fancy reinspired,
  We may hold converse with all forms
  Of the many-sided mind,
  And those [10] whom passion hath not blinded,
  Subtle-thoughted, myriad-minded.
  My friend, with you [11] to live alone,
  Were how much [12] better than to own
  A crown, a sceptre, and a throne!
  O strengthen, enlighten me!
  I faint in this obscurity,
  Thou dewy dawn of memory.

SONG

First printed in 1830.

The poem was written in the garden at the Old Rectory, Somersby; an
autumn scene there which it faithfully describes. This poem seems to
have haunted Poe, a fervent admirer of Tennyson's early poems.


1

  A Spirit haunts the year's last hours
  Dwelling amid these yellowing bowers:
  To himself he talks;
  For at eventide, listening earnestly,
  At his work you may hear him sob and sigh
  In the walks;
  Earthward he boweth the heavy stalks
  Of the mouldering flowers:
  Heavily hangs the broad sunflower
  Over its grave i' the earth so chilly;
  Heavily hangs the hollyhock,
  Heavily hangs the tiger-lily.


2

  The air is damp, and hush'd, and close,
  As a sick man's room when he taketh repose
  An hour before death;
  My very heart faints and my whole soul grieves
  At the moist rich smell of the rotting leaves,
  And the breath
  Of the fading edges of box beneath,
  And the year's last rose.
  Heavily hangs the broad sunflower
  Over its grave i' the earth so chilly;
  Heavily hangs the hollyhock,
  Heavily hangs the tiger-lily.






ADELINE

First printed in 1830.


1

  Mystery of mysteries,
  Faintly smiling Adeline,
  Scarce of earth nor all divine,
  Nor unhappy, nor at rest,
  But beyond expression fair
  With thy floating flaxen hair;
  Thy rose-lips and full blue eyes
  Take the heart from out my breast.
  Wherefore those dim looks of thine,
  Shadowy, dreaming Adeline?


2

  Whence that aery bloom of thine,
  Like a lily which the sun
  Looks thro' in his sad decline,
  And a rose-bush leans upon,
  Thou that faintly smilest still,
  As a Naiad in a well,
  Looking at the set of day,
  Or a phantom two hours old
  Of a maiden passed away,
  Ere the placid lips be cold?
  Wherefore those faint smiles of thine,
  Spiritual Adeline?


3

  What hope or fear or joy is thine?
  Who talketh with thee, Adeline?
  For sure thou art not all alone:
  Do beating hearts of salient springs
  Keep measure with thine own?
  Hast thou heard the butterflies
  What they say betwixt their wings?
  Or in stillest evenings
  With what voice the violet woos
  To his heart the silver dews?
  Or when little airs arise,
  How the merry bluebell rings [1]
  To the mosses underneath?
  Hast thou look'd upon the breath
  Of the lilies at sunrise?
  Wherefore that faint smile of thine,
  Shadowy, dreaming Adeline?


4

  Some honey-converse feeds thy mind,
  Some spirit of a crimson rose
  In love with thee forgets to close
  His curtains, wasting odorous sighs
  All night long on darkness blind.
  What aileth thee? whom waitest thou
  With thy soften'd, shadow'd brow,
  And those dew-lit eyes of thine, [2]
  Thou faint smiler, Adeline?


5

  Lovest thou the doleful wind
  When thou gazest at the skies?
  Doth the low-tongued Orient [3]
  Wander from the side of [4] the morn,
  Dripping with Sabsean spice
  On thy pillow, lowly bent
  With melodious airs lovelorn,
  Breathing Light against thy face,
  While his locks a-dropping [5] twined
  Round thy neck in subtle ring
  Make a 'carcanet of rays',[6]
  And ye talk together still,
  In the language wherewith Spring
  Letters cowslips on the hill?
  Hence that look and smile of thine,
  Spiritual Adeline.


[Footnote 1: This conceit seems to have been borrowed from Shelley,
'Sensitive Plant', i.:--

  And the hyacinth, purple and white and blue,
  Which flung from its bells a sweet peal anew
  Of music.]

[Footnote 2: 'Cf'. Collins, 'Ode to Pity', "and 'eyes of dewy light'".]

[Footnote 3: What "the low-tongued Orient" may mean I cannot explain.]

[Footnote 4: 1830 and all editions till 1853. O'.]

[Footnote 5: 1863. A-drooping.]

[Footnote 6: A carcanet is a necklace, diminutive from old French
"Carcan". Cf. 'Comedy of Errors', in., i, "To see the making of her
'Carcanet".]





A CHARACTER

First printed in 1830.

The only authoritative light thrown on the person here described is what
the present Lord Tennyson gives, who tells us that "the then well-known
Cambridge orator S--was partly described". He was "a very plausible,
parliament-like, self-satisfied speaker at the Union Debating Society ".
The character reminds us of Wordsworth's Moralist. See 'Poet's Epitaph';--

  One to whose smooth-rubbed soul can cling,
  Nor form nor feeling, great nor small;
  A reasoning, self-sufficient thing,
  An intellectual all in all.

Shakespeare's fop, too (Hotspur's speech, 'Henry IV.', i., i., 2), seems
to have suggested a touch or two.


  With a half-glance upon the sky
  At night he said, "The wanderings
  Of this most intricate Universe
  Teach me the nothingness of things".
  Yet could not all creation pierce
  Beyond the bottom of his eye.

  He spake of beauty: that the dull
  Saw no divinity in grass,
  Life in dead stones, or spirit in air;
  Then looking as 'twere in a glass,
  He smooth'd his chin and sleek'd his hair,
  And said the earth was beautiful.

  He spake of virtue: not the gods
  More purely, when they wish to charm
  Pallas and Juno sitting by:
  And with a sweeping of the arm,
  And a lack-lustre dead-blue eye,
  Devolved his rounded periods.

  Most delicately hour by hour
  He canvass'd human mysteries,
  And trod on silk, as if the winds
  Blew his own praises in his eyes,
  And stood aloof from other minds
  In impotence of fancied power.

  With lips depress'd as he were meek,
  Himself unto himself he sold:
  Upon himself himself did feed:
  Quiet, dispassionate, and cold,
  And other than his form of creed,
  With chisell'd features clear and sleek.






THE POET

First printed in 1830.

In this poem we have the first grand note struck by Tennyson, the first
poem exhibiting the [Greek: spoudaiotaes] of the true poet.


  The poet in a golden clime was born,
  With golden stars above;
  Dower'd with the hate of hate, the scorn of scorn,[1]
  The love of love.

  He saw thro' [2] life and death, thro' [2] good and ill,
  He saw thro' [2] his own soul.
  The marvel of the everlasting will,
  An open scroll,

  Before him lay: with echoing feet he threaded
  The secretest walks of fame:
  The viewless arrows of his thoughts were headed
  And wing'd with flame,--

  Like Indian reeds blown from his silver tongue,
  And of so fierce a flight,
  From Calpe unto Caucasus they sung,
  Filling with light

  And vagrant melodies the winds which bore
  Them earthward till they lit;
  Then, like the arrow-seeds of the field flower,
  The fruitful wit

  Cleaving, took root, and springing forth anew
  Where'er they fell, behold,
  Like to the mother plant in semblance, grew
  A flower all gold,

  And bravely furnish'd all abroad to fling
  The winged shafts of truth,
  To throng with stately blooms the breathing spring
  Of Hope and Youth.

  So many minds did gird their orbs with beams,
  Tho' [3] one did fling the fire.
  Heaven flow'd upon the soul in many dreams
  Of high desire.

  Thus truth was multiplied on truth, the world
  Like one [4] great garden show'd,
  And thro' the wreaths of floating dark upcurl'd,
  Rare sunrise flow'd.

  And Freedom rear'd in that august sunrise
  Her beautiful bold brow,
  When rites and forms before his burning eyes
  Melted like snow.

  There was no blood upon her maiden robes
  Sunn'd by those orient skies;
  But round about the circles of the globes
  Of her keen eyes

  And in her raiment's hem was traced in flame
  WISDOM, a name to shake
  All evil dreams of power--a sacred name. [5]
  And when she spake,

  Her words did gather thunder as they ran,
  And as the lightning to the thunder
  Which follows it, riving the spirit of man,
  Making earth wonder,

  So was their meaning to her words.
  No sword
  Of wrath her right arm whirl'd, [6]
  But one poor poet's scroll, and with 'his' word
  She shook the world.


[Footnote 1: The expression, as is not uncommon with Tennyson, is
extremely ambiguous; it may mean that he hated hatred, scorned scorn,
and loved love, or that he had hatred, scorn and love as it were in
quintessence, like Dante, and that is no doubt the meaning.]

[Footnotes 2: 1830. Through.]

[Footnote 3: 1830 till 1851. Though.]

[Footnote 4: 2 1830. A.]

[Footnote 5: 1830.

  And in the bordure of her robe was writ
  Wisdom, a name to shake
  Hoar anarchies, as with a thunderfit.]

[Footnote 6: 1830. Hurled.]






THE POET'S MIND

First published in 1830.

A companion poem to the preceding. After line 7
in 1830 appears this stanza, afterwards omitted:--

  Clear as summer mountain streams,
  Bright as the inwoven beams,
  Which beneath their crisping sapphire
  In the midday, floating o'er
  The golden sands, make evermore
  To a blossom-starred shore.
  Hence away, unhallowed laughter!




1

  Vex not thou the poet's mind
  With thy shallow wit:
  Vex not thou the poet's mind;
  For thou canst not fathom it.
  Clear and bright it should be ever,
  Flowing like a crystal river;
  Bright as light, and clear as wind.


2

  Dark-brow'd sophist, come not anear;
  All the place [1] is holy ground;
  Hollow smile and frozen sneer
  Come not here.
  Holy water will I pour
  Into every spicy flower
  Of the laurel-shrubs that hedge it around.
  The flowers would faint at your cruel cheer.
  In your eye there is death,
  There is frost in your breath
  Which would blight the plants.
  Where you stand you cannot hear
  From the groves within
  The wild-bird's din.
  In the heart of the garden the merry bird chants,
  It would fall to the ground if you came in.
  In the middle leaps a fountain
  Like sheet lightning,
  Ever brightening
  With a low melodious thunder;
  All day and all night it is ever drawn
  From the brain of the purple mountain
  Which stands in the distance yonder:
  It springs on a level of bowery lawn,
  And the mountain draws it from Heaven above,
  And it sings a song of undying love;
  And yet, tho' [2] its voice be so clear and full,
  You never would hear it; your ears are so dull;
  So keep where you are: you are foul with sin;
  It would shrink to the earth if you came in.


[Footnote 1: 1830. The poet's mind. With this may be compared the
opening stanza of Gray's 'Installation Ode': "Hence! avaunt! 'tis holy
ground," and for the sentiments 'cf'. Wordsworth's 'Poet's Epitaph.'

[Footnote 2: 1830 to 1851. Though.]






THE SEA-FAIRIES

First published in 1830 but excluded from all editions till its
restoration, when it was greatly altered, in 1853. I here give the text
as it appeared in 1830; where the present text is the same as that of
1830 asterisks indicate it.

This poem is a sort of prelude to the Lotus-Eaters, the burthen being
the same, a siren song: "Why work, why toil, when all must be over so
soon, and when at best there is so little to reward?"


  Slow sailed the weary mariners, and saw
  Between the green brink and the running foam
  White limbs unrobed in a chrystal air,
  Sweet faces, etc.
  ...
                    middle sea.


                 SONG.

  Whither away, whither away, whither away?
  Fly no more!
  Whither away wi' the singing sail? whither away wi' the oar?
  Whither away from the high green field and the happy blossoming shore?
  Weary mariners, hither away,
  One and all, one and all,
  Weary mariners, come and play;
  We will sing to you all the day;
  Furl the sail and the foam will fall
  From the prow! one and all
  Furl the sail! drop the oar!
  Leap ashore!
  Know danger and trouble and toil no more.
  Whither away wi' the sail and the oar?
  Drop the oar,
  Leap ashore,
  Fly no more!
  Whither away wi' the sail? whither away wi' the oar?
  Day and night to the billow, etc.
  ...
                                    over the lea;
  They freshen the silvery-crimson shells,
  And thick with white bells the cloverhill swells
  High over the full-toned sea.
  Merrily carol the revelling gales
  Over the islands free:
  From the green seabanks the rose downtrails
  To the happy brimmed sea.
  Come hither, come hither, and be our lords,
  For merry brides are we:
  We will kiss sweet kisses, etc.
  ...
  With pleasure and love and revelry;
  ...
                                      ridged sea.
  Ye will not find so happy a shore
  Weary mariners! all the world o'er;
  Oh! fly no more!
  Harken ye, harken ye, sorrow shall darken ye,
  Danger and trouble and toil no more;
  Whither away?
  Drop the oar;
  Hither away,
  Leap ashore;
  Oh! fly no more--no more.
  Whither away, whither away, whither away with the sail and the oar?

  Slow sail'd the weary mariners and saw,
  Betwixt the green brink and the running foam,
  Sweet faces, rounded arms, and bosoms prest
  To little harps of gold; and while they mused,
  Whispering to each other half in fear,
  Shrill music reach'd them on the middle sea.

  Whither away, whither away, whither away? fly no more.
  Whither away from the high green field, and the happy blossoming shore?
  Day and night to the billow the fountain calls;
  Down shower the gambolling waterfalls
  From wandering over the lea:
  Out of the live-green heart of the dells
  They freshen the silvery-crimsoned shells,
  And thick with white bells the clover-hill swells
  High over the full-toned sea:
  O hither, come hither and furl your sails,
  Come hither to me and to me:
  Hither, come hither and frolic and play;
  Here it is only the mew that wails;
  We will sing to you all the day:
  Mariner, mariner, furl your sails,
  For here are the blissful downs and dales,
  And merrily merrily carol the gales,
  And the spangle dances in bight [1] and bay,
  And the rainbow forms and flies on the land
  Over the islands free;
  And the rainbow lives in the curve of the sand;
  Hither, come hither and see;
  And the rainbow hangs on the poising wave,
  And sweet is the colour of cove and cave,

  And sweet shall your welcome be:
  O hither, come hither, and be our lords
  For merry brides are we:
  We will kiss sweet kisses, and speak sweet words:
  O listen, listen, your eyes shall glisten
  With pleasure and love and jubilee:
  O listen, listen, your eyes shall glisten
  When the sharp clear twang of the golden cords
  Runs up the ridged sea.
  Who can light on as happy a shore
  All the world o'er, all the world o'er?
  Whither away? listen and stay: mariner, mariner, fly no more.


[Footnote 1: Bight is properly the coil of a rope; it then came to mean
a bend, and so a corner or bay. The same phrase occurs in the 'Voyage of
Maledune', v.: "and flung them in bight and bay".]






THE DESERTED HOUSE

First printed in 1830, omitted in all the editions till 1848 when it was
restored. The poem is of course allegorical, and is very much in the
vein of many poems in Anglo-Saxon poetry.


1

  Life and Thought have gone away
  Side by side,
  Leaving door and windows wide:
  Careless tenants they!


2

  All within is dark as night:
  In the windows is no light;
  And no murmur at the door,
  So frequent on its hinge before.


3

  Close the door, the shutters close,
  Or thro' [1] the windows we shall see
  The nakedness and vacancy
  Of the dark deserted house.


4

  Come away: no more of mirth
  Is here or merry-making sound.
  The house was builded of the earth,
  And shall fall again to ground.


5

  Come away: for Life and Thought
  Here no longer dwell;
  But in a city glorious--
  A great and distant city--have bought
  A mansion incorruptible.
  Would they could have stayed with us!


[Footnote 1: 1848 and 1851. Through.]






THE DYING SWAN

First printed in 1830.

The superstition here assumed is so familiar from the Classics as well
as from modern tradition that it scarcely needs illustration or
commentary. But see Plato, 'Phaedrus', xxxi., and Shakespeare, 'King
John', v., 7.


1

  The plain was grassy, wild and bare,
  Wide, wild, and open to the air,
  Which had built up everywhere
  An under-roof of doleful gray. [1]
  With an inner voice the river ran,
  Adown it floated a dying swan,
  And [2] loudly did lament.
  It was the middle of the day.
  Ever the weary wind went on,
  And took the reed-tops as it went.


2

  Some blue peaks in the distance rose,
  And white against the cold-white sky,
  Shone out their crowning snows.
  One willow over the water [3] wept,
  And shook the wave as the wind did sigh;
  Above in the wind was [4] the swallow,
  Chasing itself at its own wild will,
  And far thro' [5] the marish green and still
  The tangled water-courses slept,
  Shot over with purple, and green, and yellow.


3

  The wild swan's death-hymn took the soul
  Of that waste place with joy
  Hidden in sorrow: at first to the ear
  The warble was low, and full and clear;
  And floating about the under-sky,
  Prevailing in weakness, the coronach [6] stole
  Sometimes afar, and sometimes anear;
  But anon her awful jubilant voice,
  With a music strange and manifold,
  Flow'd forth on a carol free and bold;
  As when a mighty people rejoice
  With shawms, and with cymbals, and harps of gold,
  And the tumult of their acclaim is roll'd
  Thro' [7] the open gates of the city afar,
  To the shepherd who watcheth the evening star.
  And the creeping mosses and clambering weeds,
  And the willow-branches hoar and dank,
  And the wavy swell of the soughing reeds,
  And the wave-worn horns of the echoing bank,
  And the silvery marish-flowers that throng
  The desolate creeks and pools among,
  Were flooded over with eddying song.

  coronach' and shrieking".]

A DIRGE

First printed in 1830.


1

  Now is done thy long day's work;
  Fold thy palms across thy breast,
  Fold thine arms, turn to thy rest.
  Let them rave.
  Shadows of the silver birk [1]
  Sweep the green that folds thy grave.
  Let them rave.


2

  Thee nor carketh [2] care nor slander;
  Nothing but the small cold worm
  Fretteth thine enshrouded form.
  Let them rave.
  Light and shadow ever wander
  O'er the green that folds thy grave.
  Let them rave.


3

  Thou wilt not turn upon thy bed;
  Chaunteth not the brooding bee
  Sweeter tones than calumny?
  Let them rave.
  Thou wilt never raise thine head
  From the green that folds thy grave.
  Let them rave.


4

  Crocodiles wept tears for thee;
  The woodbine and eglatere
  Drip sweeter dews than traitor's tear.
  Let them rave.
  Rain makes music in the tree
  O'er the green that folds thy grave.
  Let them rave.


5

  Round thee blow, self-pleached [1] deep,
  Bramble-roses, faint and pale,
  And long purples [2] of the dale.
  Let them rave.
  These in every shower creep.
  Thro' [3] the green that folds thy grave.
  Let them rave.


6

  The gold-eyed kingcups fine:
  The frail bluebell peereth over
  Rare broidry of the purple clover.
  Let them rave.
  Kings have no such couch as thine,
  As the green that folds thy grave.
  Let them rave.


7

  Wild words wander here and there;
  God's great gift of speech abused
  Makes thy memory confused:
  But let them rave.
  The balm-cricket [4] carols clear
  In the green that folds thy grave.
  Let them rave.


[Footnote 1: Still used in the north of England for "birch".]

[Footnote 2: Carketh. Here used transitively, "troubles," though in Old
English it is generally intransitive, meaning to be careful or
thoughtful; it is from the Anglo-Saxon 'Carian'; it became obsolete in
the seventeenth century. The substantive cark, trouble or anxiety, is
generally in Old English coupled with "care".]

[Footnote 3: Self-pleached, self-entangled or intertwined. 'Cf'.
Shakespeare, "pleached bower," 'Much Ado', iii., i., 7.]

[Footnote 4: 1830. "'Long purples'," thus marking that the phrase is
borrowed from Shakespeare, 'Hamlet', iv., vii., 169:--

LOVE AND DEATH

First printed in 1830.

  What time the mighty moon was gathering light [1]
  Love paced the thymy plots of Paradise,
  And all about him roll'd his lustrous eyes;
  When, turning round a cassia, full in view
  Death, walking all alone beneath a yew,
  And talking to himself, first met his sight:
  "You must begone," said Death, "these walks are mine".
  Love wept and spread his sheeny vans [2] for flight;
  Yet ere he parted said, "This hour is thine;
  Thou art the shadow of life, and as the tree
  Stands in the sun and shadows all beneath,
  So in the light of great eternity
  Life eminent creates the shade of death;
  The shadow passeth when the tree shall fall,
  But I shall reign for ever over all". [3]


[Footnote 1: The expression is Virgil's, 'Georg'., i., 427: "Luna
revertentes cum primum 'colligit ignes'".]

[Footnote 2: Vans used also for "wings" by Milton, 'Paradise Lost', ii.,
927-8:--

  His sail-broad 'vans'
  He spreads for flight.

So also Tasso, 'Ger. Lib'., ix., 60:

  "Indi spiega al gran volo 'i vanni' aurati".]

[Footnote 3: 'Cf. Lockley Hall Sixty Years After': "Love will conquer at
the last".]






THE BALLAD OF ORIANA

First published in 1830, not in 1833.

This fine ballad was evidently suggested by the old ballad of Helen of
Kirkconnel, both poems being based on a similar incident, and both being
the passionate soliloquy of the bereaved lover, though Tennyson's
treatment of the subject is his own. Helen of Kirkconnel was one of the
poems which he was fond of reciting, and Fitzgerald says that he used
also to recite this poem, in a way not to be forgotten, at Cambridge
tables. 'Life', i., p. 77.

  My heart is wasted with my woe, Oriana.
  There is no rest for me below, Oriana.
  When the long dun wolds are ribb'd with snow,
  And loud the Norland whirlwinds blow, Oriana,
  Alone I wander to and fro, Oriana.

  Ere the light on dark was growing, Oriana,
  At midnight the cock was crowing, Oriana:
  Winds were blowing, waters flowing,
  We heard the steeds to battle going, Oriana;
  Aloud the hollow bugle blowing, Oriana.

  In the yew-wood black as night, Oriana,
  Ere I rode into the fight, Oriana,
  While blissful tears blinded my sight
  By star-shine and by moonlight, Oriana,
  I to thee my troth did plight, Oriana.

  She stood upon the castle wall, Oriana:
  She watch'd my crest among them all, Oriana:
  She saw me fight, she heard me call,
  When forth there stept a foeman tall, Oriana,
  Atween me and the castle wall, Oriana.

  The bitter arrow went aside, Oriana:
  The false, false arrow went aside, Oriana:
  The damned arrow glanced aside,
  And pierced thy heart, my love, my bride, Oriana!
  Thy heart, my life, my love, my bride, Oriana!

  Oh! narrow, narrow was the space, Oriana.
  Loud, loud rung out the bugle's brays, Oriana.
  Oh! deathful stabs were dealt apace,
  The battle deepen'd in its place, Oriana;
  But I was down upon my face, Oriana.

  They should have stabb'd me where I lay, Oriana!
  How could I rise and come away, Oriana?
  How could I look upon the day?
  They should have stabb'd me where I lay, Oriana
  They should have trod me into clay, Oriana.

  O breaking heart that will not break, Oriana!
  O pale, pale face so sweet and meek, Oriana!
  Thou smilest, but thou dost not speak,
  And then the tears run down my cheek, Oriana:
  What wantest thou? whom dost thou seek, Oriana?

  I cry aloud: none hear my cries, Oriana.
  Thou comest atween me and the skies, Oriana.
  I feel the tears of blood arise
  Up from my heart unto my eyes, Oriana.
  Within my heart my arrow lies, Oriana.

  O cursed hand! O cursed blow! Oriana!
  O happy thou that liest low, Oriana!
  All night the silence seems to flow
  Beside me in my utter woe, Oriana.
  A weary, weary way I go, Oriana.

  When Norland winds pipe down the sea, Oriana,
  I walk, I dare not think of thee, Oriana.
  Thou liest beneath the greenwood tree,
  I dare not die and come to thee, Oriana.
  I hear the roaring of the sea, Oriana.






CIRCUMSTANCE

First published in 1830.


  Two children in two neighbour villages
  Playing mad pranks along the healthy leas;
  Two strangers meeting at a festival;
  Two lovers whispering by an orchard wall;
  Two lives bound fast in one with golden ease;
  Two graves grass-green beside a gray church-tower,
  Wash'd with still rains and daisy-blossomed;
  Two children in one hamlet born and bred;
  So runs [1] the round of life from hour to hour.

THE MERMAN

First printed in 1830.


1

  Who would be
  A merman bold,
  Sitting alone,
  Singing alone
  Under the sea,
  With a crown of gold,
  On a throne?


2

  I would be a merman bold;
  I would sit and sing the whole of the day;
  I would fill the sea-halls with a voice of power;
  But at night I would roam abroad and play
  With the mermaids in and out of the rocks,
  Dressing their hair with the white sea-flower;
  And holding them back by their flowing locks
  I would kiss them often under the sea,
  And kiss them again till they kiss'd me
  Laughingly, laughingly;
  And then we would wander away, away
  To the pale-green sea-groves straight and high,
  Chasing each other merrily.


3

  There would be neither moon nor star;
  But the wave would make music above us afar--
  Low thunder and light in the magic night--
  Neither moon nor star.
  We would call aloud in the dreamy dells,
  Call to each other and whoop and cry
  All night, merrily, merrily;
  They would pelt me with starry spangles and shells,
  Laughing and clapping their hands between,
  All night, merrily, merrily:
  But I would throw to them back in mine
  Turkis and agate and almondine: [1]
  Then leaping out upon them unseen
  I would kiss them often under the sea,
  And kiss them again till they kiss'd me
  Laughingly, laughingly.
  Oh! what a happy life were mine
  Under the hollow-hung ocean green!
  Soft are the moss-beds under the sea;
  We would live merrily, merrily.


[Foootnote 1: Almondine. This should be "almandine," the word probably
being a corruption of alabandina, a gem so called because found at
Alabanda in Caria; it is a garnet of a violet or amethystine tint. 'Cf.'
Browning, 'Fefine at the Fair', xv., "that string of mock-turquoise,
these 'almandines' of glass".]






THE MERMAID

First printed in 1830.


1

  Who would be
  A mermaid fair,
  Singing alone,
  Combing her hair
  Under the sea,
  In a golden curl
  With a comb of pearl,
  On a throne?


2

  I would be a mermaid fair;
  I would sing to myself the whole of the day;
  With a comb of pearl I would comb my hair;
  And still as I comb'd I would sing and say,
  "Who is it loves me? who loves not me?"
  I would comb my hair till my ringlets would fall,
  Low adown, low adown,
  From under my starry sea-bud crown
  Low adown and around,
  And I should look like a fountain of gold
  Springing alone
  With a shrill inner sound,
  Over the throne
  In the midst of the hall;
  Till that [1] great sea-snake under the sea
  From his coiled sleeps in the central deeps
  Would slowly trail himself sevenfold
  Round the hall where I sate, and look in at the gate
  With his large calm eyes for the love of me.
  And all the mermen under the sea
  Would feel their [2] immortality
  Die in their hearts for the love of me.


3

  But at night I would wander away, away,
  I would fling on each side my low-flowing locks,
  And lightly vault from the throne and play
  With the mermen in and out of the rocks;
  We would run to and fro, and hide and seek,
  On the broad sea-wolds in the [1] crimson shells,
  Whose silvery spikes are nighest the sea.
  But if any came near I would call, and shriek,
  And adown the steep like a wave I would leap
  From the diamond-ledges that jut from the dells;
  For I would not be kiss'd [2] by all who would list,
  Of the bold merry mermen under the sea;
  They would sue me, and woo me, and flatter me,
  In the purple twilights under the sea;
  But the king of them all would carry me,
  Woo me, and win me, and marry me,
  In the branching jaspers under the sea;
  Then all the dry pied things that be
  In the hueless mosses under the sea
  Would curl round my silver feet silently,
  All looking up for the love of me.
  And if I should carol aloud, from aloft
  All things that are forked, and horned, and soft
  Would lean out from the hollow sphere of the sea,
  All looking down for the love of me.

SONNET TO J. M. K.

First printed in 1830, not in 1833.

This sonnet was addressed to John Mitchell Kemble, the well-known Editor
of the 'Beowulf' and other Anglo-Saxon poems. He intended to go into the
Church, but was never ordained, and devoted his life to early English
studies. See memoir of him in 'Dict, of Nat. Biography'.


  My hope and heart is with thee--thou wilt be
  A latter Luther, and a soldier-priest
  To scare church-harpies from the master's feast;
  Our dusted velvets have much need of thee:
  Thou art no Sabbath-drawler of old saws,
  Distill'd from some worm-canker'd homily;
  But spurr'd at heart with fieriest energy
  To embattail and to wall about thy cause
  With iron-worded proof, hating to hark
  The humming of the drowsy pulpit-drone
  Half God's good sabbath, while the worn-out clerk
  Brow-beats his desk below. Thou from a throne
  Mounted in heaven wilt shoot into the dark
  Arrows of lightnings. I will stand and mark.




THE LADY OF SHALOTT

First published in 1833.

This poem was composed in its first form as early as May, 1832 or 1833,
as we learn from Fitzgerald's note--of the exact year he was not certain
('Life of Tennyson', i., 147). The evolution of the poem is an
interesting study. How greatly it was altered in the second edition of
1842 will be evident from the collation which follows. The text of 1842
became the permanent text, and in this no subsequent material
alterations were made. The poem is more purely fanciful than Tennyson
perhaps was willing to own; certainly his explanation of the allegory,
as he gave it to Canon Ainger, is not very intelligible: "The new-born
love for something, for some one in the wide world from which she has
been so long excluded, takes her out of the region of shadows into that
of realities". Poe's commentary is most to the point: "Why do some
persons fatigue themselves in endeavours to unravel such phantasy pieces
as the 'Lady of Shallot'? As well unweave the ventum
textilem".--'Democratic Review', Dec., 1844, quoted by Mr. Herne
Shepherd. Mr. Palgrave says (selection from the 'Lyric Poems of
Tennyson', p. 257) the poem was suggested by an Italian romance upon the
Donna di Scalotta. On what authority this is said I do not know, nor can
I identify the novel. In Novella, lxxxi., a collection of novels printed
at Milan in 1804, there is one which tells but very briefly the story of
Elaine's love and death, "Qui conta come la Damigella di scalot mori per
amore di Lancealotto di Lac," and as in this novel Camelot is placed
near the sea, this may be the novel referred to. In any case the poem is
a fanciful and possibly an allegorical variant of the story of Elaine,
Shalott being a form, through the French, of Astolat.


PART I

  On either side the river lie
  Long fields of barley and of rye,
  That clothe the wold and meet the sky;
  And thro' the field the road runs by
  To many-tower'd Camelot;
  And up and down the people go,
  Gazing where the lilies blow
  Round an island there below,
  The island of Shalott. [1]

  Willows whiten, aspens quiver, [2]
  Little breezes dusk and shiver
  Thro' the wave that runs for ever
  By the island in the river
  Flowing down to Camelot.
  Four gray walls, and four gray towers,
  Overlook a space of flowers,
  And the silent isle imbowers
  The Lady of Shalott.

  By the margin, willow-veil'd
  Slide the heavy barges trail'd
  By slow horses; and unhail'd
  The shallop flitteth silken-sail'd
  Skimming down to Camelot:
  But who hath seen her wave her hand?
  Or at the casement seen her stand?
  Or is she known in all the land,
  The Lady of Shalott? [3]

  Only reapers, reaping early
  In among the bearded barley,
  Hear a song that echoes cheerly
  From the river winding clearly,
  Down to tower'd Camelot:
  And by the moon the reaper weary,
  Piling sheaves in uplands airy,
  Listening, whispers "'Tis the fairy
  Lady of Shalott". [4]


PART II

  There she weaves by night and day
  A magic web with colours gay.
  She has heard a whisper say,
  A curse is on her if she stay [5]
  To look down to Camelot.
  She knows not what the 'curse' may be,
  And so [6] she weaveth steadily,
  And little other care hath she,
  The Lady of Shalott.

  And moving thro' a mirror clear
  That hangs before her all the year,
  Shadows of the world appear.
  There she sees the highway near
  Winding down to Camelot:
  There the river eddy whirls,
  And there the surly village-churls, [7]
  And the red cloaks of market girls,
  Pass onward from Shalott.

  Sometimes a troop of damsels glad,
  An abbot on an ambling pad,
  Sometimes a curly shepherd-lad,
  Or long-hair'd page in crimson clad,
  Goes by to tower'd Camelot;

  And sometimes thro' the mirror blue
  The knights come riding two and two:
  She hath no loyal knight and true,
  The Lady of Shalott.

  But in her web she still delights
  To weave the mirror's magic sights,
  For often thro' the silent nights
  A funeral, with plumes and lights,
  And music, went to Camelot: [8]
  Or when the moon was overhead,
  Came two young lovers lately wed;
  "I am half-sick of shadows," said
  The Lady of Shalott. [9]



PART III

  A bow-shot from her bower-eaves,
  He rode between the barley sheaves,
  The sun came dazzling thro' the leaves,
  And flamed upon the brazen greaves
  Of bold Sir Lancelot.
  A redcross knight for ever kneel'd
  To a lady in his shield,
  That sparkled on the yellow field,
  Beside remote Shalott.

  The gemmy bridle glitter'd free,
  Like to some branch of stars we see
  Hung in the golden Galaxy. [10]
  The bridle bells rang merrily
  As he rode down to [11] Camelot:
  And from his blazon'd baldric slung
  A mighty silver bugle hung,
  And as he rode his armour rung,
  Beside remote Shalott.

  All in the blue unclouded weather
  Thick-jewell'd shone the saddle-leather,
  The helmet and the helmet-feather
  Burn'd like one burning flame together,
  As he rode down to Camelot. [12]
  As often thro' the purple night,
  Below the starry clusters bright,
  Some bearded meteor, trailing light,
  Moves over still Shalott. [13]

  His broad clear brow in sunlight glow'd;
  On burnish'd hooves his war-horse trode;
  From underneath his helmet flow'd
  His coal-black curls as on he rode,
  As he rode down to Camelot. [14]
  From the bank and from the river
  He flashed into the crystal mirror,
  "Tirra lirra," by the river [15]
  Sang Sir Lancelot.

  She left the web, she left the loom;
  She made three paces thro' the room,
  She saw the water-lily [16] bloom,
  She saw the helmet and the plume,
  She look'd down to Camelot.
  Out flew the web and floated wide;
  The mirror crack'd from side to side;
  "The curse is come upon me," cried
  The Lady of Shalott.


PART IV

  In the stormy east-wind straining,
  The pale yellow woods were waning,
  The broad stream in his banks complaining,
  Heavily the low sky raining
  Over tower'd Camelot;
  Down she came and found a boat
  Beneath a willow left afloat,
  And round about the prow she wrote
  'The Lady of Shalott.' [17]

  And down the river's dim expanse--
  Like some bold seer in a trance,
  Seeing all his own mischance--
  With a glassy countenance
  Did she look to Camelot.
  And at the closing of the day
  She loosed the chain, and down she lay;
  The broad stream bore her far away,
  The Lady of Shalott.

  Lying, robed in snowy white
  That loosely flew to left and right--
  The leaves upon her falling light--
  Thro' the noises of the night
  She floated down to Camelot;
  And as the boat-head wound along
  The willowy hills and fields among,
  They heard her singing her last song,
  The Lady of Shalott. [18]

  Heard a carol, mournful, holy,
  Chanted loudly, chanted lowly,
  Till her blood was frozen slowly,
  And her eyes were darken'd wholly, [19]
  Turn'd to tower'd Camelot;
  For ere she reach'd upon the tide
  The first house by the water-side,
  Singing in her song she died,
  The Lady of Shalott.

  Under tower and balcony,
  By garden-wall and gallery,
  A gleaming shape she floated by,
  Dead-pale [20] between the houses high,
  Silent into Camelot.
  Out upon the wharfs they came,
  Knight and burgher, lord and dame,
  And round the prow they read her name,
  'The Lady of Shalott' [21]

  Who is this? and what is here?
  And in the lighted palace near
  Died the sound of royal cheer;
  And they cross'd themselves for fear,
  All the knights at Camelot:
  But Lancelot [22] mused a little space;
  He said, "She has a lovely face;
  God in his mercy lend her grace,
  The Lady of Shalott". [23]




[Footnote 1: 1833.

  To many towered Camelot
  The yellow leaved water lily,
  The green sheathed daffodilly,
  Tremble in the water chilly,
  Round about Shalott.]


[Footnote 2: 1833.

  shiver,
  The sunbeam-showers break and quiver
  In the stream that runneth ever
  By the island, etc.]


[Footnote 3: 1833.

  Underneath the bearded barley,
  The reaper, reaping late and early,
  Hears her ever chanting cheerly,
  Like an angel, singing clearly,
  O'er the stream of Camelot.
  Piling the sheaves in furrows airy,
  Beneath the moon, the reaper weary
  Listening whispers, "'tis the fairy
  Lady of Shalott".]


[Footnote 4: 1833.

  The little isle is all inrailed
  With a rose-fence, and overtrailed
  With roses: by the marge unhailed
  The shallop flitteth silkensailed,
  Skimming down to Camelot.
  A pearl garland winds her head:
  She leaneth on a velvet bed,
  Full royally apparelled,
  The Lady of Shalott.]


[Footnote 5: 1833.

  No time hath she to sport and play:
  A charmed web she weaves alway.
  A curse is on her, if she stay
  Her weaving, either night or day]


[Footnote 6: 1833.

  Therefore
  ...
  Therefore
  ...
  The Lady of Shalott.]


[Footnote 7: 1833.

  She lives with little joy or fear
  Over the water running near,
  The sheep bell tinkles in her ear,
  Before her hangs a mirror clear,
  Reflecting towered Camelot.
  And, as the mazy web she whirls,
  She sees the surly village-churls.]


[Footnote 8: 1833. Came from Camelot.]

[Footnote 9: In these lines are to be found, says the present Lord
Tennyson, the key to the mystic symbolism of the poem. But it is not
easy to see how death could be an advantageous exchange for
fancy-haunted solitude. The allegory is clearer in lines 114-115, for
love will so break up mere phantasy.]

[Footnote 17: 1833.

  Outside the isle a shallow boat
  Beneath a willow lay afloat,
  Below the carven stern she wrote,
  THE LADY OF SHALOTT.]


[Footnote 18: 1833.

  A cloud-white crown of pearl she dight,
  All raimented in snowy white
  That loosely flew (her zone in sight,
  Clasped with one blinding diamond bright),
  Her wide eyes fixed on Camelot,
  Though the squally eastwind keenly
  Blew, with folded arms serenely
  By the water stood the queenly
  Lady of Shalott.

  With a steady, stony glance--
  Like some bold seer in a trance,
  Beholding all his own mischance,
  Mute, with a glassy countenance--
  She looked down to Camelot.
  It was the closing of the day,
  She loosed the chain, and down she lay,
  The broad stream bore her far away,
  The Lady of Shalott.

  As when to sailors while they roam,
  By creeks and outfalls far from home,
  Rising and dropping with the foam,
  From dying swans wild warblings come,
  Blown shoreward; so to Camelot
  Still as the boat-head wound along
  The willowy hills and fields among,
  They heard her chanting her death song,
  The Lady of Shalott.]


[Footnote 19: 1833.

  A long drawn carol, mournful, holy,
  She chanted loudly, chanted lowly,
  Till her eyes were darkened wholly,
  And her smooth face sharpened slowly.]


[Footnote 20: "A corse" (1853) is a variant for the "Dead-pale" of 1857.]

[Footnote 21: 1833.

  A pale, pale corpse she floated by,
  Dead cold, between the houses high,
  Dead into towered Camelot.
  Knight and burgher, lord and dame,
  To the planked wharfage came:
  Below the stern they read her name,
  "The Lady of Shalott".]


[Footnote 22: 1833. Spells it "Launcelot" all through.]

[Footnote 23: 1833.

  They crossed themselves, their stars they blest,
  Knight, minstrel, abbot, squire and guest,
  There lay a parchment on her breast,
  That puzzled more than all the rest,
  The well-fed wits at Camelot.
  "'The web was woven curiously,
  The charm is broken utterly,
  Draw near and fear not--this is I,
  The Lady of Shalott.'"]







MARIANA IN THE SOUTH

First printed in 1833.

This poem had been written as early as 1831 (see Arthur Hallam's letter,
'Life', i., 284-5, Appendix), and Lord Tennyson tells us that it
"came to my father as he was travelling between Narbonne and Perpignan";
how vividly the characteristic features of Southern France are depicted
must be obvious to every one who is familiar with them. It is
interesting to compare it with the companion poem; the central position
is the same in both, desolate loneliness, and the mood is the same, but
the setting is far more picturesque and is therefore more dwelt upon.
The poem was very greatly altered when re-published in 1842, that text
being practically the final one, there being no important variants
afterwards.

In the edition of 1833 the poem opened with the following stanza, which
was afterwards excised and the stanza of the present text substituted.


  Behind the barren hill upsprung
  With pointed rocks against the light,
  The crag sharpshadowed overhung
  Each glaring creek and inlet bright.
  Far, far, one light blue ridge was seen,
  Looming like baseless fairyland;
  Eastward a slip of burning sand,
  Dark-rimmed with sea, and bare of green,
  Down in the dry salt-marshes stood
  That house dark latticed. Not a breath
  Swayed the sick vineyard underneath,
  Or moved the dusty southernwood.
  "Madonna," with melodious moan
  Sang Mariana, night and morn,
  "Madonna! lo! I am all alone,
  Love-forgotten and love-forlorn."

  With one black shadow at its feet,
  The house thro' all the level shines,
  Close-latticed to the brooding heat,
  And silent in its dusty vines:
  A faint-blue ridge upon the right,
  An empty river-bed before,
  And shallows on a distant shore,
  In glaring sand and inlets bright.
  But "Ave Mary," made she moan,
  And "Ave Mary," night and morn,
  And "Ah," she sang, "to be all alone,
  To live forgotten, and love forlorn".

  She, as her carol sadder grew,
  From brow and bosom slowly down [1]
  Thro' rosy taper fingers drew
  Her streaming curls of deepest brown
  To left and right, [2] and made appear,
  Still-lighted in a secret shrine,
  Her melancholy eyes divine, [3]
  The home of woe without a tear.
  And "Ave Mary," was her moan, [4]
  "Madonna, sad is night and morn";
  And "Ah," she sang, "to be all alone,
  To live forgotten, and love forlorn".

  Till all the crimson changed, [5] and past
  Into deep orange o'er the sea,
  Low on her knees herself she cast,
  Before Our Lady murmur'd she;
  Complaining, "Mother, give me grace
  To help me of my weary load".
  And on the liquid mirror glow'd
  The clear perfection of her face.
  "Is this the form," she made her moan,
  "That won his praises night and morn?"
  And "Ah," she said, "but I wake alone,
  I sleep forgotten, I wake forlorn". [6]

  Nor bird would sing, nor lamb would bleat,
  Nor any cloud would cross the vault,
  But day increased from heat to heat,
  On stony drought and steaming salt;
  Till now at noon she slept again,
  And seem'd knee-deep in mountain grass,
  And heard her native breezes pass,
  And runlets babbling down the glen.
  She breathed in sleep a lower moan,
  And murmuring, as at night and morn,
  She thought, "My spirit is here alone,
  Walks forgotten, and is forlorn". [7]

  Dreaming, she knew it was a dream:
  She felt he was and was not there, [8]
  She woke: the babble of the stream
  Fell, and without the steady glare
  Shrank one sick willow [9] sere and small.
  The river-bed was dusty-white;
  And all the furnace of the light
  Struck up against the blinding wall. [10]
  She whisper'd, with a stifled moan
  More inward than at night or morn,
  "Sweet Mother, let me not here alone
  Live forgotten, and die forlorn". [11]

  [12] And rising, from her bosom drew
  Old letters, breathing of her worth,
  For "Love," they said, "must needs be true,
  To what is loveliest upon earth".
  An image seem'd to pass the door,
  To look at her with slight, and say,
  "But now thy beauty flows away,
  So be alone for evermore".
  "O cruel heart," she changed her tone,
  "And cruel love, whose end is scorn,
  Is this the end to be left alone,
  To live forgotten, and die forlorn!"

  But sometimes in the falling day
  An image seem'd to pass the door,
  To look into her eyes and say,
  "But thou shalt be alone no more".
  And flaming downward over all
  From heat to heat the day decreased,
  And slowly rounded to the east
  The one black shadow from the wall.
  "The day to night," she made her moan,
  "The day to night, the night to morn,
  And day and night I am left alone
  To live forgotten, and love forlorn."

  At eve a dry cicala sung,
  There came a sound as of the sea;
  Backward the lattice-blind she flung,
  And lean'd upon the balcony.
  There all in spaces rosy-bright
  Large Hesper glitter'd on her tears,
  And deepening thro' the silent spheres,
  Heaven over Heaven rose the night.
  And weeping then she made her moan,
  "The night comes on that knows not morn,
  When I shall cease to be all alone,
  To live forgotten, and love forlorn". [13]



[Footnote 1: 1833 From her warm brow and bosom down.]

[Footnote 2: 1833. On either side.]

[Footnote 3: Compare Keats, 'Eve of St. Agnes', "her maiden eyes
divine".]

[Footnote 4: 1833. "Madonna," with melodious moan Sang Mariana, etc.]

[Footnote 5: 1833. When the dawncrimson changed.]

[Footnote 6: 1833.

  Unto our Lady prayed she.
  She moved her lips, she prayed alone,
  She praying disarrayed and warm
  From slumber, deep her wavy form
  In the dark-lustrous mirror shone.
  "Madonna," in a low clear tone
  Said Mariana, night and morn,
  Low she mourned, "I am all alone,
  Love-forgotten, and love-forlorn".]


[Footnote 7: 1833.

  At noon she slumbered. All along
  The silvery field, the large leaves talked
  With one another, as among
  The spiked maize in dreams she walked.
  The lizard leapt: the sunlight played:
  She heard the callow nestling lisp,
  And brimful meadow-runnels crisp.
  In the full-leaved platan-shade.
  In sleep she breathed in a lower tone,
  Murmuring as at night and morn,
  "Madonna! lo! I am all alone.
  Love-forgotten and love-forlorn".]


[Footnote 8: 1835. Most false: he was and was not there.]

[Footnote 9: 1833. The sick olive. So the text remained till 1850, when
"one" was substituted.]

[Footnote 10: 1833.

  From the bald rock the blinding light
  Beat ever on the sunwhite wall.]


[Footnote 11: 1833.

  "Madonna, leave me not all alone,
  To die forgotten and live forlorn."]


[Footnote 12: This stanza and the next not in 1833.]

[Footnote 13: 1833.

  One dry cicala's summer song
  At night filled all the gallery.
  Ever the low wave seemed to roll
  Up to the coast: far on, alone
  In the East, large Hesper overshone
  The mourning gulf, and on her soul
  Poured divine solace, or the rise
  Of moonlight from the margin gleamed,
  Volcano-like, afar, and streamed
  On her white arm, and heavenward eyes.
  Not all alone she made her moan,
  Yet ever sang she, night and morn,
  "Madonna! lo! I am all alone,
  Love-forgotten and love-forlorn".]






ELEANORE

First printed in 1833. When reprinted in 1842 the alterations noted were
then made, and after that the text remained unchanged.


1

  Thy dark eyes open'd not,
  Nor first reveal'd themselves to English air,
  For there is nothing here,
  Which, from the outward to the inward brought,
  Moulded thy baby thought.
  Far off from human neighbourhood,
  Thou wert born, on a summer morn,
  A mile beneath the cedar-wood.
  Thy bounteous forehead was not fann'd
  With breezes from our oaken glades,
  But thou wert nursed in some delicious land
  Of lavish lights, and floating shades:
  And flattering thy childish thought
  The oriental fairy brought,
  At the moment of thy birth,
  From old well-heads of haunted rills,
  And the hearts of purple hills,
  And shadow'd coves on a sunny shore,
  The choicest wealth of all the earth,
  Jewel or shell, or starry ore,
  To deck thy cradle, Eleanore. [1]


2

  Or the yellow-banded bees, [2]
  Thro' [3] half-open lattices
  Coming in the scented breeze,
  Fed thee, a child, lying alone,
  With whitest honey in fairy gardens cull'd--
  A glorious child, dreaming alone,
  In silk-soft folds, upon yielding down,
  With the hum of swarming bees
  Into dreamful slumber lull'd.


3

  Who may minister to thee?
  Summer herself should minister
  To thee, with fruitage golden-rinded
  On golden salvers, or it may be,
  Youngest Autumn, in a bower
  Grape-thicken'd from the light, and blinded
  With many a deep-hued bell-like flower
  Of fragrant trailers, when the air
  Sleepeth over all the heaven,
  And the crag that fronts the Even,
  All along the shadowing shore,
  Crimsons over an inland [4] mere,
  [5] Eleanore!


4

  How may full-sail'd verse express,
  How may measured words adore
  The full-flowing harmony
  Of thy swan-like stateliness,
  Eleanore?
  The luxuriant symmetry
  Of thy floating gracefulness,
  Eleanore?
  Every turn and glance of thine,
  Every lineament divine,
  Eleanore,
  And the steady sunset glow,
  That stays upon thee? For in thee
  Is nothing sudden, nothing single;
  Like two streams of incense free
  From one censer, in one shrine,
  Thought and motion mingle,
  Mingle ever. Motions flow
  To one another, even as tho' [6]
  They were modulated so
  To an unheard melody,
  Which lives about thee, and a sweep
  Of richest pauses, evermore
  Drawn from each other mellow-deep;
  Who may express thee, Eleanore?


5

  I stand before thee, Eleanore;
  I see thy beauty gradually unfold,
  Daily and hourly, more and more.
  I muse, as in a trance, the while
  Slowly, as from a cloud of gold,
  Comes out thy deep ambrosial smile. [7]
  I muse, as in a trance, whene'er
  The languors of thy love-deep eyes
  Float on to me. _I_ would _I_ were
  So tranced, so rapt in ecstacies,
  To stand apart, and to adore,
  Gazing on thee for evermore,
  Serene, imperial Eleanore!


6

  Sometimes, with most intensity
  Gazing, I seem to see
  Thought folded over thought, smiling asleep,
  Slowly awaken'd, grow so full and deep
  In thy large eyes, that, overpower'd quite,
  I cannot veil, or droop my sight,
  But am as nothing in its light:
  As tho' [8] a star, in inmost heaven set,
  Ev'n while we gaze on it,
  Should slowly round his orb, and slowly grow
  To a full face, there like a sun remain
  Fix'd--then as slowly fade again,
  And draw itself to what it was before;
  So full, so deep, so slow,
  Thought seems to come and go
  In thy large eyes, imperial Eleanore.


7

  As thunder-clouds that, hung on high,
  Roof'd the world with doubt and fear, [9]
  Floating thro' an evening atmosphere,
  Grow golden all about the sky;
  In thee all passion becomes passionless,
  Touch'd by thy spirit's mellowness,
  Losing his fire and active might
  In a silent meditation,
  Falling into a still delight,
  And luxury of contemplation:
  As waves that up a quiet cove
  Rolling slide, and lying still
  Shadow forth the banks at will: [10]
  Or sometimes they swell and move,
  Pressing up against the land,
  With motions of the outer sea:
  And the self-same influence
  Controlleth all the soul and sense
  Of Passion gazing upon thee.
  His bow-string slacken'd, languid Love,
  Leaning his cheek upon his hand, [11]
  Droops both his wings, regarding thee,
  And so would languish evermore,
  Serene, imperial Eleanore.


8

  But when I see thee roam, with tresses unconfined,
  While the amorous, odorous wind
  Breathes low between the sunset and the moon;
  Or, in a shadowy saloon,
  On silken cushions half reclined;
  I watch thy grace; and in its place
  My heart a charmed slumber keeps, [12]
  While I muse upon thy face;
  And a languid fire creeps
  Thro' my veins to all my frame,
  Dissolvingly and slowly: soon
  From thy rose-red lips MY name
  Floweth; and then, as in a swoon, [13]
  With dinning sound my ears are rife,
  My tremulous tongue faltereth,
  I lose my colour, I lose my breath,
  I drink the cup of a costly death,
  Brimm'd with delirious draughts of warmest life.
  I die with my delight, before
  I hear what I would hear from thee;
  Yet tell my name again to me,
  I _would_ [14] be dying evermore,
  So dying ever, Eleanore.

description which Ibycus gives of Euryalus. See Bergk's 'Anthologia
Lyrica' (Ibycus), p. 396.]

  I gaze on thee the cloudless noon
  Of mortal beauty.]


[Footnote 13: 1833. Then I faint, I swoon. The latter part of the eighth
stanza is little more than an adaptation of Sappho's famous Ode,
filtered perhaps through the version of Catullus.]

have retained to the last the italics.]




THE MILLER'S DAUGHTER


First published in 1833. It was greatly altered when republished in
1842, and in some respects, so Fitzgerald thought, not for the better.
No alterations of much importance were made in it after 1842. The
characters as well as the scenery were, it seems, purely imaginary.
Tennyson said that if he thought of any mill it was that of Trumpington,
near Cambridge, which bears a general resemblance to the picture here
given.

In the first edition the poem opened with the following stanza, which
the 'Quarterly' ridiculed, and which was afterwards excised. Its
omission is surely not to be regretted, whatever Fitzgerald may have
thought.

  I met in all the close green ways,
  While walking with my line and rod,
  The wealthy miller's mealy face,
  Like the moon in an ivy-tod.
  He looked so jolly and so good--
  While fishing in the milldam-water,
  I laughed to see him as he stood,
  And dreamt not of the miller's daughter.

  *       *       *       *       *      *


  I see the wealthy miller yet,
  His double chin, his portly size,
  And who that knew him could forget
  The busy wrinkles round his eyes?
  The slow wise smile that, round about
  His dusty forehead drily curl'd,
  Seem'd half-within and half-without,
  And full of dealings with the world?

  In yonder chair I see him sit,
  Three fingers round the old silver cup--
  I see his gray eyes twinkle yet
  At his own jest--gray eyes lit up
  With summer lightnings of a soul
  So full of summer warmth, so glad,
  So healthy, sound, and clear and whole,
  His memory scarce can make me [1] sad.

  Yet fill my glass: give me one kiss:
  My own sweet [2] Alice, we must die.
  There's somewhat in this world amiss
  Shall be unriddled by and by.
  There's somewhat flows to us in life,
  But more is taken quite away.
  Pray, Alice, pray, my darling wife, [3]
  That we may die the self-same day.

  Have I not found a happy earth?
  I least should breathe a thought of pain.
  Would God renew me from my birth
  I'd almost live my life again.
  So sweet it seems with thee to walk,
  And once again to woo thee mine--
  It seems in after-dinner talk
  Across the walnuts and the wine--[4]

  To be the long and listless boy
  Late-left an orphan of the squire,
  Where this old mansion mounted high
  Looks down upon the village spire: [5]
  For even here, [6] where I and you
  Have lived and loved alone so long,
  Each morn my sleep was broken thro'
  By some wild skylark's matin song.

  And oft I heard the tender dove
  In firry woodlands making moan; [7]
  But ere I saw your eyes, my love,
  I had no motion of my own.
  For scarce my life with fancy play'd
  Before I dream'd that pleasant dream--
  Still hither thither idly sway'd
  Like those long mosses [8] in the stream.

  Or from the bridge I lean'd to hear
  The milldam rushing down with noise,
  And see the minnows everywhere
  In crystal eddies glance and poise,
  The tall flag-flowers when [9] they sprung
  Below the range of stepping-stones,
  Or those three chestnuts near, that hung
  In masses thick with milky cones. [10]

  But, Alice, what an hour was that,
  When after roving in the woods
  ('Twas April then), I came and sat
  Below the chestnuts, when their buds
  Were glistening to the breezy blue;
  And on the slope, an absent fool,
  I cast me down, nor thought of you,
  But angled in the higher pool. [11]

  A love-song I had somewhere read,
  An echo from a measured strain,
  Beat time to nothing in my head
  From some odd corner of the brain.
  It haunted me, the morning long,
  With weary sameness in the rhymes,
  The phantom of a silent song,
  That went and came a thousand times.

  Then leapt a trout. In lazy mood
  I watch'd the little circles die;
  They past into the level flood,
  And there a vision caught my eye;
  The reflex of a beauteous form,
  A glowing arm, a gleaming neck,
  As when a sunbeam wavers warm
  Within the dark and dimpled beck. [12]

  For you remember, you had set,
  That morning, on the casement's edge [13]
  A long green box of mignonette,
  And you were leaning from the ledge:
  And when I raised my eyes, above
  They met with two so full and bright--
  Such eyes! I swear to you, my love,
  That these have never lost their light. [14]

  I loved, and love dispell'd the fear
  That I should die an early death:
  For love possess'd the atmosphere,
  And filled the breast with purer breath.
  My mother thought, What ails the boy?
  For I was alter'd, and began
  To move about the house with joy,
  And with the certain step of man.

  I loved the brimming wave that swam
  Thro' quiet meadows round the mill,
  The sleepy pool above the dam,
  The pool beneath it never still,
  The meal-sacks on the whiten'd floor,
  The dark round of the dripping wheel,
  The very air about the door
  Made misty with the floating meal.

  And oft in ramblings on the wold,
  When April nights begin to blow,
  And April's crescent glimmer'd cold,
  I saw the village lights below;
  I knew your taper far away,
  And full at heart of trembling hope,
  From off the wold I came, and lay
  Upon the freshly-flower'd slope. [15]

  The deep brook groan'd beneath the mill;
  And "by that lamp," I thought "she sits!"
  The white chalk-quarry [16] from the hill
  Gleam'd to the flying moon by fits.
  "O that I were beside her now!
  O will she answer if I call?
  O would she give me vow for vow,
  Sweet Alice, if I told her all?" [17]

  Sometimes I saw you sit and spin;
  And, in the pauses of the wind,
  Sometimes I heard you sing within;
  Sometimes your shadow cross'd the blind.
  At last you rose and moved the light,
  And the long shadow of the chair
  Flitted across into the night,
  And all the casement darken'd there.

  But when at last I dared to speak,
  The lanes, you know, were white with may,
  Your ripe lips moved not, but your cheek
  Flush'd like the coming of the day; [18]
  And so it was--half-sly, half-shy, [19]
  You would, and would not, little one!
  Although I pleaded tenderly,
  And you and I were all alone.

  And slowly was my mother brought
  To yield consent to my desire:
  She wish'd me happy, but she thought
  I might have look'd a little higher;
  And I was young--too young to wed:
  "Yet must I love her for your sake;
  Go fetch your Alice here," she said:
  Her eyelid quiver'd as she spake.

  And down I went to fetch my bride:
  But, Alice, you were ill at ease;
  This dress and that by turns you tried,
  Too fearful that you should not please.
  I loved you better for your fears,
  I knew you could not look but well;
  And dews, that would have fall'n in tears,
  I kiss'd away before they fell. [20]

  I watch'd the little flutterings,
  The doubt my mother would not see;
  She spoke at large of many things,
  And at the last she spoke of me;
  And turning look'd upon your face,
  As near this door you sat apart,
  And rose, and, with a silent grace
  Approaching, press'd you heart to heart. [21]

  Ah, well--but sing the foolish song
  I gave you, Alice, on the day [22]
  When, arm in arm, we went along,
  A pensive pair, and you were gay,
  With bridal flowers--that I may seem,
  As in the nights of old, to lie
  Beside the mill-wheel in the stream,
  While those full chestnuts whisper by. [23]

  It is the miller's daughter,
  And she is grown so dear, so dear,
  That I would be the jewel
  That trembles at [24] her ear:
  For hid in ringlets day and night,
  I'd touch her neck so warm and white.

  And I would be the girdle
  About her dainty, dainty waist,
  And her heart would beat against me,
  In sorrow and in rest:
  And I should know if it beat right,
  I'd clasp it round so close and tight. [25]

  And I would be the necklace,
  And all day long to fall and rise [26]
  Upon her balmy bosom,
  With her laughter or her sighs,
  And I would lie so light, so light, [27]
  I scarce should be [28] unclasp'd at night.

  A trifle, sweet! which true love spells
  True love interprets--right alone.
  His light upon the letter dwells,
  For all the spirit is his own. [29]
  So, if I waste words now, in truth
  You must blame Love. His early rage
  Had force to make me rhyme in youth
  And makes me talk too much in age. [30]

  And now those vivid hours are gone,
  Like mine own life to me thou art,
  Where Past and Present, wound in one,
  Do make a garland for the heart:
  So sing [31] that other song I made,
  Half anger'd with my happy lot,
  The day, when in the chestnut shade
  I found the blue Forget-me-not. [32]

  Love that hath us in the net, [33]
  Can he pass, and we forget?
  Many suns arise and set.
  Many a chance the years beget.
  Love the gift is Love the debt.
  Even so.
  Love is hurt with jar and fret.
  Love is made a vague regret.
  Eyes with idle tears are wet.
  Idle habit links us yet.
  What is love? for we forget:
  Ah, no! no!  [34]

  Look thro' mine eyes with thine. True wife,
  Round my true heart thine arms entwine;
  My other dearer life in life,
  Look thro' my very soul with thine!
  Untouch'd with any shade of years,
  May those kind eyes for ever dwell!
  They have not shed a many tears,
  Dear eyes, since first I knew them well.

  Yet tears they shed: they had their part
  Of sorrow: for when time was ripe,
  The still affection of the heart
  Became an outward breathing type,
  That into stillness past again,
  And left a want unknown before;
  Although the loss that brought us pain,
  That loss but made us love the more.

  With farther lookings on. The kiss,
  The woven arms, seem but to be
  Weak symbols of the settled bliss,
  The comfort, I have found in thee:
  But that God bless thee, dear--who wrought
  Two spirits to one equal mind--
  With blessings beyond hope or thought,
  With blessings which no words can find.

  Arise, and let us wander forth,
  To yon old mill across the wolds;
  For look, the sunset, south and north, [35]
  Winds all the vale in rosy folds,
  And fires your narrow casement glass,
  Touching the sullen pool below:
  On the chalk-hill the bearded grass
  Is dry and dewless. Let us go.

[Footnote 5: 1833.

  Looked down upon the village spire.
  I was a long and listless boy,
  And son and heir unto the squire.]

  I often heard the cooing dove
  In firry woodlands mourn alone.]


[Footnote 8:  1833.  The long mosses.]

[Footnote 9: 1842-1851.  Where.]

[Footnote 10:  This stanza was added in 1842, taking the place of the
following which was excised:--

  Sometimes I whistled in the wind,
  Sometimes I angled, thought and deed
  Torpid, as swallows left behind
  That winter 'neath the floating weed:
  At will to wander every way
  From brook to brook my sole delight,
  As lithe eels over meadows gray
  Oft shift their glimmering pool by night.

In 1833 this stanza ran thus:--

  I loved from off the bridge to hear
  The rushing sound the water made,
  And see the fish that everywhere
  In the back-current glanced and played;
  Low down the tall flag-flower that sprung
  Beside the noisy stepping-stones,
  And the massed chestnut boughs that hung
  Thick-studded over with white cones,]


[Footnote 11: In 1833 the following took the place of the above stanza
which was added in 1842:--

  How dear to me in youth, my love,
  Was everything about the mill,
  The black and silent pool above,
  The pool beneath that ne'er stood still,
  The meal sacks on the whitened floor,
  The dark round of the dripping wheel,
  The very air about the door--
  Made misty with the floating meal!

Thus in 1833:--

  Remember you that pleasant day
  When, after roving in the woods,
  ('Twas April then) I came and lay
  Beneath those gummy chestnut bud
  That glistened in the April blue,
  Upon the slope so smooth and cool,
  I lay and never thought of _you_,
  But angled in the deep mill pool.]


[Footnote 12: Thus in 1833:--

  A water-rat from off the bank
  Plunged in the stream. With idle care,
  Downlooking thro' the sedges rank,
  I saw your troubled image there.
  Upon the dark and dimpled beck
  It wandered like a floating light,
  A full fair form, a warm white neck,
  And two white arms--how rosy white!]


[Footnote 13: 1872. Casement-edge.]

[Footnote 14: Thus in 1833:--

  If you remember, you had set
  Upon the narrow casement-edge
  A long green box of mignonette,
  And you were leaning from the ledge.
  I raised my eyes at once: above
  They met two eyes so blue and bright,
  Such eyes! I swear to you, my love,
  That they have never lost their light.

After this stanza the following was inserted in 1833 but excised in
1842:--

  That slope beneath the chestnut tall
  Is wooed with choicest breaths of air:
  Methinks that I could tell you all
  The cowslips and the kingcups there.
  Each coltsfoot down the grassy bent,
  Whose round leaves hold the gathered shower,
  Each quaintly-folded cuckoo pint,
  And silver-paly cuckoo flower.]


[Footnote 15: Thus in 1833:--

  In rambling on the eastern wold,
  When thro' the showery April nights
  Their hueless crescent glimmered cold,
  From all the other village lights
  I knew your taper far away.
  My heart was full of trembling hope,
  Down from the wold I came and lay
  Upon the dewy-swarded slope.]


[Footnote 16; Mr. Cuming Walters in his interesting volume 'In Tennyson
Land', p. 75, notices that the white chalk quarry at Thetford can be
seen from Stockworth Mill, which seems to show that if Tennyson did take
the mill from Trumpington he must also have had his mind on Thetford
Mill. Tennyson seems to have taken delight in baffling those who wished
to localise his scenes. He went out of his way to say that the
topographical studies of Messrs. Church and Napier were the only ones
which could be relied upon. But Mr. Cuming Walters' book is far more
satisfactory than their thin studies.]

[Footnote 17: Thus in 1833:--

  The white chalk quarry from the hill
  Upon the broken ripple gleamed,
  I murmured lowly, sitting still,
  While round my feet the eddy streamed:
  "Oh! that I were the wreath she wreathes,
  The mirror where her sight she feeds,
  The song she sings, the air she breathes,
  The letters of the books she reads".]


[Footnote 18: 1833.

  I loved, but when I dared to speak
  My love, the lanes were white with May
  Your ripe lips moved not, but your cheek
  Flushed like the coming of the day.]


[Footnote 19: 1833. Rosecheekt, roselipt, half-sly, half-shy.]

[Footnote 20: Cf. Milton, 'Paradise Lost';--

  Two other precious drops that ready stood
  He, ere they fell, kiss'd.]


[Footnote 21: These three stanzas were added in 1842, the following
being excised:--

  Remember you the clear moonlight,
  That whitened all the eastern ridge,
  When o'er the water, dancing white,
  I stepped upon the old mill-bridge.
  I heard you whisper from above
  A lute-toned whisper, "I am here";
  I murmured, "Speak again, my love,
  The stream is loud: I cannot hear ".

  I heard, as I have seemed to hear,
  When all the under-air was still,
  The low voice of the glad new year
  Call to the freshly-flowered hill.
  I heard, as I have often heard
  The nightingale in leavy woods
  Call to its mate, when nothing stirred
  To left or right but falling floods.]


[Footnote 22: 1842. I gave you on the joyful day.]

[Footnote 23: In 1833 the following stanza took the place of the one
here substituted in 1842:--

  Come, Alice, sing to me the song
  I made you on our marriage day,
  When, arm in arm, we went along
  Half-tearfully, and you were gay
  With brooch and ring: for I shall seem,
  The while you sing that song, to hear
  The mill-wheel turning in the stream,
  And the green chestnut whisper near.

In 1833 the song began thus, the present stanza taking its place in
1842:--

  I wish I were her earring,
  Ambushed in auburn ringlets sleek,
  (So might my shadow tremble
  Over her downy cheek),
  Hid in her hair, all day and night,
  Touching her neck so warm and white.]


[Footnote 24: 1872. In.]

[Footnote 25: 1833.

  I wish I were the girdle
  Buckled about her dainty waist,
  That her heart might beat against me,
  In sorrow and in rest.
  I should know well if it beat right,
  I'd clasp it round so close and tight.

This stanza bears so close a resemblance to a stanza in Joshua
Sylvester's 'Woodman's Bear' (see Sylvester's 'Works', ed. 1641, p. 616)
that a correspondent asked Tennyson whether Sylvester had suggested it.
Tennyson replied that he had never seen Sylvester's lines ('Life of
Tennyson', iii., 51). The lines are:--

  But her slender virgin waste
  Made mee beare her girdle spight
  Which the same by day imbrac't
  Though it were cast off by night
  That I wisht, I dare not say,
  To be girdle night and day.

For other parallels see the present Editor's 'Illustrations of
Tennyson', p. 39.]


[Footnote 26: 1833.

  I wish I were her necklace,
  So might I ever fall and rise.]


[Footnote 27: 1833. So warm and light.]

[Footnote 28: 1833. I would not be.]

[Footnote 29: 1833.

  For o'er each letter broods and dwells,
  (Like light from running waters thrown
  On flowery swaths) the blissful flame
  Of his sweet eyes, that, day and night,
  With pulses thrilling thro' his frame
  Do inly tremble, starry bright.]


[Footnote 30: Thus in 1833:--

  How I waste language--yet in truth
  You must blame love, whose early rage
  Made me a rhymster in my youth,
  And over-garrulous in age.]


[Footnote 31: 1833. Sing me.]

[Footnote 32: 1833.

  When in the breezy limewood-shade.
  I found the blue forget-me-not.]


[Footnote 33: In 1833 the following song took the place of the song in
the text:--

  All yesternight you met me not,
  My ladylove, forget me not.
  When I am gone, regret me not.
  But, here or there, forget me not.
  With your arched eyebrow threat me not,
  And tremulous eyes, like April skies,
  That seem to say, "forget me not,"
  I pray you, love, forget me not.

  In idle sorrow set me not;
  Regret me not; forget me not;
  Oh! leave me not: oh, let me not
  Wear quite away;--forget me not.
  With roguish laughter fret me not.
  From dewy eyes, like April skies,
  That ever _look_, "forget me not".
  Blue as the blue forget-me-not.]


[Footnote 34: These two stanzas were added in 1842.]

[Footnote 35: 1833.

  I've half a mind to walk, my love,
  To the old mill across the wolds
  For look! the sunset from above,]





FATIMA

First printed in 1833.

The 1833 edition has no title but this quotation from Sappho prefixed:--

'Phainetai moi kaenos isos theoisin Emmen anaer'--SAPPHO.

The title was prefixed in 1842; it is a name taken from 'The Arabian
Nights' or from the Moallakat. The poem was evidently inspired by
Sappho's great ode. 'Cf.' also Fragment I. of Ibycus. In the intensity
of the passion it stands alone among Tennyson's poems.


  O Love, Love, Love! O withering might!
  O sun, that from [1] thy noonday height
  Shudderest when I strain my sight,
  Throbbing thro' all thy heat and light,
  Lo, falling from my constant mind,
  Lo, parch'd and wither'd, deaf and blind,
  I whirl like leaves in roaring wind.

  Last night I wasted hateful hours
  Below the city's eastern towers:
  I thirsted for the brooks, the showers:
  I roll'd among the tender flowers:
  I crush'd them on my breast, my mouth:
  I look'd athwart the burning drouth
  Of that long desert to the south. [2]

  Last night, when some one spoke his name, [3]
  From my swift blood that went and came
  A thousand little shafts of flame.
  Were shiver'd in my narrow frame
  O Love, O fire! once he drew
  With one long kiss, my whole soul thro'
  My lips, as sunlight drinketh dew. [4]

  Before he mounts the hill, I know
  He cometh quickly: from below
  Sweet gales, as from deep gardens, blow
  Before him, striking on my brow.
  In my dry brain my spirit soon,
  Down-deepening from swoon to swoon,
  Faints like a dazzled morning moon.

  The wind sounds like a silver wire,
  And from beyond the noon a fire
  Is pour'd upon the hills, and nigher
  The skies stoop down in their desire;
  And, isled in sudden seas of light,
  My heart, pierced thro' with fierce delight,
  Bursts into blossom in his sight.

  My whole soul waiting silently,
  All naked in a sultry sky,
  Droops blinded with his shining eye:
  I 'will' possess him or will die.
  I will grow round him in his place,
  Grow, live, die looking on his face,
  Die, dying clasp'd in his embrace.


[Footnote 1: 1833. At.]

[Footnote 2: This stanza was added in 1842.]

[Footnote 3: 'Cf.' Byron, 'Occasional Pieces':--

They name thee before me A knell to mine ear, A shudder comes o'er me,
Why wert thou so dear?]


[Footnote 4: 'Cf,' Achilles Tatius, 'Clitophon and Leucippe', bk. i., I:

[Greek: 'AEde (psyche) tarachtheisa tps philaemati palletai, ei de
mae tois splagchnois in dedemenae aekolouthaesen an elkaetheisa ano tois
philaemasin.']

(Her soul, distracted by the kiss, throbs, and had it not been close
bound by the flesh would have followed, drawn upward by the kisses.)]




?NONE

First published in 1833, On being republished in 1842 this poem was
practically rewritten, the alterations and additions so transforming the
poem as to make it almost a new work. I have therefore printed a
complete transcript of the edition of 1833, which the reader can
compare. The final text is, with the exception of one alteration which
will be noticed, precisely that of 1842, so there is no trouble with
variants. '?none' is the first of Tennyson's fine classical studies. The
poem is modelled partly on the Alexandrian Idyll, such an Idyll for
instance as the second Idyll of Theocritus or the 'Megara' or 'Europa'
of Moschus, and partly perhaps on the narratives in the 'Metamorphoses'
of Ovid, to which the opening bears a typical resemblance. It is
possible that the poem may have been suggested by Beattie's 'Judgment of
Paris' which tells the same story, and tells it on the same lines on
which it is told here, though it is not placed in the mouth of ?none.
Beattie's poem opens with an elaborate description of Ida and of Troy in
the distance. Paris, the husband of ?none, is one afternoon confronted
with the three goddesses who are, as in Tennyson's Idyll, elaborately
delineated as symbolising what they here symbolise. Each makes her
speech and each offers what she has to offer, worldly dominion, wisdom,
sensual pleasure. There is, of course, no comparison in point of merit
between the two poems, Beattie's being in truth perfectly commonplace.
In its symbolic aspect the poem may be compared with the temptations to
which Christ is submitted in 'Paradise Regained'. See books iii. and iv.


  There lies a vale in Ida, lovelier [1]
  Than all the valleys of Ionian hills.
  The swimming vapour slopes athwart the glen,
  Puts forth an arm, and creeps from pine to pine,
  And loiters, slowly drawn. On either hand
  The lawns and meadow-ledges midway down
  Hang rich in flowers, and far below them roars
  The long brook falling thro' the clov'n ravine
  In cataract after cataract to the sea.
  Behind the valley topmost Gargarus [2]
  Stands up and takes the morning: but in front
  The gorges, opening wide apart, reveal
  Troas and Ilion's column'd citadel,
  The crown of Troas.

  Hither came at noon
  Mournful ?none, wandering forlorn
  Of Paris, once her playmate on the hills.
  Her cheek had lost the rose, and round her neck
  Floated her hair or seem'd to float in rest.
  She, leaning on a fragment twined with vine,
  Sang to the stillness, till the mountain-shade
  Sloped downward to her seat from the upper cliff.

  "O mother Ida, many-fountain'd [3] Ida,
  Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  For now the noonday quiet holds the hill: [4]
  The grasshopper is silent in the grass;
  The lizard, with his shadow on the stone, [5]
  Rests like a shadow, and the cicala sleeps. [6]
  The purple flowers droop: the golden bee
  Is lily-cradled: I alone awake.
  My eyes are full of tears, my heart of love,
  My heart is breaking, and my eyes are dim, [7]
  And I am all aweary of my life.

  "O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida,
  Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  Hear me O Earth, hear me O Hills, O Caves
  That house the cold crown'd snake! O mountain brooks,
  I am the daughter of a River-God, [8]
  Hear me, for I will speak, and build up all
  My sorrow with my song, as yonder walls
  Rose slowly to a music slowly breathed, [9]
  A cloud that gather'd shape: for it may be
  That, while I speak of it, a little while
  My heart may wander from its deeper woe.

  "O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida,
  Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  I waited underneath the dawning hills,
  Aloft the mountain lawn was dewy-dark,
  And dewy-dark aloft the mountain pine:
  Beautiful Paris, evil-hearted Paris,
  Leading a jet-black goat white-horn'd, white-hooved,
  Came up from reedy Simois [10] all alone.

  "O mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  Far-off the torrent call'd me from the cleft:
  Far up the solitary morning smote
  The streaks of virgin snow. With down-dropt eyes
  I sat alone: white-breasted like a star
  Fronting the dawn he moved; a leopard skin
  Droop'd from his shoulder, but his sunny hair
  Cluster'd about his temples like a God's;
  And his cheek brighten'd as the foam-bow brightens
  When the wind blows the foam, and all my heart
  Went forth to embrace him coming ere he came.

  "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  He smiled, and opening out his milk-white palm
  Disclosed a fruit of pure Hesperian gold,
  That smelt ambrosially, and while I look'd
  And listen'd, the full-flowing river of speech
  Came down upon my heart.

  "'My own ?none,
  Beautiful-brow'd ?none, my own soul,
  Behold this fruit, whose gleaming rind ingrav'n
  "For the most fair," would seem to award it thine,
  As lovelier than whatever Oread haunt
  The knolls of Ida, loveliest in all grace
  Of movement, and the charm of married brows.'[11]

  "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  He prest the blossom of his lips to mine,
  And added 'This was cast upon the board,
  When all the full-faced presence of the Gods
  Ranged in the halls of Peleus; whereupon
  Rose feud, with question unto whom 'twere due:
  But light-foot Iris brought it yester-eve,
  Delivering, that to me, by common voice
  Elected umpire, Here comes to-day,
  Pallas and Aphrodite, claiming each
  This meed of fairest. Thou, within the cave
  Behind yon whispering tuft of oldest pine,
  Mayst well behold them unbeheld, unheard
  Hear all, and see thy Paris judge of Gods.'

  "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  It was the deep midnoon: one silvery cloud
  Had lost his way between the piney sides
  Of this long glen. Then to the bower they came,
  Naked they came to that smooth-swarded bower,
  And at their feet the crocus brake like fire,[12]
  Violet, amaracus, and asphodel,
  Lotos and lilies: and a wind arose,
  And overhead the wandering ivy and vine,
  This way and that, in many a wild festoon
  Ran riot, garlanding the gnarled boughs
  With bunch and berry and flower thro' and thro'.

  "O mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  On the tree-tops a crested peacock lit,
  And o'er him flow'd a golden cloud, and lean'd
  Upon him, slowing dropping fragrant dew.
  Then first I heard the voice of her, to whom
  Coming thro' Heaven, like a light that grows
  Larger and clearer, with one mind the Gods
  Rise up for reverence. She to Paris made
  Proffer of royal power, ample rule
  Unquestion'd, overflowing revenue
  Wherewith to embellish state, 'from many a vale
  And river-sunder'd champaign clothed with corn,
  Or labour'd mines undrainable of ore.
  Honour,' she said, 'and homage, tax and toll,
  From many an inland town and haven large,
  Mast-throng'd beneath her shadowing citadel
  In glassy bays among her tallest towers.'

  "O mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  Still she spake on and still she spake of power,
  'Which in all action is the end of all;
  Power fitted to the season; wisdom-bred
  And throned of wisdom--from all neighbour crowns
  Alliance and allegiance, till thy hand
  Fail from the sceptre staff. Such boon from me,
  From me, Heaven's Queen, Paris to thee king-born,
  A shepherd all thy life but yet king-born,
  Should come most welcome, seeing men, in power
  Only, are likest gods, who have attain'd
  Rest in a happy place and quiet seats
  Above the thunder, with undying bliss
  In knowledge of their own supremacy.'

  "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  She ceased, and Paris held the costly fruit
  Out at arm's-length, so much the thought of power
  Flatter'd his spirit; but Pallas where she stood
  Somewhat apart, her clear and bared limbs
  O'erthwarted with the brazen-headed spear
  Upon her pearly shoulder leaning cold,
  The while, above, her full and earnest eye
  Over her snow-cold breast and angry cheek [13]
  Kept watch, waiting decision, made reply.

  "'Self-reverence, self-knowledge, self-control,
  These three alone lead life to sovereign power.
  Yet not for power, (power of herself
  Would come uncall'd for) but to live by law,
  Acting the law we live by without fear;
  And, because right is right, to follow right [14]
  Were wisdom in the scorn of consequence.'

  "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  Again she said: 'I woo thee not with gifts.
  Sequel of guerdon could not alter me
  To fairer. Judge thou me by what I am,
  So shalt thou find me fairest. Yet indeed,

  If gazing on divinity disrobed
  Thy mortal eyes are frail to judge of fair,
  Unbiass'd by self-profit, oh! rest thee sure
  That I shall love thee well and cleave to thee,

  So that my vigour, wedded to thy blood, [15]
  Shall strike within thy pulses, like a God's,
  To push thee forward thro' a life of shocks,
  Dangers, and deeds, until endurance grow
  Sinew'd with action, and the full-grown will.
  Circled thro' all experiences, pure law,
  Commeasure perfect freedom.' "Here she ceased,
  And Paris ponder'd, and I cried, 'O Paris,
  Give it to Pallas!' but he heard me not,
  Or hearing would not hear me, woe is me!

  "O mother Ida, many-fountain'd Ida.
  Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  Idalian Aphrodite, beautiful,
  Fresh as the foam, new-bathed in Paphian [16] wells,
  With rosy slender fingers backward drew
  From her warm brows and bosom [17] her deep hair
  Ambrosial, golden round her lucid throat
  And shoulder: from the violets her light foot
  Shone rosy-white, and o'er her rounded form
  Between the shadows of the vine-bunches
  Floated the glowing sunlights, as she moved.

  "Dear mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  She with a subtle smile in her mild eyes,
  The herald of her triumph, drawing nigh
  Half-whisper'd in his ear, 'I promise thee
  The fairest and most loving wife in Greece'.
  She spoke and laugh'd: I shut my sight for fear:
  But when I look'd, Paris had raised his arm,
  And I beheld great Here's angry eyes,
  As she withdrew into the golden cloud,
  And I was left alone within the bower;
  And from that time to this I am alone,
  And I shall be alone until I die.

  "Yet, mother Ida, harken ere I die.
  Fairest--why fairest wife? am I not fair?
  My love hath told me so a thousand times.
  Methinks I must be fair, for yesterday,
  When I past by, a wild and wanton pard,
  Eyed like the evening star, with playful tail
  Crouch'd fawning in the weed. Most loving is she?
  Ah me, my mountain shepherd, that my arms
  Were wound about thee, and my hot lips prest
  Close, close to thine in that quick-falling dew
  Of fruitful kisses, thick as Autumn rains
  Flash in the pools of whirling Simois.

  "O mother, hear me yet before I die.
  They came, they cut away my tallest pines,
  My dark tall pines, that plumed the craggy ledge
  High over the blue gorge, and all between
  The snowy peak and snow-white cataract
  Foster'd the callow eaglet--from beneath
  Whose thick mysterious boughs in the dark morn
  The panther's roar came muffled, while I sat
  Low in the valley. Never, never more
  Shall lone ?none see the morning mist
  Sweep thro' them; never see them overlaid
  With narrow moon-lit slips of silver cloud,
  Between the loud stream and the trembling stars.

  "O mother, here me yet before I die.
  I wish that somewhere in the ruin'd folds,
  Among the fragments tumbled from the glens,
  Or the dry thickets, I could meet with her,
  The Abominable, [18] that uninvited came
  Into the fair Peleian banquet-hall,
  And cast the golden fruit upon the board,
  And bred this change; that I might speak my mind,
  And tell her to her face how much I hate
  Her presence, hated both of Gods and men.

  "O mother, here me yet before I die.
  Hath he not sworn his love a thousand times,
  In this green valley, under this green hill,
  Ev'n on this hand, and sitting on this stone?
  Seal'd it with kisses? water'd it with tears?
  O happy tears, and how unlike to these!
  O happy Heaven, how canst thou see my face?
  O happy earth, how canst thou bear my weight?
  O death, death, death, thou ever-floating cloud,
  There are enough unhappy on this earth,
  Pass by the happy souls, that love to live:
  I pray thee, pass before my light of life,
  And shadow all my soul, that I may die.
  Thou weighest heavy on the heart within,
  Weigh heavy on my eyelids: let me die.

  "O mother, hear me yet before I die.
  I will not die alone, for fiery thoughts
  Do shape themselves within me, more and more,
  Whereof I catch the issue, as I hear
  Dead sounds at night come from the inmost hills,
  Like footsteps upon wool. I dimly see
  My far-off doubtful purpose, as a mother
  Conjectures of the features of her child
  Ere it is born: her child!--a shudder comes
  Across me: never child be born of me,
  Unblest, to vex me with his father's eyes!

  "O mother, hear me yet before I die.
  Hear me, O earth. I will not die alone,
  Lest their shrill happy laughter come to me
  Walking the cold and starless road of
  Death Uncomforted, leaving my ancient love
  With the Greek woman. [19] I will rise and go
  Down into Troy, and ere the stars come forth
  Talk with the wild Cassandra, [20] for she says
  A fire dances before her, and a sound
  Rings ever in her ears of armed men.
  What this may be I know not, but I know
  That, wheresoe'er I am by night and day,
  All earth and air seem only burning fire."



[1833.]

  There is a dale in Ida, lovelier
  Than any in old Ionia, beautiful
  With emerald slopes of sunny sward, that lean
  Above the loud glenriver, which hath worn
  A path thro' steepdown granite walls below
  Mantled with flowering tendriltwine. In front
  The cedarshadowy valleys open wide.
  Far-seen, high over all the God-built wall
  And many a snowycolumned range divine,
  Mounted with awful sculptures--men and Gods,
  The work of Gods--bright on the dark-blue sky
  The windy citadel of Ilion
  Shone, like the crown of Troas. Hither came
  Mournful ?none wandering forlorn
  Of Paris, once her playmate. Round her neck,
  Her neck all marblewhite and marblecold,
  Floated her hair or seemed to float in rest.
  She, leaning on a vine-entwined stone,
  Sang to the stillness, till the mountain-shadow
  Sloped downward to her seat from the upper cliff.

  "O mother Ida, manyfountained Ida,
  Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.
  The grasshopper is silent in the grass,
  The lizard with his shadow on the stone
  Sleeps like a shadow, and the scarletwinged [21]
  Cicala in the noonday leapeth not
  Along the water-rounded granite-rock.
  The purple flower droops: the golden bee
  Is lilycradled: I alone awake.
  My eyes are full of tears, my heart of love,
  My heart is breaking and my eyes are dim,
  And I am all aweary of my life.

  "O mother Ida, manyfountained Ida,
  Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.
  Hear me O Earth, hear me O Hills, O Caves
  That house the cold crowned snake! O mountain brooks,
  I am the daughter of a River-God,
  Hear me, for I will speak, and build up all
  My sorrow with my song, as yonder walls
  Rose slowly to a music slowly breathed,
  A cloud that gathered shape: for it may be
  That, while I speak of it, a little while
  My heart may wander from its deeper woe.

  "O mother Ida, manyfountained Ida,
  Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.
  Aloft the mountain lawn was dewydark,
  And dewydark aloft the mountain pine;
  Beautiful Paris, evil-hearted Paris,
  Leading a jetblack goat whitehorned, whitehooved,
  Came up from reedy Simois all alone.

  "O mother Ida, hearken ere I die.
  I sate alone: the goldensandalled morn
  Rosehued the scornful hills: I sate alone
  With downdropt eyes: white-breasted like a star
  Fronting the dawn he came: a leopard skin
  From his white shoulder drooped: his sunny hair
  Clustered about his temples like a God's:
  And his cheek brightened, as the foambow brightens
  When the wind blows the foam; and I called out,
  'Welcome Apollo, welcome home Apollo,
  Apollo, my Apollo, loved Apollo'.

  "Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.
  He, mildly smiling, in his milk-white palm
  Close-held a golden apple, lightningbright
  With changeful flashes, dropt with dew of Heaven
  Ambrosially smelling. From his lip,
  Curved crimson, the full-flowing river of speech
  Came down upon my heart.

                           "' My own ?none,
  Beautifulbrowed ?none, mine own soul,
  Behold this fruit, whose gleaming rind ingrav'n
  "For the most fair," in aftertime may breed
  Deep evilwilledness of heaven and sore
  Heartburning toward hallowed Ilion;
  And all the colour of my afterlife
  Will be the shadow of to-day. To-day
  Hera and Pallas and the floating grace
  Of laughter-loving Aphrodite meet
  In manyfolded Ida to receive
  This meed of beauty, she to whom my hand
  Award the palm. Within the green hillside,
  Under yon whispering tuft of oldest pine,
  Is an ingoing grotto, strown with spar
  And ivymatted at the mouth, wherein
  Thou unbeholden may'st behold, unheard
  Hear all, and see thy Paris judge of Gods.'

  "Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.
  It was the deep midnoon: one silvery cloud
  Had lost his way between the piney hills.
  They came--all three--the Olympian goddesses.
  Naked they came to the smoothswarded bower,
  Lustrous with lilyflower, violeteyed
  Both white and blue, with lotetree-fruit thickset,
  Shadowed with singing-pine; and all the while,
  Above, the overwandering ivy and vine
  This way and that in many a wild festoon
  Ran riot, garlanding the gnarled boughs
  With bunch and berry and flower thro' and thro'.
  On the treetops a golden glorious cloud
  Leaned, slowly dropping down ambrosial dew.
  How beautiful they were, too beautiful
  To look upon! but Paris was to me
  More lovelier than all the world beside.

  "O mother Ida, hearken ere I die.
  First spake the imperial Olympian
  With arched eyebrow smiling sovranly,
  Fulleyed here. She to Paris made
  Proffer of royal power, ample rule
  Unquestioned, overflowing revenue
  Wherewith to embellish state, 'from many a vale
  And river-sundered champaign clothed with corn,
  Or upland glebe wealthy in oil and wine--
  Honour and homage, tribute, tax and toll,
  From many an inland town and haven large,
  Mast-thronged below her shadowing citadel
  In glassy bays among her tallest towers.'

  "O mother Ida, hearken ere I die.
  Still she spake on and still she spake of power
  'Which in all action is the end of all.
  Power fitted to the season, measured by
  The height of the general feeling, wisdomborn
  And throned of wisdom--from all neighbour crowns
  Alliance and allegiance evermore. Such boon from me
  Heaven's Queen to thee kingborn,
  A shepherd all thy life and yet kingborn,
  Should come most welcome, seeing men, in this
  Only are likest gods, who have attained
  Rest in a happy place and quiet seats
  Above the thunder, with undying bliss
  In knowledge of their own supremacy;
  The changeless calm of undisputed right,
  The highest height and topmost strength of power.'

  "Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.
  She ceased, and Paris held the costly fruit
  Out at arm's length, so much the thought of power
  Flattered his heart: but Pallas where she stood
  Somewhat apart, her clear and bared limbs
  O'erthwarted with the brazen-headed spear
  Upon her pearly shoulder leaning cold;
  The while, above, her full and earnest eye
  Over her snowcold breast and angry cheek
  Kept watch, waiting decision, made reply.

  "'Selfreverence, selfknowledge, selfcontrol
  Are the three hinges of the gates of Life,
  That open into power, everyway
  Without horizon, bound or shadow or cloud.
  Yet not for power (power of herself
  Will come uncalled-for) but to live by law
  Acting the law we live by without fear,
  And, because right is right, to follow right
  Were wisdom, in the scorn of consequence.

  (Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.)
  Not as men value gold because it tricks
  And blazons outward Life with ornament,
  But rather as the miser, for itself.
  Good for selfgood doth half destroy selfgood.
  The means and end, like two coiled snakes, infect
  Each other, bound in one with hateful love.
  So both into the fountain and the stream
  A drop of poison falls. Come hearken to me,
  And look upon me and consider me,
  So shall thou find me fairest, so endurance,
  Like to an athlete's arm, shall still become
  Sinewed with motion, till thine active will
  (As the dark body of the Sun robed round
  With his own ever-emanating lights)
  Be flooded o'er with her own effluences,
  And thereby grow to freedom.' "Here she ceased
  And Paris pondered. I cried out, 'Oh, Paris,
  Give it to Pallas!' but he heard me not,
  Or hearing would not hear me, woe is me!

  "O mother Ida, manyfountained Ida,
  Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.
  Idalian Aphrodite oceanborn,
  Fresh as the foam, newbathed in Paphian wells,
  With rosy slender fingers upward drew
  From her warm brow and bosom her dark hair
  Fragrant and thick, and on her head upbound
  In a purple band: below her lucid neck
  Shone ivorylike, and from the ground her foot
  Gleamed rosywhite, and o'er her rounded form
  Between the shadows of the vine-bunches
  Floated the glowing sunlights, as she moved.

  "Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.
  She with a subtle smile in her mild eyes,
  The herald of her triumph, drawing nigh
  Half-whispered in his ear, 'I promise thee
  The fairest and most loving wife in Greece'.
  I only saw my Paris raise his arm:
  I only saw great Here's angry eyes,
  As she withdrew into the golden cloud,
  And I was left alone within the bower;
  And from that time to this I am alone.
  And I shall be alone until I die.

  "Yet, mother Ida, hearken ere I die.
  Fairest--why fairest wife? am I not fair?
  My love hath told me so a thousand times.
  Methinks I must be fair, for yesterday,
  When I passed by, a wild and wanton pard,
  Eyed like the evening star, with playful tail
  Crouched fawning in the weed. Most loving is she?
  Ah me, my mountain shepherd, that my arms
  Were wound about thee, and my hot lips prest
  Close-close to thine in that quickfalling dew
  Of fruitful kisses, thick as Autumn rains
  Flash in the pools of whirling Simois.

  "Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.
  They came, they cut away my tallest pines--
  My dark tall pines, that plumed the craggy ledge
  High over the blue gorge, or lower down
  Filling greengulphed Ida, all between
  The snowy peak and snowwhite cataract
  Fostered the callow eaglet--from beneath
  Whose thick mysterious boughs in the dark
  The panther's roar came muffled, while I sat
  Low in the valley. Never, nevermore
  Shall lone ?none see the morning mist
  Sweep thro' them--never see them overlaid
  With narrow moon-lit slips of silver cloud,
  Between the loud stream and the trembling stars.

  "Oh! mother Ida, hearken ere I die.
  Hath he not sworn his love a thousand times,
  In this green valley, under this green hill,
  Ev'n on this hand, and sitting on this stone?
  Sealed it with kisses? watered it with tears?
  Oh happy tears, and how unlike to these!
  Oh happy Heaven, how can'st thou see my face?
  Oh happy earth, how can'st thou bear my weight?
  O death, death, death, thou ever-floating cloud,
  There are enough unhappy on this earth,
  Pass by the happy souls, that love to live:
  I pray thee, pass before my light of life.
  And shadow all my soul, that I may die.
  Thou weighest heavy on the heart within,
  Weigh heavy on my eyelids--let me die.

  "Yet, mother Ida, hear me ere I die.
  I will not die alone, for fiery thoughts
  Do shape themselves within me, more and more,
  Whereof I catch the issue, as I hear
  Dead sounds at night come from the inmost hills,
  Like footsteps upon wool. I dimly see
  My far-off doubtful purpose, as a mother
  Conjectures of the features of her child
  Ere it is born. I will not die alone.

  "Dear mother Ida, hearken ere I die.
  Hear me, O earth. I will not die alone,
  Lest their shrill, happy laughter, etc.

began '?none' while he and Arthur Hallam were in Spain, whither they
went with money for the insurgent allies of Torrigos in the summer of
1830. He wrote part of it in the valley of Cauteretz in the Pyrenees,
the picturesque beauty of which fascinated him and not only suggested
the scenery of this Idyll, but inspired many years afterwards the poem
'All along the valley'. The exquisite scene with which the Idyll opens
bears no resemblance at all to Mount Ida and the Troad.]

[Footnote 6: This extraordinary mistake in natural history (the cicala
being of course loudest in mid noonday when the heat is greatest)
Tennyson allowed to stand, till securing accuracy at the heavy price of
a pointless pleonasm, he substituted in 1884 "and the winds are dead".]

It was probably an application of the Theban legend of Amphion, and
arose from the association of Apollo with Poseidon in founding Troy.

[Footnote 13: The "'angry' cheek" is a fine touch.]

[Footnote 14: This fine sentiment is, of course, a commonplace among

passage from Cicero, 'De Finibus', ii., 14, 45:

  "Honestum id intelligimus quod tale est ut, detracta omni utilitate,
  sine ullis praemiis fructibusve per se ipsum possit jure laudari".

  We are to understand by the truly honourable that which, setting aside
  all consideration of utility, may be rightly praised in itself,
  exclusive of any prospect of reward or compensation.]


[Footnote 15: This passage is very obscurely expressed, but the general
meaning is clear: "Until endurance grow sinewed with action, and the
full-grown will, circled through all experiences grow or become law, be
identified with law, and commeasure perfect freedom". The true moral
ideal is to bring the will into absolute harmony with law, so that
virtuous action becomes an instinct, the will no longer rebelling
against the law, "service" being in very truth "perfect freedom".]

THE SISTERS


First published in 1833.

The only alterations which have been made in it since have simply
consisted in the alteration of "'an'" for "and" in the third line of
each stanza, and "through and through" for "thro' and thro'" in line 29,
and "wrapt" for "wrapped" in line 34. It is curious that in 1842 the
original "bad" was altered to "bade," but all subsequent editions keep
to the original. It has been said that this poem was founded on the old
Scotch ballad "The Twa Sisters" (see for that ballad Sharpe's 'Ballad
Book', No. x., p. 30), but there is no resemblance at all between the
ballad and this poem beyond the fact that in each there are two sisters
who are both loved by a certain squire, the elder in jealousy pushing
the younger into a river and drowning her.


  We were two daughters of one race:
  She was the fairest in the face:
  The wind is blowing in turret and tree.
  They were together and she fell;
  Therefore revenge became me well.
  O the Earl was fair to see!

  She died: she went to burning flame:
  She mix'd her ancient blood with shame.
  The wind is howling in turret and tree.
  Whole weeks and months, and early and late,
  To win his love I lay in wait:
  O the Earl was fair to see!

  I made a feast; I bad him come;
  I won his love, I brought him home.
  The wind is roaring in turret and tree.
  And after supper, on a bed,
  Upon my lap he laid his head:
  O the Earl was fair to see!

  I kiss'd his eyelids into rest:
  His ruddy cheek upon my breast.
  The wind is raging in turret and tree.
  I hated him with the hate of hell,
  But I loved his beauty passing well.
  O the Earl was fair to see!

  I rose up in the silent night:
  I made my dagger sharp and bright.
  The wind is raving in turret and tree.
  As half-asleep his breath he drew,
  Three times I stabb'd him thro' and thro'.
  O the Earl was fair to see!

  I curl'd and comb'd his comely head,
  He look'd so grand when he was dead.
  The wind is blowing in turret and tree.
  I wrapt his body in the sheet,
  And laid him at his mother's feet.
  O the Earl was fair to see!





TO-----

WITH THE FOLLOWING POEM

I have not been able to ascertain to whom this dedication was addressed.
Sir Franklin Lushington tells me that he thinks it was an imaginary
person. The dedication explains the allegory intended. The poem appears
to have been suggested, as we learn from 'Tennyson's Life' (vol. i., p.
150), by a remark of Trench to Tennyson when they were undergraduates at
Trinity: "We cannot live in art". It was the embodiment Tennyson added
of his belief "that the God-like life is with man and for man". 'Cf.'
his own lines in 'Love and Duty':--$

  For a man is not as God,
  But then most God-like being most a man.

It is a companion poem to the 'Vision of Sin'; in that poem is traced
the effect of indulgence in the grosser pleasures of sense, in this the
effect of the indulgence in the more refined pleasures of sense.


  I send you here a sort of allegory,
  (For you will understand it) of a soul, [1]
  A sinful soul possess'd of many gifts,
  A spacious garden full of flowering weeds,
  A glorious Devil, large in heart and brain,
  That did love Beauty only, (Beauty seen
  In all varieties of mould and mind)
  And Knowledge for its beauty; or if Good,
  Good only for its beauty, seeing not
  That beauty, Good, and Knowledge, are three sisters
  That doat upon each other, friends to man,
  Living together under the same roof,
  And never can be sunder'd without tears.
  And he that shuts Love out, in turn shall be
  Shut out from Love, and on her threshold lie
  Howling in outer darkness. Not for this
  Was common clay ta'en from the common earth,
  Moulded by God, and temper'd with the tears
  Of angels to the perfect shape of man.


[Footnote 1: 1833.

I send you, Friend, a sort of allegory,
(You are an artist and will understand
Its many lesser meanings) of a soul.]






THE PALACE OF ART

First published in 1833, but altered so extensively on its republication
in 1842 as to be practically rewritten. The alterations in it after 1842
were not numerous, consisting chiefly in the deletion of two stanzas
after line 192 and the insertion of the three stanzas which follow in
the present text, together with other minor verbal corrections, all of
which have been noted. No alterations were made in the text after 1853.
The allegory Tennyson explains in the dedicatory verses, but the
framework of the poem was evidently suggested by 'Ecclesiastes' ii.
1-17. The position of the hero is precisely that of Solomon. Both began
by assuming that man is self-sufficing and the world sufficient; the
verdict of the one in consequence being "vanity of vanities, all is
vanity," of the other what the poet here records. An admirable
commentary on the poem is afforded by Matthew Arnold's picture of the
Romans before Christ taught the secret of the only real happiness
possible to man. See 'Obermann Once More'. The teaching of the poem
has been admirably explained by Spedding. It "represents allegorically
the condition of a mind which, in the love of beauty and the triumphant
consciousness of knowledge and intellectual supremacy, in the intense
enjoyment of its own power and glory, has lost sight of its relation to
man and God". See 'Tennyson's Life', vol. i., p. 226.



  I built my soul a lordly pleasure-house
  Wherein at ease for aye to dwell.
  I said, "O Soul, make merry and carouse,
  Dear soul, for all is well".

  A huge crag-platform, smooth as burnish'd brass,
  I chose. The ranged ramparts bright
  From level meadow-bases of deep grass [1]
  Suddenly scaled the light.

  Thereon I built it firm. Of ledge or shelf
  The rock rose clear, or winding stair.
  My soul would live alone unto herself
  In her high palace there.

  And "while the world [2] runs round and round,"
  I said, "Reign thou apart, a quiet king,
  Still as, while Saturn [3] whirls, his stedfast [4] shade
  Sleeps on his luminous [5] ring."

  To which my soul made answer readily:
  "Trust me, in bliss I shall abide
  In this great mansion, that is built for me,
  So royal-rich and wide"

  *       *       *       *      *

  Four courts I made, East, West and South and North,
  In each a squared lawn, wherefrom
  The golden gorge of dragons spouted forth
  A flood of fountain-foam. [6]

  And round the cool green courts there ran a row
  Of cloisters, branch'd like mighty woods,
  Echoing all night to that sonorous flow
  Of spouted fountain-floods. [6]

  And round the roofs a gilded gallery
  That lent broad verge to distant lands,
  Far as the wild swan wings, to where the sky
  Dipt down to sea and sands. [6]

  From those four jets four currents in one swell
  Across the mountain stream'd below
  In misty folds, that floating as they fell
  Lit up a torrent-bow. [6]

  And high on every peak a statue seem'd
  To hang on tiptoe, tossing up
  A cloud of incense of all odour steam'd
  From out a golden cup. [6]

  So that she thought, "And who shall gaze upon
  My palace with unblinded eyes,
  While this great bow will waver in the sun,
  And that sweet incense rise?" [6]

  For that sweet incense rose and never fail'd,
  And, while day sank or mounted higher,
  The light aerial gallery, golden-rail'd,
  Burnt like a fringe of fire. [6]

  Likewise the deep-set windows, stain'd and traced,
  Would seem slow-flaming crimson fires
  From shadow'd grots of arches interlaced,
  And tipt with frost-like spires. [6]

  *       *       *       *       *

  Full of long-sounding corridors it was,
  That over-vaulted grateful gloom, [7]
  Thro' which the livelong day my soul did pass,
  Well-pleased, from room to room.

  Full of great rooms and small the palace stood,
  All various, each a perfect whole
  From living Nature, fit for every mood [8]
  And change of my still soul.

  For some were hung with arras green and blue,
  Showing a gaudy summer-morn,
  Where with puff'd cheek the belted hunter blew
  His wreathed bugle-horn. [9]

  One seem'd all dark and red--a tract of sand,
  And some one pacing there alone,
  Who paced for ever in a glimmering land,
  Lit with a low large moon. [10]

  One show'd an iron coast and angry waves.
  You seem'd to hear them climb and fall
  And roar rock-thwarted under bellowing caves,
  Beneath the windy wall. [11]

  And one, a full-fed river winding slow
  By herds upon an endless plain,
  The ragged rims of thunder brooding low,
  With shadow-streaks of rain. [11]

  And one, the reapers at their sultry toil.
  In front they bound the sheaves.
  Behind Were realms of upland, prodigal in oil,
  And hoary to the wind. [11]

  And one, a foreground black with stones and slags,
  Beyond, a line of heights, and higher
  All barr'd with long white cloud the scornful crags,
  And highest, snow and fire. [12]

  And one, an English home--gray twilight pour'd
  On dewy pastures, dewy trees,
  Softer than sleep--all things in order stored,
  A haunt of ancient Peace. [13]

  Nor these alone, but every landscape fair,
  As fit for every mood of mind,
  Or gay, or grave, or sweet, or stern, was there,
  Not less than truth design'd. [14]

  *          *          *          *

  Or the maid-mother by a crucifix,
  In tracts of pasture sunny-warm,
  Beneath branch-work of costly sardonyx
  Sat smiling, babe in arm. [15]

  Or in a clear-wall'd city on the sea,
  Near gilded organ-pipes, her hair
  Wound with white roses, slept St. Cecily;
  An angel look'd at her.

  Or thronging all one porch of Paradise,
  A group of Houris bow'd to see
  The dying Islamite, with hands and eyes
  That said, We wait for thee. [16]

  Or mythic Uther's deeply-wounded son
  In some fair space of sloping greens
  Lay, dozing in the vale of Avalon,
  And watch'd by weeping queens. [17]

  Or hollowing one hand against his ear,
  To list a foot-fall, ere he saw
  The wood-nymph, stay'd the Ausonian king to hear
  Of wisdom and of law. [18]

  Or over hills with peaky tops engrail'd,
  And many a tract of palm and rice,
  The throne of Indian Cama [19] slowly sail'd
  A summer fann'd with spice.

  Or sweet Europa's [20] mantle blew unclasp'd,
  From off her shoulder backward borne:
  From one hand droop'd a crocus: one hand grasp'd
  The mild bull's golden horn. [21]

  Or else flush'd Ganymede, his rosy thigh
  Half-buried in the Eagle's down,
  Sole as a flying star shot thro' the sky
  Above [22] the pillar'd town.

  Nor [23] these alone: but every [24] legend fair
  Which the supreme Caucasian mind [25]
  Carved out of Nature for itself, was there,
  Not less than life, design'd. [26]

   *       *       *       *

  Then in the towers I placed great bells that swung,
  Moved of themselves, with silver sound;
  And with choice paintings of wise men I hung
  The royal dais round.

  For there was Milton like a seraph strong,
  Beside him Shakespeare bland and mild;
  And there the world-worn Dante grasp'd his song,
  And somewhat grimly smiled. [27]

  And there the Ionian father of the rest; [28]
  A million wrinkles carved his skin;
  A hundred winters snow'd upon his breast,
  From cheek and throat and chin. [29]

  Above, the fair hall-ceiling stately set
  Many an arch high up did lift,
  And angels rising and descending met
  With interchange of gift. [29]

  Below was all mosaic choicely plann'd
  With cycles of the human tale
  Of this wide world, the times of every land
  So wrought, they will not fail. [29]

  The people here, a beast of burden slow,
  Toil'd onward, prick'd with goads and stings;
  Here play'd, a tiger, rolling to and fro
  The heads and crowns of kings; [29]

  Here rose, an athlete, strong to break or bind
  All force in bonds that might endure,
  And here once more like some sick man declined,
  And trusted any cure. [29]

  But over these she trod: and those great bells
  Began to chime. She took her throne:
  She sat betwixt the shining Oriels,
  To sing her songs alone. [29]

  And thro' the topmost Oriels' colour'd flame
  Two godlike faces gazed below;
  Plato the wise, and large-brow'd Verulam,
  The first of those who know. [29]

  And all those names, that in their motion were
  Full-welling fountain-heads of change,
  Betwixt the slender shafts were blazon'd fair
  In diverse raiment strange: [30]

  Thro' which the lights, rose, amber, emerald, blue,
  Flush'd in her temples and her eyes,
  And from her lips, as morn from Memnon, [31] drew
  Rivers of melodies.

  No nightingale delighteth to prolong
  Her low preamble all alone,
  More than my soul to hear her echo'd song
  Throb thro' the ribbed stone;

  Singing and murmuring in her feastful mirth,
  Joying to feel herself alive,
  Lord over Nature, Lord of [32] the visible earth,
  Lord of the senses five;

  Communing with herself: "All these are mine,
  And let the world have peace or wars,
  Tis one to me". She--when young night divine
  Crown'd dying day with stars,

  Making sweet close of his delicious toils--
  Lit light in wreaths and anadems,
  And pure quintessences of precious oils
  In hollow'd moons of gems,

  To mimic heaven; and clapt her hands and cried,
  "I marvel if my still delight
  In this great house so royal-rich, and wide,
  Be flatter'd to the height. [33]

  "O all things fair to sate my various eyes!
  O shapes and hues that please me well!
  O silent faces of the Great and Wise,
  My Gods, with whom I dwell! [34]

  "O God-like isolation which art mine,
  I can but count thee perfect gain,
  What time I watch the darkening droves of swine
  That range on yonder plain. [34]

  "In filthy sloughs they roll a prurient skin,
  They graze and wallow, breed and sleep;
  And oft some brainless devil enters in,
  And drives them to the deep." [34]

  Then of the moral instinct would she prate,
  And of the rising from the dead,
  As hers by right of full-accomplish'd Fate;
  And at the last she said:

  "I take possession of man's mind and deed.
  I care not what the sects may brawl,
  I sit as God holding no form of creed,
  But contemplating all." [35]

      *          *          *

  Full oft [36] the riddle of the painful earth
  Flash'd thro' her as she sat alone,
  Yet not the less held she her solemn mirth,
  And intellectual throne.

  And so she throve and prosper'd: so three years
  She prosper'd: on the fourth she fell, [37]
  Like Herod, [38] when the shout was in his ears,
  Struck thro' with pangs of hell.

  Lest she should fail and perish utterly,
  God, before whom ever lie bare
  The abysmal deeps of Personality, [39]
  Plagued her with sore despair.

  When she would think, where'er she turn'd her sight,
  The airy hand confusion wrought,
  Wrote "Mene, mene," and divided quite
  The kingdom of her thought. [40]

  Deep dread and loathing of her solitude
  Fell on her, from which mood was born
  Scorn of herself; again, from out that mood
  Laughter at her self-scorn. [41]

  "What! is not this my place of strength," she said,
  "My spacious mansion built for me,
  Whereof the strong foundation-stones were laid
  Since my first memory?"

  But in dark corners of her palace stood
  Uncertain shapes; and unawares
  On white-eyed phantasms weeping tears of blood,
  And horrible nightmares,

  And hollow shades enclosing hearts of flame,
  And, with dim fretted foreheads all,
  On corpses three-months-old at noon she came,
  That stood against the wall.

  A spot of dull stagnation, without light
  Or power of movement, seem'd my soul,
  'Mid onward-sloping [42] motions infinite
  Making for one sure goal.

  A still salt pool, lock'd in with bars of sand;
  Left on the shore; that hears all night
  The plunging seas draw backward from the land
  Their moon-led waters white.

  A star that with the choral starry dance
  Join'd not, but stood, and standing saw
  The hollow orb of moving Circumstance
  Roll'd round by one fix'd law.

  Back on herself her serpent pride had curl'd.
  "No voice," she shriek'd in that lone hall,
  "No voice breaks thro' the stillness of this world:
  One deep, deep silence all!"

  She, mouldering with the dull earth's mouldering sod,
  Inwrapt tenfold in slothful shame,
  Lay there exiled from eternal God,
  Lost to her place and name;

  And death and life she hated equally,
  And nothing saw, for her despair,
  But dreadful time, dreadful eternity,
  No comfort anywhere;

  Remaining utterly confused with fears,
  And ever worse with growing time,
  And ever unrelieved by dismal tears,
  And all alone in crime:

  Shut up as in a crumbling tomb, girt round
  With blackness as a solid wall,
  Far off she seem'd to hear the dully sound
  Of human footsteps fall.

  As in strange lands a traveller walking slow,
  In doubt and great perplexity,
  A little before moon-rise hears the low
  Moan of an unknown sea;

  And knows not if it be thunder or a sound
  Of rocks [43] thrown down, or one deep cry
  Of great wild beasts; then thinketh, "I have found
  A new land, but I die".

  She howl'd aloud, "I am on fire within.
  There comes no murmur of reply.
  What is it that will take away my sin,
  And save me lest I die?"

  So when four years were wholly finished,
  She threw her royal robes away.
  "Make me a cottage in the vale," she said,
  "Where I may mourn and pray. [44]

  "Yet pull not down my palace towers, that are
  So lightly, beautifully built:
  Perchance I may return with others there
  When I have purged my guilt." [45]

  From great broad meadow bases of deep grass.]

[Footnote 3: "The shadow of Saturn thrown upon the bright ring that
surrounds the planet appears motionless, though the body of the planet
revolves. Saturn rotates on its axis in the short period of ten and a
half hours, but the shadow of this swiftly whirling mass shows no more
motion than is seen in the shadow of a top spinning so rapidly that it
seems to be standing still." Rowe and Webb's note, which I gladly
borrow.]

[Footnote 4: 1833 and 1842. Steadfast.]

[Footnote 5: After this stanza in 1833 this, deleted in 1842:--

  "And richly feast within thy palace hall,
  Like to the dainty bird that sups,
  Lodged in the lustrous crown-imperial,
  Draining the honey cups."]


[Footnote 6: In 1833 these eight stanzas were inserted after the stanza
beginning, "I take possession of men's minds and deeds"; in 1842 they
were transferred, greatly altered, to their present position. For the
alterations on them see 'infra.']

[Footnote 7: 1833.

  Looking all ways, fitted to every mood.]


[Footnote 9: Here in 1833 was inserted the stanza, "One showed an
English home," afterwards transferred to its present position 85-88.]

[Footnote 10: 1833.

  Some were all dark and red, a glimmering land
  Lit with a low round moon,
  Among brown rocks a man upon the sand
  Went weeping all alone.]


[Footnote 11: These three stanzas were added in 1842.]

[Footnote 12: Thus in 1833:--

  One seemed a foreground black with stones and slags,
  Below sun-smitten icy spires
  Rose striped with long white cloud the scornful crags,
  Deep trenched with thunder fires.]


[Footnote 13: Not inserted here in 1833, but the following in its
place:--

  Some showed far-off thick woods mounted with towers,
  Nearer, a flood of mild sunshine
  Poured on long walks and lawns and beds and bowers
  Trellised with bunchy vine.]

[Footnote 14: Inserted in 1842.]


[Footnote 15: Thus in 1833, followed by the note:--

  Or the maid-mother by a crucifix,
  In yellow pastures sunny-warm,
  Beneath branch-work of costly sardonyx,
  Sat smiling, babe in arm.


When I first conceived the plan of the Palace of Art, I intended to
have introduced both sculptures and paintings into it; but it is the
most difficult of all things to 'devise' a statue in verse. Judge
whether I have succeeded in the statues of Elijah and Olympias.


  One was the Tishbite whom the raven fed,
  As when he stood on Carmel steeps,
  With one arm stretched out bare, and mocked and said,
  "Come cry aloud-he sleeps".

  Tall, eager, lean and strong, his cloak wind-borne
  Behind, his forehead heavenly bright
  From the clear marble pouring glorious scorn,
  Lit as with inner light.

  One, was Olympias: the floating snake
  Rolled round her ancles, round her waist
  Knotted, and folded once about her neck,
  Her perfect lips to taste.

  Round by the shoulder moved: she seeming blythe
  Declined her head: on every side
  The dragon's curves melted and mingled with
  The woman's youthful pride
  Of rounded limbs.

  Or Venus in a snowy shell alone,
  Deep-shadowed in the glassy brine,
  Moonlike glowed double on the blue, and shone
  A naked shape divine.]


[Footnote 16: Inserted in 1842.]

[Footnote 17: Thus in 1833:--

  Or that deep-wounded child of Pendragon
  Mid misty woods on sloping greens
  Dozed in the valley of Avilion,
  Tended by crowned queens.

The present reading is that of 1842. The reference is, of course, to
King Arthur, the supposed son of Uther Pendragon.

In 1833 the following stanza, excised in 1842, followed:--

  Or blue-eyed Kriemhilt from a craggy hold,
  Athwart the light-green rows of vine,
  Poured blazing hoards of Nibelungen gold,
  Down to the gulfy Rhine.]


[Footnote 18: Inserted in 1842 thus:--

  Or hollowing one hand against his ear,
  To listen for a footfall, ere he saw
  The wood-nymph, stay'd the Tuscan king to hear
  Of wisdom and of law.

List a footfall, 1843. Ausonian for Tuscan, 1850. The reference is to
Egeria and Numa Pompilius. 'Cf.' Juvenal, iii., 11-18:--

  Hic ubi nocturnae
  Numa constituebat amicae
  ...
  In vallem AEgeriae descendimus et speluneas
  Dissimiles veris.

and the beautiful passage in Byron's 'Childe Harold', iv., st.
cxv.-cxix.]


[Footnote 19: This is Camadev or Camadeo, the Cupid or God of Love of the
Hindu mythology.]

[Footnote 20: This picture of Europa seems to have been suggested by
Moschus, 'Idyll', ii., 121-5:--

  [Greek: Hae d' ar ephezomenae Zaenos Boeois epi n_otois tae men echen
  taurou dolichon keras, en cheri d' allae eirue porphyreas kolpou
  ptuchas.]

  "Then, seated on the back of the divine bull, with one hand did she
  grasp the bull's long horn and with the other she was catching up the
  purple folds of her garment, and the robe on her shoulders was swelled
  out."

See, too, the beautiful picture of the same scene in Achilles
Tatius, 'Clitophon and Leucippe', lib. i., 'ad init.;' and in Politian's
finely picturesque poem.]


[Footnote 21: In 1833 thus:--

  Europa's scarf blew in an arch, unclasped,
  From her bare shoulder backward borne.

Off inserted in 1842. Here in 1833 follows a stanza, excised in 1842:--

  He thro' the streaming crystal swam, and rolled
  Ambrosial breaths that seemed to float
  In light-wreathed curls. She from the ripple cold
  Updrew her sandalled foot.]


[Footnote 22: 1833. Over.]

[Footnote 23: 1833. Not.]

[Footnote 24: 1833. Many a.]

[Footnote 25: The Caucasian range forms the north-west margin of the
great tableland of Western Asia, and as it was the home of those races
who afterwards peopled Europe and Western Asia and so became the fathers
of civilisation and culture, the "Supreme Caucasian mind" is a
historically correct but certainly recondite expression for the
intellectual flower of the human race, for the perfection of human
ability.]


[Footnote 26: 1833. Broidered in screen and blind.

In the edition of 1833 appear the following stanzas, excised in 1842:--

  So that my soul beholding in her pride
  All these, from room to room did pass;
  And all things that she saw, she multiplied,
  A many-faced glass.

  And, being both the sower and the seed,
  Remaining in herself became
  All that she saw, Madonna, Ganymede,
  Or the Asiatic dame--

  Still changing, as a lighthouse in the night
  Changeth athwart the gleaming main,
  From red to yellow, yellow to pale white,
  Then back to red again.

  "From change to change four times within the womb
  The brain is moulded," she began,
  "So thro' all phases of all thought I come
  Into the perfect man.

  "All nature widens upward: evermore
  The simpler essence lower lies,
  More complex is more perfect, owning more
  Discourse, more widely wise.

  "I take possession of men's minds and deeds.
  I live in all things great and small.
  I dwell apart, holding no forms of creeds,
  But contemplating all."

  Four ample courts there were, East, West, South, North,
  In each a squared lawn where from
  A golden-gorged dragon spouted forth
  The fountain's diamond foam.

  All round the cool green courts there ran a row
  Of cloisters, branched like mighty woods,
  Echoing all night to that sonorous flow
  Of spouted fountain floods.

  From those four jets four currents in one swell
  Over the black rock streamed below
  In steamy folds, that, floating as they fell,
  Lit up a torrent bow.

  And round the roofs ran gilded galleries
  That gave large view to distant lands,
  Tall towns and mounds, and close beneath the skies
  Long lines of amber sands.

  Huge incense-urns along the balustrade,
  Hollowed of solid amethyst,
  Each with a different odour fuming, made
  The air a silver mist.

  Far-off 'twas wonderful to look upon
  Those sumptuous towers between the gleam
  Of that great foam-bow trembling in the sun,
  And the argent incense-steam;

  And round the terraces and round the walls,
  While day sank lower or rose higher,
  To see those rails with all their knobs and balls,
  Burn like a fringe of fire.

  Likewise the deepset windows, stained and traced.
  Burned, like slow-flaming crimson fires,
  From shadowed grots of arches interlaced,
  And topped with frostlike spires.]


[Footnote 27: 1833.

  There deep-haired Milton like an angel tall
  Stood limned, Shakspeare bland and mild,
  Grim Dante pressed his lips, and from the wall
  The bald blind Homer smiled.

Recast in its present form in
1842. After this stanza in 1833 appear the following stanzas, excised in
1842:--

  And underneath fresh carved in cedar wood,
  Somewhat alike in form and face,
  The Genii of every climate stood,
  All brothers of one race:

  Angels who sway the seasons by their art,
  And mould all shapes in earth and sea;
  And with great effort build the human heart
  From earliest infancy.

  And in the sun-pierced Oriels' coloured flame
  Immortal Michael Angelo
  Looked down, bold Luther, large-browed Verulam,
  The King of those who know. [A]

  Cervantes, the bright face of Calderon,
  Robed David touching holy strings,
  The Halicarnassean, and alone,
  Alfred the flower of kings.

  Isaiah with fierce Ezekiel,
  Swarth Moses by the Coptic sea,
  Plato, Petrarca, Livy, and Raphael,
  And eastern Confutzer.

    [Sub-Footnote A: Il maestro di color chi sanno.--Dante, 'Inf.',
    iii.]]


[Footnote 28: Homer. 'Cf.' Pope's 'Temple of Fame', 183-7:--

  Father of verse in holy fillets dress'd,
  His silver beard wav'd gently o'er his breast,
  Though blind a boldness in his looks appears,
  In years he seem'd but not impaired by years.]


[Footnote 29: All these stanzas were added in 1842. In 1833 appear the
following stanzas, excised in 1842:--

  As some rich tropic mountain, that infolds
  All change, from flats of scattered palms
  Sloping thro' five great zones of climate, holds
  His head in snows and calms--

  Full of her own delight and nothing else,
  My vain-glorious, gorgeous soul
  Sat throned between the shining oriels,
  In pomp beyond control;

  With piles of flavorous fruits in basket-twine
  Of gold, upheaped, crushing down
  Musk-scented blooms--all taste--grape, gourd or pine--
  In bunch, or single grown--

  Our growths, and such as brooding Indian heats
  Make out of crimson blossoms deep,
  Ambrosial pulps and juices, sweets from sweets
  Sun-changed, when sea-winds sleep.

  With graceful chalices of curious wine,
  Wonders of art--and costly jars,
  And bossed salvers. Ere young night divine
  Crowned dying day with stars,

  Making sweet close of his delicious toils,
  She lit white streams of dazzling gas,
  And soft and fragrant flames of precious oils
  In moons of purple glass

  Ranged on the fretted woodwork to the ground.
  Thus her intense untold delight,
  In deep or vivid colour, smell and sound,
  Was nattered day and night. [A]

    [Sub-Footnote A: If the poem were not already too long, I should
    have inserted in the text the following stanzas, expressive of the
    joy wherewith the soul contemplated the results of astronomical
    experiment. In the centre of the four quadrangles rose an immense
    tower.

    Hither, when all the deep unsounded skies
    Shuddered with silent stars she clomb,
    And as with optic glasses her keen eyes
    Pierced thro' the mystic dome,

    Regions of lucid matter taking forms,
    Brushes of fire, hazy gleams,
    Clusters and beds of worlds, and bee-like swarms
    Of suns, and starry streams.

    She saw the snowy poles of moonless Mars,
    That marvellous round of milky light
    Below Orion, and those double stars
    Whereof the one more bright

    Is circled by the other, etc.]



[Footnote 30: Thus in 1833:--

  And many more, that in their lifetime were
  Full-welling fountain heads of change,
  Between the stone shafts glimmered, blazoned fair
  In divers raiment strange.]

[Footnote 31: The statue of Memnon near Thebes in Egypt when first
struck by the rays of the rising sun is said to have become vocal, to
have emitted responsive sounds. See for an account of this 'Pausanias',
i., 42; Tacitus, 'Annals', ii., 61; and Juvenal, 'Sat.', xv., 5:

  "Dimidio magicae resonant ubi Memnone Chordae,"

and compare Akenside's verses,

  Old Memnon's image, long renown'd
  By fabling Nilus: to the quivering touch
  Of Titan's ray, with each repulsive string
  Consenting, sounded thro' the warbling air
  Unbidden strains.]


[Footnote 32: 1833. O'.]

[Footnote 33: Here added in 1842 and remaining till 1851 when they were
excised are two stanzas:--

  "From shape to shape at first within the womb
  The brain is modell'd," she began,
  "And thro' all phases of all thought I come
  Into the perfect man.

  "All nature widens upward. Evermore
  The simpler essence lower lies:
  More complex is more perfect, owning more
  Discourse, more widely wise."]


[Footnote 34: These stanzas were added in 1851.]

[Footnote 35: Added in
1842, with the following variants which remained till 1851, when the
present text was substituted:--

  "I take possession of men's minds and deeds.
  I live in all things great and small.
  I sit apart holding no forms of creeds,
  But contemplating all."]


[Footnote 36: 1833. Sometimes.]

[Footnote 37:

'abused' and their purpose and scope mistaken, there is no reason

LADY CLARA VERE DE VERE

Though this is placed among the poems published in 1833 it first
appeared in print in 1842. The subsequent alterations were very slight,
and after 1848 none at all were made.

  Lady Clara Vere de Vere,
  Of me you shall not win renown:
  You thought to break a country heart
  For pastime, ere you went to town.
  At me you smiled, but unbeguiled
  I saw the snare, and I retired:
  The daughter of a hundred Earls,
  You are not one to be desired.

  Lady Clara Vere de Vere,
  I know you proud to bear your name,
  Your pride is yet no mate for mine,
  Too proud to care from whence I came.
  Nor would I break for your sweet sake
  A heart that doats on truer charms.
  A simple maiden in her flower
  Is worth a hundred coats-of-arms.

  Lady Clara Vere de Vere,
  Some meeker pupil you must find,
  For were you queen of all that is,
  I could not stoop to such a mind.
  You sought to prove how I could love,
  And my disdain is my reply.
  The lion on your old stone gates
  Is not more cold to you than I.

  Lady Clara Vere de Vere,
  You put strange memories in my head.
  Not thrice your branching limes have blown
  Since I beheld young Laurence dead.
  Oh your sweet eyes, your low replies:
  A great enchantress you may be;
  But there was that across his throat
  Which you hardly cared to see.

  Lady Clara Vere de Vere,
  When thus he met his mother's view,
  She had the passions of her kind,
  She spake some certain truths of you.

  Indeed I heard one bitter word
  That scarce is fit for you to hear;
  Her manners had not that repose
  Which stamps the caste of Vere de Vere.

  Lady Clara Vere de Vere,
  There stands a spectre in your hall:
  The guilt of blood is at your door:
  You changed a wholesome heart to gall.
  You held your course without remorse,
  To make him trust his modest worth,
  And, last, you fix'd a vacant stare,
  And slew him with your noble birth.

  Trust me, Clara Vere de Vere,
  From yon blue heavens above us bent
  The grand old gardener and his wife [1]
  Smile at the claims of long descent.
  Howe'er it be, it seems to me,
  'Tis only noble to be good.
  Kind hearts are more than coronets,
  And simple faith than Norman blood.

  I know you, Clara Vere de Vere:
  You pine among your halls and towers:
  The languid light of your proud eyes
  Is wearied of the rolling hours.
  In glowing health, with boundless wealth,
  But sickening of a vague disease,
  You know so ill to deal with time,
  You needs must play such pranks as these.

  Clara, Clara Vere de Vere,
  If Time be heavy on your hands,
  Are there no beggars at your gate,
  Nor any poor about your lands?
  Oh! teach the orphan-boy to read,
  Or teach the orphan-girl to sew,
  Pray Heaven for a human heart,
  And let the foolish yoeman go.


[Footnote 1: 1842 and 1843. "The gardener Adam and his wife." In 1845 it
was altered to the present text.]






THE MAY QUEEN

The first two parts were first published in 1833.

The scenery is typical of Lincolnshire; in Fitzgerald's phrase, it is
all Lincolnshire inland, as 'Locksley Hall' is seaboard.

  You must wake and call me early, call me early, mother dear;
  To-morrow 'ill be the happiest time of all the glad [1] New-year;
  Of all the glad New-year, mother, the maddest merriest day;
  For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.

  There's many a black, black eye, they say, but none so bright as mine;
  There's Margaret and Mary, there's Kate and Caroline:
  But none so fair as little Alice in all the land they say,
  So I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.

  I sleep so sound all night, mother, that I shall never wake,
  If you [2] do not call me loud when the day begins to break:
  But I must gather knots of flowers, and buds and garlands gay,
  For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.

  As I came up the valley whom think ye should I see,
  But Robin [3] leaning on the bridge beneath the hazel-tree?
  He thought of that sharp look, mother, I gave him yesterday,--
  But I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.

  He thought I was a ghost, mother, for I was all in white,
  And I ran by him without speaking, like a flash of light.
  They call me cruel-hearted, but I care not what they say,
  For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.

  They say he's dying all for love, but that can never be:
  They say his heart is breaking, mother--what is that to me?
  There's many a bolder lad 'ill woo me any summer day,
  And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.

  Little Effie shall go with me to-morrow to the green,
  And you'll be there, too, mother, to see me made the Queen;
  For the shepherd lads on every side 'ill come from far away,
  And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.

  The honeysuckle round the porch has wov'n its wavy bowers,
  And by the meadow-trenches blow the faint sweet cuckoo-flowers;
  And the wild marsh-marigold shines like fire in swamps and hollows gray,
  And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.

  The night-winds come and go, mother, upon the meadow-grass,
  And the happy stars above them seem to brighten as they pass;
  There will not be a drop of rain the whole of the live-long day,
  And I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.

  All the valley, mother, 'ill be fresh and green and still,
  And the cowslip and the crowfoot are over all the hill,
  And the rivulet in the flowery dale 'ill merrily glance and play,
  For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.

  So you must wake and call me early, call me early, mother dear,
  To-morrow 'ill be the happiest time of all the glad New-year:
  To-morrow 'ill be of all the year the maddest merriest day,
  For I'm to be Queen o' the May, mother, I'm to be Queen o' the May.

NEW-YEAR'S EVE

  If you're waking call me early, call me early, mother dear,
  For I would see the sun rise upon the glad New-year.
  It is the last New-year that I shall ever see,
  Then you may lay me low i' the mould and think no more of me.

  To-night I saw the sun set: he set and left behind
  The good old year, the dear old time, and all my peace of mind;
  And the New-year's coming up, mother, but I shall never see
  The blossom on [1] the blackthorn, the leaf upon the tree.

  Last May we made a crown of flowers: we had a merry day;
  Beneath the hawthorn on the green they made me Queen of May;
  And we danced about the may-pole and in the hazel copse,
  Till Charles's Wain came out above the tall white chimney-tops.

  There's not a flower on all the hills: the frost is on the pane:
  I only wish to live till the snowdrops come again:
  I wish the snow would melt and the sun come out on high:
  I long to see a flower so before the day I die.

  The building rook'll caw from the windy tall elm-tree,
  And the tufted plover pipe along the fallow lea,
  And the swallow'll come back again with summer o'er the wave.
  But I shall lie alone, mother, within the mouldering grave.

  Upon the chancel-casement, and upon that grave of mine,
  In the early, early morning the summer sun'll shine,
  Before the red cock crows from the farm upon the hill,
  When you are warm-asleep, mother, and all the world is still.

  When the flowers come again, mother, beneath the waning light
  You'll never see me more in the long gray fields at night;
  When from the dry dark wold the summer airs blow cool
  On the oat-grass and the sword-grass, and the bulrush in the pool.

  You'll bury me, [2] my mother, just beneath the hawthorn shade,
  And you'll come [3] sometimes and see me where I am lowly laid.
  I shall not forget you, mother, I shall hear you when you pass,[4]
  With your feet above my head in the long and pleasant grass.

  I have been wild and wayward, but you'll forgive [5] me now;
  You'll kiss me, my own mother, and forgive me ere I go; [6]
  Nay, nay, you must not weep, [7] nor let your grief be wild,
  You should not fret for me, mother, you [8] have another child.

  If I can I'll come again, mother, from out my resting-place;
  Tho' you'll [9] not see me, mother, I shall look upon your face;
  Tho' I cannot speak a word, 1 shall harken what you [10] say,
  And be often, often with you when you think [11] I'm far away.

  Good-night, good-night, when I have said good-night for evermore,
  And you [12] see me carried out from the threshold of the door;
  Don't let Effie come to see me till my grave be growing green:
  She'll be a better child to you than ever I have been.

  She'll find my garden-tools upon the granary floor:
  Let her take 'em: they are hers: I shall never garden more:
  But tell her, when I'm gone, to train the rose-bush that I set
  About the parlour-window and the box of mignonette.

  Good-night, sweet mother: call me before the day is born. [13]
  All night I lie awake, but I fall asleep at morn;
  But I would see the sun rise upon the glad New-year,
  So, if your waking, call me, call me early, mother dear.

CONCLUSION

Added in 1842.

  I thought to pass away before, and yet alive I am;
  And in the fields all round I hear the bleating of the lamb.
  How sadly, I remember, rose the morning of the year!
  To die before the snowdrop came, and now the violet's here.

  O sweet is the new violet, that comes beneath the skies,
  And sweeter is the young lamb's voice to me that cannot rise,
  And sweet is all the land about, and all the flowers that blow,
  And sweeter far is death than life to me that long to go.

  It seem'd so hard at first, mother, to leave the blessed sun,
  And now it seems as hard to stay, and yet His will be done!
  But still I think it can't be long before I find release;
  And that good man, the clergyman, has told me words of peace. [1]

  O blessings on his kindly voice and on his silver hair!
  And blessings on his whole life long, until he meet me there!
  O blessings on his kindly heart and on his silver head!
  A thousand times I blest him, as he knelt beside my bed.

  He taught me all the mercy, for he show'd [2] me all the sin.
  Now, tho' my lamp was lighted late, there's One will let me in:
  Nor would I now be well, mother, again, if that could be,
  For my desire is but to pass to Him that died for me.

  I did not hear the dog howl, mother, or the death-watch beat,
  There came a sweeter token when the night and morning meet:
  But sit beside my bed, mother, and put your hand in mine,
  And Effie on the other side, and I will tell the sign.

  All in the wild March-morning I heard the angels call;
  It was when the moon was setting, and the dark was over all;
  The trees began to whisper, and the wind began to roll,
  And in the wild March-morning I heard them call my soul.

  For lying broad awake I thought of you and Effie dear;
  I saw you sitting in the house, and I no longer here;
  With all my strength I pray'd for both, and so I felt resign'd,
  And up the valley came a swell of music on the wind.

  I thought that it was fancy, and I listen'd in my bed,
  And then did something speak to me--I know not what was said;
  For great delight and shuddering took hold of all my mind,
  And up the valley came again the music on the wind.

  But you were sleeping; and I said, "It's not for them: it's mine".
  And if it comes [3] three times, I thought, I take it for a sign.
  And once again it came, and close beside the window-bars,
  Then seem'd to go right up to Heaven and die among the stars.

  So now I think my time is near. I trust it is. I know
  The blessed music went that way my soul will have to go.
  And for myself, indeed, I care not if I go to-day.
  But, Effie, you must comfort _her_ when I am past away.

  And say to Robin [4] a kind word, and tell him not to fret;
  There's many worthier than I, would make him happy yet.
  If I had lived--I cannot tell--I might have been his wife;
  But all these things have ceased to be, with my desire of life.

  O look! the sun begins to rise, the heavens are in a glow;
  He shines upon a hundred fields, and all of them I know.
  And there I move no longer now, and there his light may shine--
  Wild flowers in the valley for other hands than mine.

  O sweet and strange it seems to me, that ere this day is done
  The voice, that now is speaking, may be beyond the sun--
  For ever and for ever with those just souls and true--
  And what is life, that we should moan? why make we such ado?

  For ever and for ever, all in a blessed home--
  And there to wait a little while till you and Effie come--
  To lie within the light of God, as I lie upon your breast--
  And the wicked cease from troubling, and the weary are at rest.

  And that good man, the clergyman, he preaches words of peace.

THE LOTOS-EATERS

First published in 1833, but when republished in 1842 the alterations in
the way of excision, alteration, and addition were very extensive. The
text of 1842 is practically the final text. This charming poem is
founded on 'Odyssey', ix., 82 'seq.'

  "On the tenth day we set foot on the land of the lotos-eaters who eat
  a flowery food. So we stepped ashore and drew water... When we had
  tasted meat and drink I sent forth certain of my company to go and
  make search what manner of men they were who here live upon the earth
  by bread... Then straightway they went and mixed with the men of the
  lotos-eaters, and so it was that the lotos-eaters devised not death
  for our fellows but gave them of the lotos to taste. Now whosoever of
  them did eat the honey-sweet fruit of the lotos had no more wish to
  bring tidings nor to come back, but there he chose to abide with the
  lotos-eating men ever feeding on the lotos and forgetful of his
  homeward way. Therefore I led them back to the ships weeping and sore
  against their will ... lest haply any should eat of the lotos and be
  forgetful of returning."

  (Lang and Butcher's translation.)

But in the details of his poem Tennyson has laid many other poets under
contribution, notably Moschus, 'Idyll', v.; Bion, 'Idyll', v.; Spenser,
'Faerie Queen', II. vi. (description of the 'Idle Lake'), and Thomson's
'Castle of Indolence'.


  "Courage!" he said, and pointed toward the land,
  "This mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon."
  In the afternoon they came unto a land,
  In which it seemed always afternoon.
  All round the coast the languid air did swoon,
  Breathing like one that hath a weary dream.
  Full-faced above the valley stood the moon; [1]
  And like a downward smoke, the slender stream
  Along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem.

  A land of streams! some, like a downward smoke,
  Slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn, did go;
  And some thro' wavering lights and shadows broke,
  Rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below.
  They saw the gleaming river seaward flow [2]
  From the inner land: far off, three mountain-tops,
  Three silent pinnacles of aged snow, [3]
  Stood sunset-flush'd: and, dew'd with showery drops,
  Up-clomb the shadowy pine above the woven copse.

  The charmed sunset linger'd low adown
  In the red West: thro' mountain clefts the dale
  Was seen far inland, and the yellow down
  Border'd with palm, and many a winding vale
  And meadow, set with slender galingale;
  A land where all things always seem'd the same!
  And round about the keel with faces pale,
  Dark faces pale against that rosy flame,
  The mild-eyed melancholy Lotos-eaters came.

  Branches they bore of that enchanted stem,
  Laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave
  To each, but whoso did receive of them,
  And taste, to him the gushing of the wave
  Far far away did seem to mourn and rave
  On alien shores; and if his fellow spake,
  His voice was thin, as voices from the grave;
  And deep-asleep he seem'd, yet all awake,
  And music in his ears his beating heart did make.

  They sat them down upon the yellow sand,
  Between the sun and moon upon the shore;
  And sweet it was to dream of Father-land,
  Of child, and wife, and slave; but evermore
  Most weary seem'd the sea, weary the oar,
  Weary the wandering fields of barren foam.
  Then some one said, "We will return no more";
  And all at once they sang, "Our island home
  Is far beyond the wave; we will no longer roam".

  CHORIC SONG

  1

    There is sweet music here that softer falls
    Than petals from blown roses on the grass,
    Or night-dews on still waters between walls
    Of shadowy granite, in a gleaming pass;
    Music that gentlier on the spirit lies,
    Than tir'd eyelids upon tir'd eyes;
    Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies.
    Here are cool mosses deep,
    And thro' the moss the ivies creep,
    And in the stream the long-leaved flowers weep,
    And from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in sleep.


  2

    Why are we weigh'd upon with heaviness,
    And utterly consumed with sharp distress,
    While all things else have rest from weariness?
    All things have rest: why should we toil alone,
    We only toil, who are the first of things,
    And make perpetual moan,
    Still from one sorrow to another thrown:
    Nor ever fold our wings,
    And cease from wanderings,
    Nor steep our brows in slumber's holy balm;
    Nor harken what the inner spirit sings,
    "There is no joy but calm!"
    Why should we only toil, the roof and crown of things?


  3

    Lo! in the middle of the wood,
    The folded leaf is woo'd from out the bud
    With winds upon the branch, and there
    Grows green and broad, and takes no care,
    Sun-steep'd at noon, and in the moon
    Nightly dew-fed; and turning yellow
    Falls, and floats adown the air.
    Lo! sweeten'd with the summer light,
    The full-juiced apple, waxing over-mellow,
    Drops in a silent autumn night.
    All its allotted length of days,
    The flower ripens in its place,
    Ripens and fades, and falls, and hath no toil,
    Fast-rooted in the fruitful soil.


  4

    Hateful is the dark-blue sky,
    Vaulted o'er the dark-blue sea. [1]
    Death is the end of life; ah, why
    Should life all labour be?
    Let us alone.
    Time driveth onward fast,
    And in a little while our lips are dumb.
    Let us alone.
    What is it that will last?
    All things are taken from us, and become
    Portions and parcels of the dreadful Past.
    Let us alone.
    What pleasure can we have
    To war with evil? Is there any peace
    In ever climbing up the climbing wave? [2]
    All things have rest, and ripen toward the grave [3]
    In silence; ripen, fall and cease:
    Give us long rest or death, dark death, or dreamful ease.


  5

    How sweet it were, hearing the downward stream,
    With half-shut eyes ever to seem
    Falling asleep in a half-dream!
    To dream and dream, like yonder amber light,
    Which will not leave the myrrh-bush on the height;
    To hear each other's whisper'd speech:
    Eating the Lotos day by day,
    To watch the crisping ripples on the beach,
    And tender curving lines of creamy spray;
    To lend our hearts and spirits wholly
    To the influence of mild-minded melancholy;
    To muse and brood and live again in memory,
    With those [4] old faces of our infancy
    Heap'd over with a mound of grass,
    Two handfuls of white dust, shut in an urn of brass!


  6

    Dear is the memory of our wedded lives,
    And dear the last embraces of our wives
    And their warm tears: but all hath suffer'd change;
    For surely now our household hearths are cold:
    Our sons inherit us: our looks are strange:
    And we should come like ghosts to trouble joy.
    Or else the island princes over-bold
    Have eat our substance, and the minstrel sings
    Before them of the ten-years' war in Troy,
    And our great deeds, as half-forgotten things.
    Is there confusion in the little isle? [5]
    Let what is broken so remain.
    The Gods are hard to reconcile:
    'Tis hard to settle order once again.
    There 'is' confusion worse than death,
    Trouble on trouble, pain on pain,
    Long labour unto aged breath,
    Sore task to hearts worn out with [6] many wars
    And eyes grow dim with gazing on the pilot-stars.[7]


  7

    But, propt on beds [8] of amaranth and moly,
    How sweet (while warm airs lull us, blowing lowly)
    With half-dropt eyelids still,
    Beneath a heaven dark and holy,
    To watch the long bright river drawing slowly
    His waters from the purple hill--
    To hear the dewy echoes calling
    From cave to cave thro' the thick-twined vine--
    To watch [9] the emerald-colour'd water falling
    Thro' many a wov'n acanthus-wreath divine!
    Only to hear and see the far-off sparkling brine,
    Only to hear were sweet, stretch'd out beneath the pine.


  8

    The Lotos blooms below the barren peak: [9]
    The Lotos blows by every winding creek:
    All day the wind breathes low with mellower tone:
    Thro' every hollow cave and alley lone
    Round and round the spicy downs the yellow Lotos-dust is blown.
    We have had enough of action, and of motion we,
    Roll'd to starboard, roll'd to larboard, when the surge was seething
      free,
    Where the wallowing monster spouted his foam-fountains in the sea.
    Let us swear an oath, and keep it with an equal mind,
    In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclined
    On the hills like Gods together, careless of mankind.
    For they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are hurl'd
    Far below them in the valleys, and the clouds are lightly curl'd
    Round their golden houses, girdled with the gleaming world:
    Where they smile in secret, looking over wasted lands,
    Blight and famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps and fiery
      sands,
    Clanging fights, and flaming towns, and sinking ships and praying
      hands.
    But they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful song
    Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong,
    Like a tale of little meaning tho' the words are strong;
    Chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil,
    Sow the seed, and reap the harvest with enduring toil,
    Storing yearly little dues of wheat, and wine and oil;
    Till they perish and they suffer--some,'tis whisper'd--down in hell
    Suffer endless anguish, others in Elysian valleys dwell,
    Resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel.
    Surely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore
    Than labour in the deep mid-ocean, wind and wave and oar;
    Oh rest ye, brother mariners, we will not wander more. [10]

and the present text substituted:--

  We have had enough of motion,
  Weariness and wild alarm,
  Tossing on the tossing ocean,
  Where the tusked sea-horse walloweth
  In a stripe of grass-green calm,
  At noontide beneath the lee;
  And the monstrous narwhale swalloweth
  His foam-fountains in the sea.
  Long enough the wine-dark wave our weary bark did carry.
  This is lovelier and sweeter,
  Men of Ithaca, this is meeter,
  In the hollow rosy vale to tarry,
  Like a dreamy Lotos-eater, a delirious Lotos-eater!
  We will eat the Lotos, sweet
  As the yellow honeycomb,
  In the valley some, and some
  On the ancient heights divine;
  And no more roam,
  On the loud hoar foam,
  To the melancholy home
  At the limit of the brine,
  The little isle of Ithaca, beneath the day's decline.
  We'll lift no more the shattered oar,
  No more unfurl the straining sail;
  With the blissful Lotos-eaters pale
  We will abide in the golden vale
  Of the Lotos-land till the Lotos fail;
  We will not wander more.
  Hark! how sweet the horned ewes bleat
  On the solitary steeps,
  And the merry lizard leaps,
  And the foam-white waters pour;
  And the dark pine weeps,
  And the lithe vine creeps,
  And the heavy melon sleeps
  On the level of the shore:
  Oh! islanders of Ithaca, we will not wander more,
  Surely, surely slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore
  Than labour in the ocean, and rowing with the oar,
  Oh! islanders of Ithaca, we will return no more.

The fine picture in the text of the gods of Epicurus was no doubt
immediately suggested by 'Lucretius', iii., 15 'seq.', while the
'Icaromenippus' of Lucian furnishes an excellent commentary on
Tennyson's picture of those gods and what they see. 'Cf.' too the Song
of the Parcae in Goethe's 'Iphigenie auf Tauris', iv., 5.]






A DREAM OF FAIR WOMEN

First published in 1833 but very extensively altered on its
republication in 1842. It had been written by June, 1832, and appears to
have been originally entitled 'Legend of Fair Women' (see Spedding's
letter dated 21st June, 1832, 'Life', i., 116). In nearly every edition
between 1833 and 1853 it was revised, and perhaps no poem proves more
strikingly the scrupulous care which Tennyson took to improve what he
thought susceptible of improvement. The work which inspired it,
Chaucer's 'Legend of Good Women', was written about 1384, thus
"preluding" by nearly two hundred years the "spacious times of great
Elizabeth". There is no resemblance between the poems beyond the fact
that both are visions and both have as their heroines illustrious women
who have been unfortunate. Cleopatra is the only one common to the two
poems. Tennyson's is an exquisite work of art--the transition from the
anarchy of dreams to the dreamland landscape and to the sharply denned
figures--the skill with which the heroines (what could be more perfect
that Cleopatra and Jephtha's daughter?) are chosen and contrasted--the
wonderful way in which the Iphigenia of Euripides and Lucretius and the
Cleopatra of Shakespeare are realised are alike admirable. The poem
opened in 1833 with the following strangely irrelevant verses, excised
in 1842, which as Fitzgerald observed "make a perfect poem by themselves
without affecting the 'dream '":--

    As when a man, that sails in a balloon,
    Downlooking sees the solid shining ground
    Stream from beneath him in the broad blue noon,
    Tilth, hamlet, mead and mound:

    And takes his flags and waves them to the mob,
    That shout below, all faces turned to where
    Glows ruby-like the far up crimson globe,
    Filled with a finer air:

    So lifted high, the Poet at his will
    Lets the great world flit from him, seeing all,
    Higher thro' secret splendours mounting still,
    Self-poised, nor fears to fall.



  Hearing apart the echoes of his fame.
  While I spoke thus, the seedsman, memory,
  Sowed my deepfurrowed thought with many a name,
  Whose glory will not die.

  I read, before my eyelids dropt their shade,
  "The Legend of Good Women," long ago
  Sung by the morning star [1] of song, who made
  His music heard below;

  Dan Chaucer, the first warbler, whose sweet breath
  Preluded those melodious bursts, that fill
  The spacious times of great Elizabeth
  With sounds that echo still.

  And, for a while, the knowledge of his art
  Held me above the subject, as strong gales
  Hold swollen clouds from raining, tho' my heart,
  Brimful of those wild tales,

  Charged both mine eyes with tears.
  In every land I saw, wherever light illumineth,
  Beauty and anguish walking hand in hand
  The downward slope to death. [2]

  Those far-renowned brides of ancient song
  Peopled the hollow dark, like burning stars,
  And I heard sounds of insult, shame, and wrong,
  And trumpets blown for wars;

  And clattering flints batter'd with clanging hoofs:
  And I saw crowds in column'd sanctuaries;
  And forms that pass'd [3] at windows and on roofs
  Of marble palaces;

  Corpses across the threshold; heroes tall
  Dislodging pinnacle and parapet
  Upon the tortoise creeping to the wall; [4]
  Lances in ambush set;

  And high shrine-doors burst thro' with heated blasts
  That run before the fluttering tongues of fire;
  White surf wind-scatter'd over sails and masts,
  And ever climbing higher;

  Squadrons and squares of men in brazen plates,
  Scaffolds, still sheets of water, divers woes,
  Ranges of glimmering vaults with iron grates,
  And hush'd seraglios.

  So shape chased shape as swift as, when to land
  Bluster the winds and tides the self-same way,
  Crisp foam-flakes scud along the level sand,
  Torn from the fringe of spray.

  I started once, or seem'd to start in pain,
  Resolved on noble things, and strove to speak,
  As when a great thought strikes along the brain,
  And flushes all the cheek.

  And once my arm was lifted to hew down,
  A cavalier from off his saddle-bow,
  That bore a lady from a leaguer'd town;
  And then, I know not how,

  All those sharp fancies, by down-lapsing thought
  Stream'd onward, lost their edges, and did creep
  Roll'd on each other, rounded, smooth'd and brought
  Into the gulfs of sleep.

  At last methought that I had wander'd far
  In an old wood: fresh-wash'd in coolest dew,
  The maiden splendours of the morning star
  Shook in the steadfast [5] blue.

  Enormous elmtree-boles did stoop and lean
  Upon the dusky brushwood underneath
  Their broad curved branches, fledged with clearest green,
  New from its silken sheath.

  The dim red morn had died, her journey done,
  And with dead lips smiled at the twilight plain,
  Half-fall'n across the threshold of the sun,
  Never to rise again.

  There was no motion in the dumb dead air,
  Not any song of bird or sound of rill;
  Gross darkness of the inner sepulchre
  Is not so deadly still

  As that wide forest.
  Growths of jasmine turn'd
  Their humid arms festooning tree to tree, [6]
  And at the root thro' lush green grasses burn'd
  The red anemone.

  I knew the flowers, I knew the leaves, I knew
  The tearful glimmer of the languid dawn
  On those long, rank, dark wood-walks, drench'd in dew,
  Leading from lawn to lawn.

  The smell of violets, hidden in the green,
  Pour'd back into my empty soul and frame
  The times when I remember to have been
  Joyful and free from blame.

  And from within me a clear under-tone
  Thrill'd thro' mine ears in that unblissful clime
  "Pass freely thro': the wood is all thine own,
  Until the end of time".

  At length I saw a lady [7] within call,
  Stiller than chisell'd marble, standing there;
  A daughter of the gods, divinely tall, [8]
  And most divinely fair.

  Her loveliness with shame and with surprise
  Froze my swift speech: she turning on my face
  The star-like sorrows of immortal eyes,
  Spoke slowly in her place.

  "I had great beauty: ask thou not my name:
  No one can be more wise than destiny.
  Many drew swords and died.
  Where'er I came I brought calamity."

  "No marvel, sovereign lady [9]: in fair field
  Myself for such a face had boldly died," [10]
  I answer'd free; and turning I appeal'd
  To one [11] that stood beside.

  But she, with sick and scornful looks averse,
  To her full height her stately stature draws;
  "My youth," she said, "was blasted with a curse:
  This woman was the cause.

  "I was cut off from hope in that sad place, [12]
  Which yet to name my spirit loathes and fears: [13]
  My father held his hand upon his face;
  I, blinded with my tears,

  "Still strove to speak: my voice was thick with sighs
  As in a dream. Dimly I could descry
  The stern black-bearded kings with wolfish eyes,
  Waiting to see me die.

  "The high masts flicker'd as they lay afloat;
  The crowds, the temples, waver'd, and the shore;
  The bright death quiver'd at the victim's throat;
  Touch'd; and I knew no more." [14]

  Whereto the other with a downward brow:
  "I would the white cold heavy-plunging foam, [15]
  Whirl'd by the wind, had roll'd me deep below,
  Then when I left my home."

  Her slow full words sank thro' the silence drear,
  As thunder-drops fall on a sleeping sea:
  Sudden I heard a voice that cried, "Come here,
  That I may look on thee".

  I turning saw, throned on a flowery rise,
  One sitting on a crimson scarf unroll'd;
  A queen, with swarthy cheeks [16] and bold black eyes,
  Brow-bound with burning gold.

  She, flashing forth a haughty smile, began:
  "I govern'd men by change, and so I sway'd
  All moods. Tis long since I have seen a man.
  Once, like the moon, I made

  "The ever-shifting currents of the blood
  According to my humour ebb and flow.
  I have no men to govern in this wood:
  That makes my only woe.

  "Nay--yet it chafes me that I could not bend
  One will; nor tame and tutor with mine eye
  That dull cold-blooded Caesar. Prythee, friend,
  Where is Mark Antony? [17]

  "The man, my lover, with whom I rode sublime
  On Fortune's neck: we sat as God by God:
  The Nilus would have risen before his time
  And flooded at our nod. [18]

  "We drank the Libyan [19] Sun to sleep, and lit
  Lamps which outburn'd Canopus. O my life In Egypt!
  O the dalliance and the wit,
  The flattery and the strife, [20]

  "And the wild kiss, when fresh from war's alarms, [21]
  My Hercules, my Roman Antony,
  My mailed Bacchus leapt into my arms,
  Contented there to die!

  "And there he died: and when I heard my name
  Sigh'd forth with life, I would not brook my fear [22]
  Of the other: with a worm I balk'd his fame.
  What else was left? look here!"

  (With that she tore her robe apart, and half
  The polish'd argent of her breast to sight
  Laid bare. Thereto she pointed with a laugh,
  Showing the aspick's bite.)

  "I died a Queen. The Roman soldier found [23]
  Me lying dead, my crown about my brows,
  A name for ever!--lying robed and crown'd,
  Worthy a Roman spouse."

  Her warbling voice, a lyre of widest range
  Struck [24] by all passion, did fall down and glance
  From tone to tone, and glided thro' all change
  Of liveliest utterance.

  When she made pause I knew not for delight;
  Because with sudden motion from the ground
  She raised her piercing orbs, and fill'd with light
  The interval of sound.

  Still with their fires Love tipt his keenest darts;
  As once they drew into two burning rings
  All beams of Love, melting the mighty hearts
  Of captains and of kings.

  Slowly my sense undazzled. Then I heard
  A noise of some one coming thro' the lawn,
  And singing clearer than the crested bird,
  That claps his wings at dawn.

  "The torrent brooks of hallow'd Israel
  From craggy hollows pouring, late and soon,
  Sound all night long, in falling thro' the dell,
  Far-heard beneath the moon.

  "The balmy moon of blessed Israel
  Floods all the deep-blue gloom with beams divine:
  All night the splinter'd crags that wall the dell
  With spires of silver shine."

  As one that museth where broad sunshine laves
  The lawn by some cathedral, thro' the door
  Hearing the holy organ rolling waves
  Of sound on roof and floor,

  Within, and anthem sung, is charm'd and tied
  To where he stands,--so stood I, when that flow
  Of music left the lips of her that died
  To save her father's vow;

  The daughter of the warrior Gileadite, [25]
  A maiden pure; as when she went along
  From Mizpeh's tower'd gate with welcome light,
  With timbrel and with song.

  My words leapt forth: "Heaven heads the count of crimes
  With that wild oath". She render'd answer high:
  "Not so, nor once alone; a thousand times
  I would be born and die.

  "Single I grew, like some green plant, whose root
  Creeps to the garden water-pipes beneath,
  Feeding the flower; but ere my flower to fruit
  Changed, I was ripe for death.

  "My God, my land, my father--these did move
  Me from my bliss of life, that Nature gave,
  Lower'd softly with a threefold cord of love
  Down to a silent grave.

  "And I went mourning, 'No fair Hebrew boy
  Shall smile away my maiden blame among
  The Hebrew mothers'--emptied of all joy,
  Leaving the dance and song,

  "Leaving the olive-gardens far below,
  Leaving the promise of my bridal bower,
  The valleys of grape-loaded vines that glow
  Beneath the battled tower

  "The light white cloud swam over us. Anon
  We heard the lion roaring from his den; [26]
  We saw the large white stars rise one by one,
  Or, from the darken'd glen,

  "Saw God divide the night with flying flame,
  And thunder on the everlasting hills.
  I heard Him, for He spake, and grief became
  A solemn scorn of ills.

  "When the next moon was roll'd into the sky,
  Strength came to me that equall'd my desire.
  How beautiful a thing it was to die
  For God and for my sire!

  "It comforts me in this one thought to dwell,
  That I subdued me to my father's will;
  Because the kiss he gave me, ere I fell,
  Sweetens the spirit still.

  "Moreover it is written that my race
  Hew'd Ammon, hip and thigh, from Aroer [27]
  On Arnon unto Minneth." Here her face
  Glow'd, as I look'd at her.

  She lock'd her lips: she left me where I stood:
  "Glory to God," she sang, and past afar,
  Thridding the sombre boskage of the wood,
  Toward the morning-star.

  Losing her carol I stood pensively,
  As one that from a casement leans his head,
  When midnight bells cease ringing suddenly,
  And the old year is dead.

  "Alas! alas!" a low voice, full of care,
  Murmur'd beside me: "Turn and look on me:
  I am that Rosamond, whom men call fair,
  If what I was I be.

  "Would I had been some maiden coarse and poor!
  O me, that I should ever see the light!
  Those dragon eyes of anger'd Eleanor
  Do haunt me, day and night."

  She ceased in tears, fallen from hope and trust:
  To whom the Egyptian: "O, you tamely died!
  You should have clung to Fulvia's waist, and thrust
  The dagger thro' her side".

  With that sharp sound the white dawn's creeping beams,
  Stol'n to my brain, dissolved the mystery
  Of folded sleep. The captain of my dreams
  Ruled in the eastern sky.

  Morn broaden'd on the borders of the dark,
  Ere I saw her, who clasp'd in her last trance
  Her murder'd father's head, or Joan of Arc, [28]
  A light of ancient France;

  Or her, who knew that Love can vanquish Death,
  Who kneeling, with one arm about her king,
  Drew forth the poison with her balmy breath, [29]
  Sweet as new buds in Spring.

  No memory labours longer from the deep
  Gold-mines of thought to lift the hidden ore
  That glimpses, moving up, than I from sleep
  To gather and tell o'er

  Each little sound and sight. With what dull pain
  Compass'd, how eagerly I sought to strike
  Into that wondrous track of dreams again!
  But no two dreams are like.

  As when a soul laments, which hath been blest,
  Desiring what is mingled with past years,
  In yearnings that can never be exprest
  By sighs or groans or tears;

  Because all words, tho' cull'd [30] with choicest art,
  Failing to give the bitter of the sweet,
  Wither beneath the palate, and the heart
  Faints, faded by its heat.

Death':--

[Footnote 2: Here follow in 1833 two stanzas excised in 1842:--

  In every land I thought that, more or less,
  The stronger sterner nature overbore
  The softer, uncontrolled by gentleness
  And selfish evermore:

  And whether there were any means whereby,
  In some far aftertime, the gentler mind
  Might reassume its just and full degree
  Of rule among mankind.]

[Footnote 7: A lady, i.e., Helen.]

[Footnote 8: Tennyson has here noticed what is so often emphasised by
Greek writers, that tallness was a great beauty in women. See Aristotle,
'Ethics', iv., 3, and Homer, 'passim, Odyssey', viii., 416;
xviii., 190 and 248; xxi., 6. So Xenophon in describing Panthea
emphasises her tallness, 'Cyroped.', v.]

[Footnote 11: The one is Iphigenia.]

[Footnote 12: Aulis.]

[Footnote 13: It was not till 1884 that this line was altered to the
reading of the final edition, 'i.e.', "Which men called Aulis in
those iron years". For the "iron years" of that reading 'cf.'
Thomson, 'Spring', 384, "'iron' times".]

[Footnote 14: From 1833 till 1853 this stanza ran:--

  "The tall masts quivered as they lay afloat,
  The temples and the people and the shore,
  One drew a sharp knife thro' my tender throat
  Slowly,--and nothing more".

It is curious that Tennyson should have allowed the last line to stand
so long; possibly it may have been to defy Lockhart's sarcastic
commentary: "What touching simplicity, what pathetic resignation--he cut
my throat, nothing more!" With Tennyson's picture should be compared
AEschylus, 'Agamem.', 225-49, and Lucretius, i., 85-100. For the bold and
picturesque substitution of the effect for the cause in the "bright
death quiver'd" 'cf.' Sophocles, 'Electra', 1395,

  [Greek: 'neakonaeton aima cheiroin ech_on,']

"with the newly-whetted blood on his hands". So "vulnus" is frequently
used by Virgil, and 'cf.' Silius Italicus, 'Punica', ix.,
368-9:--

  Per pectora 'saevas'
  Exceptat 'mortes'.]



[Footnote 15: She expresses the same wish in 'Iliad', iii., 73-4.]

[Footnote 16: Cleopatra. The skill with which Tennyson has here given us,
in quintessence as it were, Shakespeare's superb creation needs no
commentary, but it is somewhat surprising to find an accurate scholar
like Tennyson guilty of the absurdity of representing Cleopatra as of
gipsy complexion. The daughter of Ptolemy Aulates and a lady of Pontus,
she was of Greek descent, and had no taint at all of African
intermixtures. See Peacock's remarks in 'Gryll Grange', p. 206, 7th
edit., 1861.]

[Footnote 17: After this in 1833 and in 1842 are the following stanzas,
afterwards excised:--

  "By him great Pompey dwarfs and suffers pain,
  A mortal man before immortal Mars;
  The glories of great Julius lapse and wane,
  And shrink from suns to stars.

  "That man of all the men I ever knew
  Most touched my fancy.
  O! what days and nights
  We had in Egypt, ever reaping new
  Harvest of ripe delights.

  "Realm-draining revels! Life was one long feast,
  What wit! what words! what sweet words, only made
  Less sweet by the kiss that broke 'em, liking best
  To be so richly stayed!

  "What dainty strifes, when fresh from war's alarms,
  My Hercules, my gallant Antony,
  My mailed captain leapt into my arms,
  Contented there to die!

  "And in those arms he died: I heard my name
  Sighed forth with life: then I shook off all fear:
  Oh, what a little snake stole Caesar's fame!
  What else was left? look here!"

  "With that she tore her robe apart," etc.]


[Footnote l8: This stanza was added in 1843.]

[Footnote 19: 1845-1848. Lybian.]

[Footnote 20: Added in 1845 as a substitute for

"What nights we had in Egypt! I could hit
His humours while I crossed them:
O the life I led him, and the dalliance and the wit,
The flattery and the strife,

which is the reading of 1843. Canopus is a star in Argo, not visible in
the West, but a conspicuous feature in the sky when seen from Egypt, as
Pliny notices, 'Hist. Nat.', vi., xxiv. "Fatentes Canopum noctibus
sidus ingens et clarum". 'Cf.' Manilius, 'Astron.', i.,
216-17, "Nusquam invenies fulgere Canopum donec Niliacas per pontum

MARGARET

First printed in 1833.

Another of Tennyson's delicious fancy portraits, the twin sister to
Adeline.


  1

  O sweet pale Margaret,
  O rare pale Margaret,
  What lit your eyes with tearful power,
  Like moonlight on a falling shower?
  Who lent you, love, your mortal dower
  Of pensive thought and aspect pale,
  Your melancholy sweet and frail
  As perfume of the cuckoo-flower?
  From the westward-winding flood,
  From the evening-lighted wood,
  From all things outward you have won
  A tearful grace, as tho' [1] you stood
  Between the rainbow and the sun.
  The very smile before you speak,
  That dimples your transparent cheek,
  Encircles all the heart, and feedeth
  The senses with a still delight
  Of dainty sorrow without sound,
  Like the tender amber round,
  Which the moon about her spreadeth,
  Moving thro' a fleecy night.


  2

  You love, remaining peacefully,
  To hear the murmur of the strife,
  But enter not the toil of life.
  Your spirit is the calmed sea,
  Laid by the tumult of the fight.
  You are the evening star, alway
  Remaining betwixt dark and bright:
  Lull'd echoes of laborious day
  Come to you, gleams of mellow light
  Float by you on the verge of night.


  3

  What can it matter, Margaret,
  What songs below the waning stars
  The lion-heart, Plantagenet, [2]
  Sang looking thro' his prison bars?
  Exquisite Margaret, who can tell
  The last wild thought of Chatelet, [3]
  Just ere the falling axe did part
  The burning brain from the true heart,
  Even in her sight he loved so well?


  4

  A fairy shield your Genius made
  And gave you on your natal day.
  Your sorrow, only sorrow's shade,
  Keeps real sorrow far away.
  You move not in such solitudes,
  You are not less divine,
  But more human in your moods,
  Than your twin-sister, Adeline.
  Your hair is darker, and your eyes
  Touch'd with a somewhat darker hue,
  And less aerially blue,
  But ever trembling thro' the dew [4]
  Of dainty-woeful sympathies.


  5

  O sweet pale Margaret,
  O rare pale Margaret,
  Come down, come down, and hear me speak:
  Tie up the ringlets on your cheek:
  The sun is just about to set.
  The arching lines are tall and shady,
  And faint, rainy lights are seen,
  Moving in the leavy beech.
  Rise from the feast of sorrow, lady,
  Where all day long you sit between
  Joy and woe, and whisper each.
  Or only look across the lawn,
  Look out below your bower-eaves,
  Look down, and let your blue eyes dawn
  Upon me thro' the jasmine-leaves. [5]

THE BLACKBIRD.

Not in 1833.

This is another poem placed among the poems of 1833, but not printed
till 1842.

O blackbird! sing me something well:
While all the neighbours shoot thee round,
I keep smooth plats of fruitful ground,
Where thou may'st warble, eat and dwell.

  The espaliers and the standards all
  Are thine; the range of lawn and park:
  The unnetted black-hearts ripen dark,
  All thine, against the garden wall.

  Yet, tho' I spared thee all the spring, [1]
  Thy sole delight is, sitting still,
  With that gold dagger of thy bill
  To fret the summer jenneting. [2]

  A golden bill! the silver tongue,
  Cold February loved, is dry:
  Plenty corrupts the melody
  That made thee famous once, when young:

  And in the sultry garden-squares, [3]
  Now thy flute-notes are changed to coarse,
  I hear thee not at all, [4] or hoarse
  As when a hawker hawks his wares.

  Take warning! he that will not sing
  While yon sun prospers in the blue,
  Shall sing for want, ere leaves are new,
  Caught in the frozen palms of Spring.


[Footnote 1: 1842. Yet, though I spared thee kith and kin. And so till
1853, when it was altered to the present reading.]

[Footnote 2: 1842 to 1851. Jennetin, altered in 1853 to present
reading.]

[Footnote 3: 1842. I better brook the drawling stares. Altered, 1843.]

[Footnote 4: 1842. Not hearing thee at all. Altered, 1843.]




THE DEATH OF THE OLD YEAR

First printed in 1833.

Only one alteration has been made in this poem, in line 41, where in
1842 "one' was altered to" twelve ".

  Full knee-deep lies the winter snow,
  And the winter winds are wearily sighing:
  Toll ye the church-bell sad and slow,
  And tread softly and speak low,
  For the old year lies a-dying.
  Old year, you must not die;
  You came to us so readily,
  You lived with us so steadily,
  Old year, you shall not die.

  He lieth still: he doth not move:
  He will not see the dawn of day.
  He hath no other life above.
  He gave me a friend, and a true, true-love,
  And the New-year will take 'em away.
  Old year, you must not go;
  So long as you have been with us,
  Such joy as you have seen with us,
  Old year, you shall not go.

  He froth'd his bumpers to the brim;
  A jollier year we shall not see.
  But tho' his eyes are waxing dim,
  And tho' his foes speak ill of him,
  He was a friend to me.
  Old year, you shall not die;
  We did so laugh and cry with you,
  I've half a mind to die with you,
  Old year, if you must die.

  He was full of joke and jest,
  But all his merry quips are o'er.
  To see him die, across the waste
  His son and heir doth ride post-haste,
  But he'll be dead before.
  Every one for his own.
  The night is starry and cold, my friend,
  And the New-year blithe and bold, my friend,
  Comes up to take his own.

  How hard he breathes! over the snow
  I heard just now the crowing cock.
  The shadows flicker to and fro:
  The cricket chirps: the light burns low:
  'Tis nearly twelve [1] o'clock.
  Shake hands, before you die.
  Old year, we'll dearly rue for you:
  What is it we can do for you?
  Speak out before you die.

  His face is growing sharp and thin.
  Alack! our friend is gone.
  Close up his eyes: tie up his chin:
  Step from the corpse, and let him in
  That standeth there alone,
  And waiteth at the door.
  There's a new foot on the floor, my friend,
  And a new face at the door, my friend,
  A new face at the door.


[Footnote 1: 1833. One.]





TO J. S.

First published in 1833.

This beautiful poem was addressed to James Spedding on the death of his
brother Edward.

  The wind, that beats the mountain, blows
  More softly round the open wold, [1]
  And gently comes the world to those
  That are cast in gentle mould.

  And me this knowledge bolder made,
  Or else I had not dared to flow [2]
  In these words toward you, and invade
  Even with a verse your holy woe.

  'Tis strange that those we lean on most,
  Those in whose laps our limbs are nursed,
  Fall into shadow, soonest lost:
  Those we love first are taken first.

  God gives us love. Something to love
  He lends us; but, when love is grown
  To ripeness, that on which it throve
  Falls off, and love is left alone.

  This is the curse of time. Alas!
  In grief I am not all unlearn'd;
  Once thro' mine own doors Death did pass; [3]
  One went, who never hath return'd.

  He will not smile--nor speak to me
  Once more. Two years his chair is seen
  Empty before us. That was he
  Without whose life I had not been.

  Your loss is rarer; for this star
  Rose with you thro' a little arc
  Of heaven, nor having wander'd far
  Shot on the sudden into dark.

  I knew your brother: his mute dust
  I honour and his living worth:
  A man more pure and bold [4] and just
  Was never born into the earth.

  I have not look'd upon you nigh,
  Since that dear soul hath fall'n asleep.
  Great Nature is more wise than I:
  I will not tell you not to weep.

  And tho' mine own eyes fill with dew,
  Drawn from the spirit thro' the brain, [5]
  I will not even preach to you,
  "Weep, weeping dulls the inward pain".

  Let Grief be her own mistress still.
  She loveth her own anguish deep
  More than much pleasure. Let her will
  Be done--to weep or not to weep.

  I will not say "God's ordinance
  Of Death is blown in every wind";
  For that is not a common chance
  That takes away a noble mind.

  His memory long will live alone
  In all our hearts, as mournful light
  That broods above the fallen sun, [6]
  And dwells in heaven half the night.

  Vain solace! Memory standing near
  Cast down her eyes, and in her throat
  Her voice seem'd distant, and a tear
  Dropt on the letters [7] as I wrote.

  I wrote I know not what. In truth,
  How _should_ I soothe you anyway,
  Who miss the brother of your youth?
  Yet something I did wish to say:

  For he too was a friend to me:
  Both are my friends, and my true breast
  Bleedeth for both; yet it may be
  That only [8] silence suiteth best.

  Words weaker than your grief would make
  Grief more. 'Twere better I should cease;
  Although myself could almost take [9]
  The place of him that sleeps in peace.

  Sleep sweetly, tender heart, in peace:
  Sleep, holy spirit, blessed soul,
  While the stars burn, the moons increase,
  And the great ages onward roll.

  Sleep till the end, true soul and sweet.
  Nothing comes to thee new or strange.
  Sleep full of rest from head to feet;
  Lie still, dry dust, secure of change.

"YOU ASK ME WHY, THO' ILL AT EASE..."

This is another poem which, though included among those belonging to
1833, was not published till 1842. It is an interesting illustration,
like the next poem but one, of Tennyson's political opinions; he was, he
said, "of the same politics as Shakespeare, Bacon and every sane man".
He was either ignorant of the politics of Shakespeare and Bacon or did
himself great injustice by the remark. It would have been more true to
say--for all his works illustrate it--that he was of the same politics
as Burke. He is here, and in all his poems, a Liberal-Conservative in
the proper sense of the term. At the time this trio of poems was written
England was passing through the throes which preceded, accompanied and
followed the Reform Bill, and the lessons which Tennyson preaches in
them were particularly appropriate. He belonged to the Liberal Party
rather in relation to social and religious than to political questions.
Thus he ardently supported the Anti-slavery Convention and advocated the
measure for abolishing subscription to the Thirty-nine Articles, but he
was, as a politician, on the side of Canning, Peel and the Duke of
Wellington, regarding as they did the new-born democracy with mingled
feelings of apprehension and perplexity. His exact attitude is indicated
by some verses written about this time published by his son ('Life', i.,
69-70). If Mr. Aubrey de Vere is correct this and the following poem
were occasioned by some popular demonstrations connected with the Reform
Bill and its rejection by the House of Lords. See 'Life of Tennyson',
vol. i., appendix.

  You ask me, why, tho' [1] ill at ease,
  Within this region I subsist,
  Whose spirits falter in the mist, [2]
  And languish for the purple seas?

  It is the land that freemen till,
  That sober-suited Freedom chose,
  The land, where girt with friends or foes
  A man may speak the thing he will;

  A land of settled government,
  A land of just and old renown,
  Where Freedom broadens slowly down
  From precedent to precedent:

  Where faction seldom gathers head,
  But by degrees to fulness wrought,
  The strength of some diffusive thought
  Hath time and space to work and spread.

  Should banded unions persecute
  Opinion, and induce a time
  When single thought is civil crime,
  And individual freedom mute;

  Tho' Power should make from land to land [3]
  The name of Britain trebly great--
  Tho' every channel [4] of the State
  Should almost choke with golden sand--

  Yet waft me from the harbour-mouth,
  Wild wind! I seek a warmer sky,
  And I will see before I die
  The palms and temples of the South.

"OF OLD SAT FREEDOM ON THE HEIGHTS..."


First published in 1842, but it seems to have been written in 1834. The
fourth and fifth stanzas are given in a postscript of a letter from
Tennyson to James Spedding, dated 1834.

  Of old sat Freedom on the heights,
  The thunders breaking at her feet:
  Above her shook the starry lights:
  She heard the torrents meet.

  There in her place [1] she did rejoice,
  Self-gather'd in her prophet-mind,
  But fragments of her mighty voice
  Came rolling on the wind.

  Then stept she down thro' town and field
  To mingle with the human race,
  And part by part to men reveal'd
  The fullness of her face--

  Grave mother of majestic works,
  From her isle-altar gazing down,
  Who, God-like, grasps the triple forks, [2]
  And, King-like, wears the crown:

  Her open eyes desire the truth.
  The wisdom of a thousand years
  Is in them. May perpetual youth
  Keep dry their light from tears;

  That her fair form may stand and shine,
  Make bright our days and light our dreams,
  Turning to scorn with lips divine
  The falsehood of extremes!



[Footnote 1: 1842 to 1850 inclusive. Within her place. Altered to
present reading, 1850.]

"LOVE THOU THY LAND, WITH LOVE FAR-BROUGHT..."

First published in 1842.

This poem had been written by 1834, for Tennyson sends it in a letter
dated that year to James Spedding (see 'Life',, i., 173).

  Love thou thy land, with love far-brought
  From out the storied Past, and used
  Within the Present, but transfused
  Thro' future time by power of thought.

  True love turn'd round on fixed poles,
  Love, that endures not sordid ends,
  For English natures, freemen, friends,
  Thy brothers and immortal souls.

  But pamper not a hasty time,
  Nor feed with crude imaginings
  The herd, wild hearts and feeble wings,
  That every sophister can lime.

  Deliver not the tasks of might
  To weakness, neither hide the ray
  From those, not blind, who wait for day,
  Tho' [1] sitting girt with doubtful light.

  Make knowledge [2] circle with the winds;
  But let her herald, Reverence, fly
  Before her to whatever sky
  Bear seed of men and growth [3] of minds.

  Watch what main-currents draw the years:
  Cut Prejudice against the grain:
  But gentle words are always gain:
  Regard the weakness of thy peers:

  Nor toil for title, place, or touch
  Of pension, neither count on praise:
  It grows to guerdon after-days:
  Nor deal in watch-words overmuch;

  Not clinging to some ancient saw;
  Not master'd by some modern term;
  Not swift nor slow to change, but firm:
  And in its season bring the law;

  That from Discussion's lip may fall
  With Life, that, working strongly, binds--
  Set in all lights by many minds,
  To close the interests of all.

  For Nature also, cold and warm,
  And moist and dry, devising long,
  Thro' many agents making strong,
  Matures the individual form.

  Meet is it changes should control
  Our being, lest we rust in ease.
  We all are changed by still degrees,
  All but the basis of the soul.

  So let the change which comes be free
  To ingroove itself with that, which flies,
  And work, a joint of state, that plies
  Its office, moved with sympathy.

  A saying, hard to shape an act;
  For all the past of Time reveals
  A bridal dawn of thunder-peals,
  Wherever Thought hath wedded Fact.

  Ev'n now we hear with inward strife
  A motion toiling in the gloom--
  The Spirit of the years to come
  Yearning to mix himself with Life.

  A slow-develop'd strength awaits
  Completion in a painful school;
  Phantoms of other forms of rule,
  New Majesties of mighty States--

  The warders of the growing hour,
  But vague in vapour, hard to mark;
  And round them sea and air are dark
  With great contrivances of Power.

  Of many changes, aptly join'd,
  Is bodied forth the second whole,
  Regard gradation, lest the soul
  Of Discord race the rising wind;

  A wind to puff your idol-fires,
  And heap their ashes on the head;
  To shame the boast so often made, [4]
  That we are wiser than our sires.

  Oh, yet, if Nature's evil star
  Drive men in manhood, as in youth,
  To follow flying steps of Truth
  Across the brazen bridge of war--[5]

  If New and Old, disastrous feud,
  Must ever shock, like armed foes,
  And this be true, till Time shall close,
  That Principles are rain'd in blood;

  Not yet the wise of heart would cease
  To hold his hope thro' shame and guilt,
  But with his hand against the hilt,
  Would pace the troubled land, like Peace;

  Not less, tho' dogs of Faction bay, [6]
  Would serve his kind in deed and word,
  Certain, if knowledge bring the sword,
  That knowledge takes the sword away--

  Would love the gleams of good that broke
  From either side, nor veil his eyes;
  And if some dreadful need should rise
  Would strike, and firmly, and one stroke:

  To-morrow yet would reap to-day,
  As we bear blossom of the dead;
  Earn well the thrifty months, nor wed
  Raw haste, half-sister to Delay.

Tennyson the meaning is probably the obvious one.]

THE GOOSE

This was first published in 1842. No alteration has since been made in
it.

This poem, which was written at the time of the Reform Bill agitation,
is a political allegory showing how illusory were the supposed
advantages held out by the Radicals to the poor and labouring classes.
The old woman typifies these classes, the stranger the Radicals, the
goose the Radical programme, Free Trade and the like, the eggs such
advantages as the proposed Radical measures might for a time seem to
confer, the cluttering goose, the storm and whirlwind the heavy price
which would have to be paid for them in the social anarchy resulting
from triumphant Radicalism. The allegory may be narrowed to the Free
Trade question.


  I knew an old wife lean and poor,
  Her rags scarce held together;
  There strode a stranger to the door,
  And it was windy weather.

  He held a goose upon his arm,
  He utter'd rhyme and reason,
  "Here, take the goose, and keep you warm,
  It is a stormy season".

  She caught the white goose by the leg,
  A goose--'twas no great matter.
  The goose let fall a golden egg
  With cackle and with clatter.

  She dropt the goose, and caught the pelf,
  And ran to tell her neighbours;
  And bless'd herself, and cursed herself,
  And rested from her labours.

  And feeding high, and living soft,
  Grew plump and able-bodied;
  Until the grave churchwarden doff'd,
  The parson smirk'd and nodded.

  So sitting, served by man and maid,
  She felt her heart grow prouder:
  But, ah! the more the white goose laid
  It clack'd and cackled louder.

  It clutter'd here, it chuckled there;
  It stirr'd the old wife's mettle:
  She shifted in her elbow-chair,
  And hurl'd the pan and kettle.

  "A quinsy choke thy cursed note!"
  Then wax'd her anger stronger:
  "Go, take the goose, and wring her throat,
  I will not bear it longer".

  Then yelp'd the cur, and yawl'd the cat;
  Ran Gaffer, stumbled Gammer.
  The goose flew this way and flew that,
  And fill'd the house with clamour.

  As head and heels upon the floor
  They flounder'd all together,
  There strode a stranger to the door,
  And it was windy weather:

  He took the goose upon his arm,
  He utter'd words of scorning;
  "So keep you cold, or keep you warm,
  It is a stormy morning".

  The wild wind rang from park and plain,
  And round the attics rumbled,
  Till all the tables danced again,
  And half the chimneys tumbled.

  The glass blew in, the fire blew out,
  The blast was hard and harder.
  Her cap blew off, her gown blew up,
  And a whirlwind clear'd the larder;

  And while on all sides breaking loose
  Her household fled the danger,
  Quoth she, "The Devil take the goose,
  And God forget the stranger!"





THE EPIC

First published in 1842; "tho'" for "though" in line 44 has been the
only alteration made since 1850.

This Prologue was written, like the Epilogue, after "The Epic" had been
composed, being added, Fitzgerald says, to anticipate or excuse "the
faint Homeric echoes," to give a reason for telling an old-world tale.
The poet "mouthing out his hollow oes and aes" is, we are told, a good
description of Tennyson's tone and manner of reading.


  At Francis Allen's on the Christmas-eve,--
  The game of forfeits done--the girls all kiss'd
  Beneath the sacred bush and past away--
  The parson Holmes, the poet Everard Hall,
  The host, and I sat round the wassail-bowl,
  Then half-way ebb'd: and there we held a talk,
  How all the old honour had from Christmas gone,
  Or gone, or dwindled down to some odd games
  In some odd nooks like this; till I, tired out
  With cutting eights that day upon the pond,
  Where, three times slipping from the outer edge,
  I bump'd the ice into three several stars,
  Fell in a doze; and half-awake I heard
  The parson taking wide and wider sweeps,
  Now harping on the church-commissioners, [1]
  Now hawking at Geology and schism;
  Until I woke, and found him settled down
  Upon the general decay of faith
  Right thro' the world, "at home was little left,
  And none abroad: there was no anchor, none,
  To hold by". Francis, laughing, clapt his hand
  On Everard's shoulder, with "I hold by him".
  "And I," quoth Everard, "by the wassail-bowl."
  "Why, yes," I said, "we knew your gift that way
  At college: but another which you had,
  I mean of verse (for so we held it then),
  What came of that?"  "You know," said Frank, "he burnt
  His epic, his King Arthur, some twelve books "--[2]
  And then to me demanding why? "Oh, sir,
  He thought that nothing new was said, or else
  Something so said 'twas nothing--that a truth
  Looks freshest in the fashion of the day:
  God knows: he has a mint of reasons: ask.
  It pleased _me_ well enough." "Nay, nay," said Hall,
  "Why take the style of those heroic times?
  For nature brings not back the Mastodon,
  Nor we those times; and why should any man
  Remodel models? these twelve books of mine [3]
  Were faint Homeric echoes, nothing-worth,
  Mere chaff and draff, much better burnt."
  "But I," Said Francis, "pick'd the eleventh from this hearth,
  And have it: keep a thing its use will come.
  I hoard it as a sugar-plum for Holmes."
  He laugh'd, and I, though sleepy, like a horse
  That hears the corn-bin open, prick'd my ears;
  For I remember'd Everard's college fame
  When we were Freshmen: then at my request
  He brought it; and the poet little urged,
  But with some prelude of disparagement,
  Read, mouthing out his hollow oes and aes,
  Deep-chested music, and to this result.


[Footnote 1: A burning topic with the clergy in and about 1833.]

[Footnote 2:  1842 to 1844. "You know," said Frank, "he flung His epic
of King Arthur in the fire!" The present reading, 1850.]

[Footnote 3: 1842, 1843.

  Remodel models rather than the life?
  And these twelve books of mine (to speak the truth).

Present reading, 1845.]




MORTE D'ARTHUR

This is Tennyson's first study from Malory's 'Morte d'Arthur'. We learn
from Fitzgerald that it was written as early as the spring of 1835, for
in that year Tennyson read it to Fitzgerald and Spedding, "out of a MS.
in a little red book," and again we learn that he repeated some lines of
it at the end of May, 1835, one calm day on Windermere, adding "Not bad
that, Fitz., is it?" ('Life', i., 184). It is here represented as the
eleventh book of an Epic, the rest of which had been destroyed, though
Tennyson afterwards incorporated it, adding introductory lines, with
what was virtually to prove an Epic in twelve books, 'The Idylls of the
King'. The substance of the poem is drawn from the third, fourth and
fifth chapters of the twenty-first book of Malory's 'Romance', which is
followed very closely. It is called "an Homeric echo," but the diction
bears a much closer resemblance to that of Virgil than to that of Homer,
though the rhythm is perhaps more Homeric than Virgilian. It is
Tennyson's masterpiece in "the grand style," and is indeed as near
perfection as any work of this kind could be. In spite of its singular
mixture of simplicity, purely Homeric, and artificiality, at times
ultra-Virgilian, the incongruity never shocks, so noble and impressive
is the general effect. The text of 1842 was never subsequently altered
except in the spelling of "mere" and "though" in lines 37, 77, 147, 155,
162, 272, and in the insertion in 1853 of the line:--

    "Across the ridge and pac'd beside the mere."



  So all day long the noise of battle roll'd
  Among the mountains by the winter sea;
  Until King Arthur's table, man by man,
  Had fall'n in Lyonness about their Lord,
  King Arthur: then, because his wound was deep,
  The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,
  Sir Bedivere, the last of all his knights,
  And bore him to a chapel nigh the field, [1]
  A broken chancel with a broken cross,
  That stood on a dark strait of barren land.
  On one side lay the Ocean, and on one
  Lay a great water, and the moon was full.
  Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
  "The sequel of to-day unsolders all
  The goodliest fellowship of famous knights
  Whereof this world holds record. Such a sleep
  They sleep--the men I loved. I think that we
  Shall never more, at any future time,
  Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,
  Walking about the gardens and the halls
  Of Camelot, as in the days that were.
  I perish by this people which I made,--
  Tho' Merlin sware that I should come again
  To rule once more--but let what will be, be,
  I am so deeply smitten thro' the helm
  That without help I cannot last till morn.
  Thou therefore take my brand [2] Excalibur,
  Which was my pride: for thou rememberest how
  In those old days, one summer noon, an arm
  Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,
  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,
  Holding the sword--and how I row'd across
  And took it, and have worn it, like a king:
  And, wheresoever I am sung or told
  In aftertime, this also shall be known:
  But now delay not: take Excalibur,
  And fling him far into the middle mere:
  Watch what thou seest, and lightly bring me word."
  To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:
  "It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,
  Aidless, alone, and smitten thro' the helm.
  A little thing may harm a wounded man.
  Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,
  Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word."
  So saying, from the ruin'd shrine he stept
  And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,
  Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,
  Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang
  Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam. He, stepping down
  By zig-zag paths, and juts of pointed rock,
  Came on the shining levels of the lake.
  There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,
  And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon,
  Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth
  And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:
  For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks, [3]
  Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work
  Of subtlest jewellery. He gazed so long
  That both his eyes were dazzled, as he stood,
  This way and that dividing the swift mind, [4]
  In act to throw: but at the last it seem'd
  Better to leave Excalibur conceal'd
  There in the many-knotted waterflags,
  That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.
  So strode he back slow to the wounded king.
  Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
  "Hast thou perform'd my mission which I gave?
  What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"
  And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
  "I heard the ripple washing in the reeds, [5]
  And the wild water lapping on the crag."
  To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:
  "Thou hast betray'd thy nature and thy name,
  Not rendering true answer, as beseem'd
  Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight:
  For surer sign had follow'd, either hand,
  Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.
  This is a shameful thing for men to lie.
  Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again [6]
  As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing
  I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word."
  Then went Sir Bedivere the second time
  Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere, [7]
  Counting the dewy pebbles, fix'd in thought;
  But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,
  How curiously and strangely chased, he smote
  His palms together, and he cried aloud,
  "And if indeed I cast the brand away,
  Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,
  Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,
  Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.
  What good should follow this, if this were done?
  What harm, undone? deep harm to disobey,
  Seeing obedience is the bond of rule,
  Were it well to obey then, if a king demand
  An act unprofitable against himself?
  The king is sick, and knows not what he does.
  What record, or what relic of my lord
  Should be to aftertime, but empty breath
  And rumours of a doubt? but were this kept,
  Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,
  Some one might show it at a joust of arms,
  Saying, 'King Arthur's sword, Excalibur,
  Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.
  Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps
  Upon the hidden bases of the hills."
  So might some old man speak in the aftertime
  To all the people, winning reverence.
  But now much honour and much fame were lost."
  So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,
  And hid Excalibur the second time,
  And so strode back slow to the wounded King.
  Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:
  "What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?"
  And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
  "I heard the water lapping on the crag,
  And the long ripple washing in the reeds."
  To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:
  "Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue, [8]
  Unknightly, traitor-hearted! Woe is me!
  Authority forgets a dying king, [9]
  Laid widow'd of the power in his eye
  That bow'd the will. I see thee what thou art,
  For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,
  In whom should meet the offices of all,
  Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;
  Either from lust of gold, or like a girl
  Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.
  Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,
  And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:
  But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,
  I will arise and slay thee with my hands."
  Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran, [10]
  And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged
  Among the bulrush-beds, and clutch'd the sword,
  And strongly wheel'd and threw it. The great brand
  Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,
  And flashing round and round, and whirl'd in an arch,
  Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,
  Seen where the moving isles of winter shock
  By night, with noises of the northern sea.
  So flash'd and fell the brand Excalibur:
  But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm
  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,
  And caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him
  Three times, and drew him under in the mere.
  And lightly went the other to the King.
  Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:
  "Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.
  Speak out: what is it thou hast heard, or seen?"
  And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
  "Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems
  Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,
  Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,
  Not tho' I live three lives of mortal men,
  So great a miracle as yonder hilt.
  Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;
  But when I look'd again, behold an arm,
  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,
  That caught him by the hilt, and brandish'd him
  Three times, and drew him under in the mere."
  And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:
  "My end draws nigh;'tis time that I were gone.
  Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,
  And bear me to the margin; yet I fear [11]
  My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die."
  So saying, from the pavement he hath rose,
  Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,
  And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes
  As in a picture. Him Sir Bedivere
  Remorsefully regarded thro' his tears,
  And would have spoken, but he found not words,
  Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,
  O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,
  And rising bore him thro' the place of tombs.
  But, as he walk'd, King Arthur panted hard,
  Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed
  When all the house is mute. So sigh'd the King,
  Muttering and murmuring at his ear"
  Quick, quick! I fear it is too late, and I shall die ".
  But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,
  Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walk'd,
  Larger than human on the frozen hills.
  He heard the deep behind him, and a cry
  Before. His own thought drove him like a goad.
  Dry clash'd his harness in the icy caves
  And barren chasms, and all to left and right
  The bare black cliff clang'd round him, as he based
  His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang
  Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels--
  And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,
  And the long glories of the winter moon.
  Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge, [12]
  Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,
  Beneath them; and descending they were ware
  That all the decks were dense with stately forms
  Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream--by these
  Three Queens with crowns of gold--and from them rose
  A cry that shiver'd to the tingling stars,
  And, as it were one voice, an agony
  Of lamentation, like a wind, that shrills
  All night in a waste land, where no one comes,
  Or hath come, since the making of the world.
  Then murmur'd Arthur, "Place me in the barge,"
  And to the barge they came. There those three Queens
  Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept.
  But she, that rose the tallest of them all
  And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,
  And loosed the shatter'd casque, and chafed his hands,
  And call'd him by his name, complaining loud,
  And dropping bitter tears against his brow
  Striped with dark blood: for all his face was white
  And colourless, and like the wither'd moon
  Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;
  And all his greaves and cuisses dash'd with drops
  Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls--
  That made his forehead like a rising sun
  High from the dais-throne--were parch'd with dust;
  Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,
  Mix'd with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.
  So like a shatter'd column lay the King;
  Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,
  From spur to plume a star of tournament,
  Shot thro' the lists at Camelot, and charged
  Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.
  Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere, [13]
  "Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?
  Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?
  For now I see the true old times are dead,
  When every morning brought a noble chance,
  And every chance brought out a noble knight.
  Such times have been not since the light that led
  The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.
  But now the whole ROUND TABLE is dissolved
  Which was an image of the mighty world;
  And I, the last, go forth companionless.
  And the days darken round me, and the years,
  Among new men, strange faces, other minds."
  And slowly answer'd Arthur from the barge:
  "The old order changeth, yielding place to new,
  And God fulfils Himself in many ways, [14]
  Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.
  Comfort thyself: what comfort is in me?
  I have lived my life, and that which I have done
  May He within Himself make pure! but thou,
  If thou shouldst never see my face again,
  Pray for my soul. More things are wrought by prayer
  Than this world dreams of. Wherefore, let thy voice
  Rise like a fountain for me night and day.
  For what are men better than sheep or goats
  That nourish a blind life within the brain,
  If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer
  Both for themselves and those who call them friend?
  For so the whole round earth is every way
  Bound by gold chains [15] about the feet of God.
  But now farewell. I am going a long way
  With these thou seest--if indeed I go--
  (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)
  To the island-valley of Avilion;
  Where falls not hail, or rain, [16] or any snow,
  Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies
  Deep-meadow'd, happy, fair with orchard-lawns
  And bowery hollows crown'd with summer sea, [17]
  Where I will heal me of my grievous wound."
  So said he, and the barge with oar and sail
  Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan
  That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,
  Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood
  With swarthy webs. Long stood Sir Bedivere
  Revolving many memories, till the hull
  Look'd one black dot against the verge of dawn.
  And on the mere the wailing died away.

  Here ended Hall, and our last light, that long
  Had wink'd and threaten'd darkness, flared and fell:
  At which the Parson, sent to sleep with sound,
  And waked with silence, grunted "Good!" but we
  Sat rapt: It was the tone with which he read--
  Perhaps some modern touches here and there
  Redeem'd it from the charge of nothingness--
  Or else we loved the man, and prized his work;
  I know not: but we sitting, as I said,
  The cock crew loud; as at that time of year
  The lusty bird takes every hour for dawn:
  Then Francis, muttering, like a man ill-used,
  "There now--that's nothing!" drew a little back,
  And drove his heel into the smoulder'd log,
  That sent a blast of sparkles up the flue;
  And so to bed; where yet in sleep I seem'd
  To sail with Arthur under looming shores.
  Point after point; till on to dawn, when dreams
  Begin to feel the truth and stir of day,
  To me, methought, who waited with a crowd,
  There came a bark that, blowing forward, bore,
  King Arthur, like a modern gentleman
  Of stateliest port; and all the people cried,
  "Arthur is come again: he cannot die".
  Then those that stood upon the hills behind
  Repeated--"Come again, and thrice as fair";
  And, further inland, voices echoed--
  "Come With all good things, and war shall be no more".
  At this a hundred bells began to peal,
  That with the sound I woke, and heard indeed
  The clear church-bells ring in the Christmas morn.


[Footnote 1: 'Cf. Morte d'Arthur', xxxi., iv.: "They led him betwixt
them to a little chapel from the not far seaside".]

[Footnote 2: 'Cf. Id.', v.:

  "'Therefore,' said Arthur, 'take thou my good sword Excalibur and go
  with it to yonder waterside. And when thou comest there I charge thee
  throw my sword on that water and come again and tell me what thou
  there seest.'

  'My lord,' said Bedivere, 'your commandment shall be done and lightly
  will I bring thee word again.'

  So Sir Bedivere departed and by the way he beheld that noble sword,
  that the pommel and the haft were all of precious stones, and then he
  said to himself, 'If I throw this rich sword in the water, thereof
  shall never come to good but harm and loss'. And then Sir Bedivere hid
  Excalibur under a tree."]

  lightly again and do my command as thou to me art lief and dear; spare

  Then Sir Bedivere returned again and took the sword in his hand, and
  then him thought sin and shame to throw away that noble sword, and so

  riches of the sword. But now go again lightly.... And but if thou do

[Footnote 9: There is a curious illustration of this in an anecdote told

[Footnote 10: 'Romance, Id'., v.:

  "Then Sir Bedivere departed and went to the sword and lightly took it
  up and went to the waterside, and then he bound the girdle about the
  hilt and then he threw the sword as far into the water as he might,
  and then came an arm and a hand above the water, and met it and caught
  it and so shook it thrice and brandished it, and then vanished away
  the hand with the sword in the water."]


[Footnote 11: 'Romance, Id.', v.:

  so they did softly. And there received him three queens with great
  mourning, and so they set him down and in one of their laps King
  Arthur laid his head; and then that queen said: 'Ah, dear brother, why
  have ye tarried so long from me?'"]


[Footnote 13: 'Romance, Id'., v.:

THE GARDENER'S DAUGHTER; OR, THE PICTURES

First published in 1842.


In the 'Gardener's Daughter' we have the first of that delightful series
of poems dealing with scenes and characters from ordinary English life,
and named appropriately 'English Idylls'. The originator of this species
of poetry in England was Southey, in his 'English Eclogues', written
before 1799. In the preface to these eclogues, which are in blank verse,
Southey says: "The following eclogues, I believe, bear no resemblance to
any poems in our language. This species of composition has become
popular in Germany, and I was induced to attempt it by an account of the
German idylls given me in conversation." Southey's eclogues are eight in
number: 'The Old Mansion House', 'The Grandmother's Tale', 'Hannah',
'The Sailor's Mother', 'The Witch', 'The Ruined Cottage', 'The Last of
the Family' and 'The Alderman's Funeral'. Southey was followed by
Wordsworth in 'The Brothers' and 'Michael'. Southey has nothing of the
charm, grace and classical finish of his disciple, but how nearly
Tennyson follows him, as copy and model, may be seen by anyone who
compares Tennyson's studies with 'The Ruined Cottage'. But Tennyson's
real master was Theocritus, whose influence pervades these poems not so
much directly in definite imitation as indirectly in colour and tone.

'The Gardener's Daughter' was written as early as 1835, as it was read
to Fitzgerald in that year ('Life of Tennyson', i., 182). Tennyson
originally intended to insert a prologue to be entitled 'The
Antechamber', which contained an elaborate picture of himself, but he
afterwards suppressed it. It is given in the 'Life', i., 233-4. This
poem stands alone among the Idylls in being somewhat overloaded with
ornament. The text of 1842 remained unaltered through all the subsequent
editions except in line 235. After 1851 the form "tho'" is substituted
for "though".


  This morning is the morning of the day,
  When I and Eustace from the city went
  To see the Gardener's Daughter; I and he,
  Brothers in Art; a friendship so complete
  Portion'd in halves between us, that we grew
  The fable of the city where we dwelt.
  My Eustace might have sat for Hercules;
  So muscular he spread, so broad of breast.
  He, by some law that holds in love, and draws
  The greater to the lesser, long desired
  A certain miracle of symmetry,
  A miniature of loveliness, all grace
  Summ'd up and closed in little;--Juliet, she [1]
  So light of foot, so light of spirit--oh, she
  To me myself, for some three careless moons,
  The summer pilot of an empty heart
  Unto the shores of nothing! Know you not
  Such touches are but embassies of love,
  To tamper with the feelings, ere he found
  Empire for life? but Eustace painted her,
  And said to me, she sitting with us then,
  "When will _you_ paint like this?" and I replied,
  (My words were half in earnest, half in jest),
  "'Tis not your work, but Love's. Love, unperceived,
  A more ideal Artist he than all,
  Came, drew your pencil from you, made those eyes
  Darker than darkest pansies, and that hair
  More black than ashbuds in the front of March."
  And Juliet answer'd laughing, "Go and see
  The Gardener's daughter: trust me, after that,
  You scarce can fail to match his masterpiece ".
  And up we rose, and on the spur we went.
  Not wholly in the busy world, nor quite
  Beyond it, blooms the garden that I love.
  News from the humming city comes to it
  In sound of funeral or of marriage bells;
  And, sitting muffled in dark leaves, you hear
  The windy clanging of the minster clock;
  Although between it and the garden lies
  A league of grass, wash'd by a slow broad stream,
  That, stirr'd with languid pulses of the oar,
  Waves all its lazy lilies, and creeps on,
  Barge-laden, to three arches of a bridge
  Crown'd with the minster-towers.

                                  The fields between
  Are dewy-fresh, browsed by deep-udder'd kine,
  And all about the large lime feathers low,
  The lime a summer home of murmurous wings. [2]
  In that still place she, hoarded in herself,
  Grew, seldom seen: not less among us lived
  Her fame from lip to lip. Who had not heard
  Of Rose, the Gardener's daughter? Where was he,
  So blunt in memory, so old at heart,
  At such a distance from his youth in grief,
  That, having seen, forgot? The common mouth,
  So gross to express delight, in praise of her
  Grew oratory. Such a lord is Love,
  And Beauty such a mistress of the world.
  And if I said that Fancy, led by Love,
  Would play with flying forms and images,
  Yet this is also true, that, long before
  I look'd upon her, when I heard her name
  My heart was like a prophet to my heart,
  And told me I should love. A crowd of hopes,
  That sought to sow themselves like winged seeds,
  Born out of everything I heard and saw,
  Flutter'd about my senses and my soul;
  And vague desires, like fitful blasts of balm
  To one that travels quickly, made the air
  Of Life delicious, and all kinds of thought,
  That verged upon them sweeter than the dream
  Dream'd by a happy man, when the dark East,
  Unseen, is brightening to his bridal morn.
  And sure this orbit of the memory folds
  For ever in itself the day we went
  To see her. All the land in flowery squares,
  Beneath a broad and equal-blowing wind,
  Smelt of the coming summer, as one large cloud [3]
  Drew downward: but all else of heaven was pure
  Up to the Sun, and May from verge to verge,
  And May with me from head to heel. And now,
  As tho' 'twere yesterday, as tho' it were
  The hour just flown, that morn with all its sound
  (For those old Mays had thrice the life of these),
  Rings in mine ears. The steer forgot to graze,
  And, where the hedge-row cuts the pathway, stood,
  Leaning his horns into the neighbour field,
  And lowing to his fellows. From the woods
  Came voices of the well-contented doves.
  The lark could scarce get out his notes for joy,
  But shook his song together as he near'd
  His happy home, the ground. To left and right,
  The cuckoo told his name to all the hills;
  The mellow ouzel fluted in the elm;
  The redcap [4] whistled; [5] and the nightingale
  Sang loud, as tho' he were the bird of day.
  And Eustace turn'd, and smiling said to me,
  "Hear how the bushes echo! by my life,
  These birds have joyful thoughts. Think you they sing
  Like poets, from the vanity of song?
  Or have they any sense of why they sing?
  And would they praise the heavens for what they have?"
  And I made answer, "Were there nothing else
  For which to praise the heavens but only love,
  That only love were cause enough for praise".
  Lightly he laugh'd, as one that read my thought,
  And on we went; but ere an hour had pass'd,
  We reach'd a meadow slanting to the North;
  Down which a well-worn pathway courted us
  To one green wicket in a privet hedge;
  This, yielding, gave into a grassy walk
  Thro' crowded lilac-ambush trimly pruned;
  And one warm gust, full-fed with perfume, blew
  Beyond us, as we enter'd in the cool.
  The garden stretches southward. In the midst
  A cedar spread his dark-green layers of shade.
  The garden-glasses shone, and momently
  The twinkling laurel scatter'd silver lights.
  "Eustace," I said, "This wonder keeps the house."
  He nodded, but a moment afterwards
  He cried, "Look! look!" Before he ceased I turn'd,
  And, ere a star can wink, beheld her there.
  For up the porch there grew an Eastern rose,
  That, flowering high, the last night's gale had caught,
  And blown across the walk. One arm aloft--
  Gown'd in pure white, that fitted to the shape--
  Holding the bush, to fix it back, she stood.
  A single stream of all her soft brown hair
  Pour'd on one side: the shadow of the flowers
  Stole all the golden gloss, and, wavering
  Lovingly lower, trembled on her waist--
  Ah, happy shade--and still went wavering down,
  But, ere it touch'd a foot, that might have danced
  The greensward into greener circles, dipt,
  And mix'd with shadows of the common ground!
  But the full day dwelt on her brows, and sunn'd
  Her violet eyes, and all her Hebe-bloom,
  And doubled his own warmth against her lips,
  And on the bounteous wave of such a breast
  As never pencil drew. Half light, half shade,
  She stood, a sight to make an old man young.
  So rapt, we near'd the house; but she, a Rose
  In roses, mingled with her fragrant toil,
  Nor heard us come, nor from her tendance turn'd
  Into the world without; till close at hand,
  And almost ere I knew mine own intent,
  This murmur broke the stillness of that air
  Which brooded round about her: "Ah, one rose,
  One rose, but one, by those fair fingers cull'd,
  Were worth a hundred kisses press'd on lips
  Less exquisite than thine." She look'd: but all
  Suffused with blushes--neither self-possess'd
  Nor startled, but betwixt this mood and that,
  Divided in a graceful quiet--paused,
  And dropt the branch she held, and turning, wound
  Her looser hair in braid, and stirr'd her lips
  For some sweet answer, tho' no answer came,
  Nor yet refused the rose, but granted it,
  And moved away, and left me, statue-like,
  In act to render thanks. I, that whole day,
  Saw her no more, altho' I linger'd there
  Till every daisy slept, and Love's white star
  Beam'd thro' the thicken'd cedar in the dusk.
  So home we went, and all the livelong way
  With solemn gibe did Eustace banter me.
  "Now," said he, "will you climb the top of Art;
  You cannot fail but work in hues to dim
  The Titianic Flora. Will you match
  My Juliet? you, not you,--the Master,
  Love, A more ideal Artist he than all."

  So home I went, but could not sleep for joy,
  Reading her perfect features in the gloom,
  Kissing the rose she gave me o'er and o'er,
  And shaping faithful record of the glance
  That graced the giving--such a noise of life
  Swarm'd in the golden present, such a voice
  Call'd to me from the years to come, and such
  A length of bright horizon rimm'd the dark.
  And all that night I heard the watchmen peal
  The sliding season: all that night I heard
  The heavy clocks knolling the drowsy hours.
  The drowsy hours, dispensers of all good,
  O'er the mute city stole with folded wings,
  Distilling odours on me as they went
  To greet their fairer sisters of the East.

  Love at first sight, first-born, and heir to all,
  Made this night thus. Henceforward squall nor storm
  Could keep me from that Eden where she dwelt.
  Light pretexts drew me: sometimes a
  Dutch love For tulips; then for roses, moss or musk,
  To grace my city-rooms; or fruits and cream
  Served in the weeping elm; and more and more
  A word could bring the colour to my cheek;
  A thought would fill my eyes with happy dew;
  Love trebled life within me, and with each
  The year increased. The daughters of the year,
  One after one, thro' that still garden pass'd:
  Each garlanded with her peculiar flower
  Danced into light, and died into the shade;
  And each in passing touch'd with some new grace
  Or seem'd to touch her, so that day by day,
  Like one that never can be wholly known, [6]
  Her beauty grew; till Autumn brought an hour
  For Eustace, when I heard his deep "I will,"
  Breathed, like the covenant of a God, to hold
  From thence thro' all the worlds: but I rose up
  Full of his bliss, and following her dark eyes
  Felt earth as air beneath me, [7] till I reach'd
  The wicket-gate, and found her standing there.
  There sat we down upon a garden mound,
  Two mutually enfolded; Love, the third,
  Between us, in the circle of his arms
  Enwound us both; and over many a range
  Of waning lime the gray cathedral towers,
  Across a hazy glimmer of the west,
  Reveal'd their shining windows: from them clash'd
  The bells; we listen'd; with the time we play'd;
  We spoke of other things; we coursed about
  The subject most at heart, more near and near,
  Like doves about a dovecote, wheeling round
  The central wish, until we settled there. [8]
  Then, in that time and place, I spoke to her,
  Requiring, tho' I knew it was mine own,
  Yet for the pleasure that I took to hear,
  Requiring at her hand the greatest gift,
  A woman's heart, the heart of her I loved;
  And in that time and place she answer'd me,
  And in the compass of three little words,
  More musical than ever came in one,
  The silver fragments of a broken voice,
  Made me most happy, faltering [9] "I am thine".
  Shall I cease here? Is this enough to say
  That my desire, like all strongest hopes,
  By its own energy fulfilled itself,
  Merged in completion? Would you learn at full
  How passion rose thro' circumstantial grades
  Beyond all grades develop'd? and indeed
  I had not staid so long to tell you all,
  But while I mused came Memory with sad eyes,
  Holding the folded annals of my youth;
  And while I mused, Love with knit brows went by,
  And with a flying finger swept my lips,
  And spake, "Be wise: not easily forgiven
  Are those, who setting wide the doors, that bar
  The secret bridal chambers of the heart.
  Let in the day". Here, then, my words have end.
  Yet might I tell of meetings, of farewells--
  Of that which came between, more sweet than each,
  In whispers, like the whispers of the leaves
  That tremble round a nightingale--in sighs
  Which perfect Joy, perplex'd for utterance,
  Stole from her [10] sister Sorrow. Might I not tell
  Of difference, reconcilement, pledges given,
  And vows, where there was never need of vows,
  And kisses, where the heart on one wild leap
  Hung tranced from all pulsation, as above
  The heavens between their fairy fleeces pale
  Sow'd all their mystic gulfs with fleeting stars;
  Or while the balmy glooming, crescent-lit,
  Spread the light haze along the river-shores,
  And in the hollows; or as once we met
  Unheedful, tho' beneath a whispering rain
  Night slid down one long stream of sighing wind,
  And in her bosom bore the baby, Sleep.
  But this whole hour your eyes have been intent
  On that veil'd picture--veil'd, for what it holds
  May not be dwelt on by the common day.
  This prelude has prepared thee. Raise thy soul;
  Make thine heart ready with thine eyes: the time
  Is come to raise the veil. Behold her there,
  As I beheld her ere she knew my heart,
  My first, last love; the idol of my youth,
  The darling of my manhood, and, alas!
  Now the most blessed memory of mine age.

DORA

First published in 1842.

This poem had been written as early as 1835, when it was read to
Fitzgerald and Spedding ('Life', i., 182). No alterations were made in
the text after 1853. The story in this poem was taken even to the
minutest details from a prosestory of Miss Mitford's, namely, 'The Tale
of Dora Creswell' ('Our Village', vol. in., 242-53), the only
alterations being in the names, Farmer Cresswell, Dora Creswell, Walter
Cresswell, and Mary Hay becoming respectively Allan, Dora, William, and
Mary Morrison. How carefully the poet has preserved the picturesque
touches of the original may be seen by comparing the following two
passages:--

    And Dora took the child, and went her way
    Across the wheat, and sat upon a mound
    That was unsown, where many poppies grew.
    ...
    She rose and took
    The child once more, and sat upon the mound;
    And made a little wreath of all the flowers
    That grew about, and tied it round his hat.

    "A beautiful child lay on the ground at some distance, whilst a
    young girl, resting from the labour of reaping, was twisting a
    rustic wreath of enamelled cornflowers, brilliant poppies ... round
    its hat."

The style is evidently modelled closely on that of the 'Odyssey'.


  With farmer Allan at the farm abode
  William and Dora. William was his son,
  And she his niece. He often look'd at them,
  And often thought "I'll make them man and wife".
  Now Dora felt her uncle's will in all,
  And yearn'd towards William; but the youth, because
  He had been always with her in the house,
  Thought not of Dora. Then there came a day
  When Allan call'd his son, and said,
  "My son: I married late, but I would wish to see
  My grandchild on my knees before I die:
  And I have set my heart upon a match.
  Now therefore look to Dora; she is well
  To look to; thrifty too beyond her age.
  She is my brother's daughter: he and I
  Had once hard words, and parted, and he died
  In foreign lands; but for his sake I bred
  His daughter Dora: take her for your wife;
  For I have wish'd this marriage, night and day,
  For many years." But William answer'd short;
  "I cannot marry Dora; by my life,
  I will not marry Dora". Then the old man
  Was wroth, and doubled up his hands, and said:
  "You will not, boy! you dare to answer thus!
  But in my time a father's word was law,
  And so it shall be now for me. Look to it;
  Consider, William: take a month to think,
  And let me have an answer to my wish;
  Or, by the Lord that made me, you shall pack,
  And never more darken my doors again."
  But William answer'd madly; bit his lips,
  And broke away. [1] The more he look'd at her
  The less he liked her; and his ways were harsh;
  But Dora bore them meekly. Then before
  The month was out he left his father's house,
  And hired himself to work within the fields;
  And half in love, half spite, he woo'd and wed
  A labourer's daughter, Mary Morrison.

  Then, when the bells were ringing,
  Allan call'd His niece and said: "My girl, I love you well;
  But if you speak with him that was my son,
  Or change a word with her he calls his wife,
  My home is none of yours. My will is law."
  And Dora promised, being meek. She thought,
  "It cannot be: my uncle's mind will change!"

  And days went on, and there was born a boy
  To William; then distresses came on him;
  And day by day he pass'd his father's gate,
  Heart-broken, and his father helped him not.
  But Dora stored what little she could save,
  And sent it them by stealth, nor did they know
  Who sent it; till at last a fever seized
  On William, and in harvest time he died.

  Then Dora went to Mary. Mary sat
  And look'd with tears upon her boy, and thought
  Hard things of Dora. Dora came and said:
  "I have obey'd my uncle until now,
  And I have sinn'd, for it was all thro' me
  This evil came on William at the first.
  But, Mary, for the sake of him that's gone,
  And for your sake, the woman that he chose,
  And for this orphan, I am come to you:
  You know there has not been for these five years
  So full a harvest, let me take the boy,
  And I will set him in my uncle's eye
  Among the wheat; that when his heart is glad
  Of the full harvest, he may see the boy,
  And bless him for the sake of him that's gone."
  And Dora took the child, and went her way
  Across the wheat, and sat upon a mound
  That was unsown, where many poppies grew.
  Far off the farmer came into the field
  And spied her not; for none of all his men
  Dare tell him Dora waited with the child;
  And Dora would have risen and gone to him,
  But her heart fail'd her; and the reapers reap'd
  And the sun fell, and all the land was dark.
  But when the morrow came, she rose and took
  The child once more, and sat upon the mound;
  And made a little wreath of all the flowers
  That grew about, and tied it round his hat
  To make him pleasing in her uncle's eye.
  Then when the farmer passed into the field
  He spied her, and he left his men at work,
  And came and said: "Where were you yesterday?
  Whose child is that? What are you doing here?"
  So Dora cast her eyes upon the ground,
  And answer'd softly, "This is William's child?"
  "And did I not," said Allan, "did I not
  Forbid you, Dora?" Dora said again:
  "Do with me as you will, but take the child
  And bless him for the sake of him that's gone!"
  And Allan said: "I see it is a trick
  Got up betwixt you and the woman there.
  I must be taught my duty, and by you!
  You knew my word was law, and yet you dared
  To slight it. Well--for I will take the boy;
  But go you hence, and never see me more."
  So saying, he took the boy, that cried aloud
  And struggled hard. The wreath of flowers fell
  At Dora's feet. She bow'd upon her hands,
  And the boy's cry came to her from the field,
  More and more distant. She bow'd down her head,
  Remembering the day when first she came,
  And all the things that had been. She bow'd down
  And wept in secret; and the reapers reap'd,
  And the sun fell, and all the land was dark.
  Then Dora went to Mary's house, and stood
  Upon the threshold. Mary saw the boy
  Was not with Dora. She broke out in praise
  To God, that help'd her in her widowhood.
  And Dora said, "My uncle took the boy;
  But, Mary, let me live and work with you:
  He says that he will never see me more".
  Then answer'd Mary, "This shall never be,
  That thou shouldst take my trouble on thyself:
  And, now, I think, he shall not have the boy,
  For he will teach him hardness, and to slight
  His mother; therefore thou and I will go,
  And I will have my boy, and bring him home;
  And I will beg of him to take thee back;
  But if he will not take thee back again,
  Then thou and I will live within one house,
  And work for William's child until he grows
  Of age to help us." So the women kiss'd
  Each other, and set out, and reach'd the farm.
  The door was off the latch: they peep'd, and saw
  The boy set up betwixt his grandsire's knees,
  Who thrust him in the hollows of his arm,
  And clapt him on the hands and on the cheeks,
  Like one that loved him; and the lad stretch'd out
  And babbled for the golden seal, that hung
  From Allan's watch, and sparkled by the fire.
  Then they came in: but when the boy beheld
  His mother, he cried out to come to her:
  And Allan set him down, and Mary said:
  "O Father!--if you let me call you so--
  I never came a-begging for myself,
  Or William, or this child; but now I come
  For Dora: take her back; she loves you well.
  O Sir, when William died, he died at peace
  With all men; for I ask'd him, and he said,
  He could not ever rue his marrying me--
  I have been a patient wife: but, Sir, he said
  That he was wrong to cross his father thus:
  'God bless him!' he said, 'and may he never know
  The troubles I have gone thro'!' Then he turn'd
  His face and pass'd--unhappy that I am!
  But now, Sir, let me have my boy, for you
  Will make him hard, and he will learn to slight
  His father's memory; and take Dora back,
  And let all this be as it was before."
  So Mary said, and Dora hid her face
  By Mary. There was silence in the room;
  And all at once the old man burst in sobs:
  "I have been to blame--to blame. I have kill'd my son.
  I have kill'd him--but I loved him--my dear son.
  May God forgive me!--I have been to blame.
  Kiss me, my children."  Then they clung about
  The old man's neck, and kiss'd him many times.
  And all the man was broken with remorse;
  And all his love came back a hundredfold;
  And for three hours he sobb'd o'er William's child,
  Thinking of William. So those four abode
  Within one house together; and as years
  Went forward, Mary took another mate;
  But Dora lived unmarried till her death.


[Footnote 1: In 1842 thus:--

  "Look to't,
  Consider: take a month to think, and give
  An answer to my wish; or by the Lord
  That made me, you shall pack, and nevermore

  And answered something madly; bit his lips,
  And broke away.

AUDLEY COURT

First published in 1842.

Only four alterations were made in the text after 1842, all of which are
duly noted. Tennyson told his son that the poem was partially suggested
by Abbey Park at Torquay where it was written, and that the last lines
described the scene from the hill looking over the bay. He saw he said
"a star of phosphorescence made by the buoy appearing and disappearing
in the dark sea," but it is curious that the line describing that was
not inserted till long after the poem had been published. The poem,
though a trifle, is a triumph of felicitous description and expression,
whether we regard the pie or the moonlit bay.


  "The Bull, the Fleece are cramm'd, and not a room
  For love or money. Let us picnic there
  At Audley Court." I spoke, while Audley feast
  Humm'd like a hive all round the narrow quay,
  To Francis, with a basket on his arm,
  To Francis just alighted from the boat,
  And breathing of the sea. "With all my heart,"
  Said Francis. Then we shoulder'd thro' [1] the swarm,
  And rounded by the stillness of the beach
  To where the bay runs up its latest horn.
  We left the dying ebb that faintly lipp'd
  The flat red granite; so by many a sweep
  Of meadow smooth from aftermath we reach'd
  The griffin-guarded gates and pass'd thro' all
  The pillar'd dusk [2] of sounding sycamores
  And cross'd the garden to the gardener's lodge,
  With all its casements bedded, and its walls
  And chimneys muffled in the leafy vine.
  There, on a slope of orchard, Francis laid
  A damask napkin wrought with horse and hound,
  Brought out a dusky loaf that smelt of home,
  And, half-cut-down, a pasty costly-made,
  Where quail and pigeon, lark and leveret lay,
  Like fossils of the rock, with golden yolks [3]
  Imbedded and injellied; last with these,
  A flask of cider from his father's vats,
  Prime, which I knew; and so we sat and eat
  And talk'd old matters over; who was dead,
  Who married, who was like to be, and how
  The races went, and who would rent the hall:
  Then touch'd upon the game, how scarce it was
  This season; glancing thence, discuss'd the farm,
  The fourfield system, and the price of grain; [4]
  And struck upon the corn-laws, where we split,
  And came again together on the king
  With heated faces; till he laugh'd aloud;
  And, while the blackbird on the pippin hung
  To hear him, clapt his hand in mine and sang--
  "Oh! who would fight and march and counter-march,
  Be shot for sixpence in a battle-field,
  And shovell'd up into a [5] bloody trench
  Where no one knows? but let me live my life.
  "Oh! who would cast and balance at a desk,
  Perch'd like a crow upon a three-legg'd stool,
  Till all his juice is dried, and all his joints
  Are full of chalk? but let me live my life.
  "Who'd serve the state? for if I carved my name
  Upon the cliffs that guard my native land,
  I might as well have traced it in the sands;
  The sea wastes all: but let me live my life.
  "Oh! who would love? I wooed a woman once,
  But she was sharper than an eastern wind,
  And all my heart turn'd from her, as a thorn
  Turns from the sea: but let me live my life."
  He sang his song, and I replied with mine:
  I found it in a volume, all of songs,
  Knock'd down to me, when old Sir Robert's pride,
  His books--the more the pity, so I said--
  Came to the hammer here in March--and this--
  I set the words, and added names I knew.
  "Sleep, Ellen Aubrey, sleep and dream of me:
  Sleep, Ellen, folded in thy sister's arm,
  And sleeping, haply dream her arm is mine.
  "Sleep, Ellen, folded in Emilia's arm;
  Emilia, fairer than all else but thou,
  For thou art fairer than all else that is.
  "Sleep, breathing health and peace upon her breast:
  Sleep, breathing love and trust against her lip:
  I go to-night: I come to-morrow morn.
  "I go, but I return: I would I were
  The pilot of the darkness and the dream.
  Sleep, Ellen Aubrey, love, and dream of me."
  So sang we each to either, Francis Hale,
  The farmer's son who lived across the bay,
  My friend; and I, that having wherewithal,
  And in the fallow leisure of my life
  A rolling stone of here and everywhere, [6]
  Did what I would; but ere the night we rose
  And saunter'd home beneath a moon that, just
  In crescent, dimly rain'd about the leaf
  Twilights of airy silver, till we reach'd
  The limit of the hills; and as we sank
  From rock to rock upon the gloomy quay,
  The town was hush'd beneath us: lower down
  The bay was oily-calm: the harbour buoy
  With one green sparkle ever and anon [7]
  Dipt by itself, and we were glad at heart. [8]

WALKING TO THE MAIL

First published in 1842. Not altered in any respect after 1853.


'John'.  I'm glad I walk'd.
         How fresh the meadows look
         Above the river, and, but a month ago,
         The whole hill-side was redder than a fox.
         Is yon plantation where this byway joins
         The turnpike? [1]

'James'. Yes.

'John'.  And when does this come by?

'James'. The mail? At one o'clock.

'John'.  What is it now?

James'.  A quarter to.

'John'.  Whose house is that I see? [2]
         No, not the County Member's with the vane:
         Up higher with the yewtree by it, and half
         A score of gables.

'James'. That? Sir Edward Head's:
         But he's abroad: the place is to be sold.

'John'.  Oh, his. He was not broken?

'James'. No, sir, he,
         Vex'd with a morbid devil in his blood
         That veil'd the world with jaundice, hid his face
         From all men, and commercing with himself,
         He lost the sense that handles daily life--
         That keeps us all in order more or less--
         And sick of home went overseas for change.

'John'.  And whither?

'James'. Nay, who knows? he's here and there.
         But let him go; his devil goes with him,
         As well as with his tenant, Jockey Dawes.

'John'.  What's that?

'James-. You saw the man--on Monday, was it?--[3]
         There by the hump-back'd willow; half stands up
         And bristles; half has fall'n and made a bridge;
         And there he caught the younker tickling trout--
         Caught in 'flagrante'--what's the Latin word?--
         'Delicto'; but his house, for so they say,
         Was haunted with a jolly ghost, that shook
         The curtains, whined in lobbies, tapt at doors,
         And rummaged like a rat: no servant stay'd:
         The farmer vext packs up his beds and chairs,
         And all his household stuff; and with his boy
         Betwixt his knees, his wife upon the tilt,
         Sets out, [4] and meets a friend who hails him,
         "What! You're flitting!" "Yes, we're flitting," says the ghost
         (For they had pack'd the thing among the beds).
         "Oh, well," says he, "you flitting with us too--
         Jack, turn the horses' heads and home again". [5]

'John'.  He left 'his' wife behind; for so I heard.

'James'. He left her, yes. I met my lady once:
         A woman like a butt, and harsh as crabs.

'John'.  Oh, yet, but I remember, ten years back--
         'Tis now at least ten years--and then she was--
         You could not light upon a sweeter thing:
         A body slight and round and like a pear
         In growing, modest eyes, a hand a foot
         Lessening in perfect cadence, and a skin
         As clean and white as privet when it flowers.

'James'. Ay, ay, the blossom fades and they that loved
         At first like dove and dove were cat and dog.
         She was the daughter of a cottager,
         Out of her sphere. What betwixt shame and pride,
         New things and old, himself and her, she sour'd
         To what she is: a nature never kind!
         Like men, like manners: like breeds like, they say.
         Kind nature is the best: those manners next
         That fit us like a nature second-hand;
         Which are indeed the manners of the great.

'John'.  But I had heard it was this bill that past,
         And fear of change at home, that drove him hence.

'James'. That was the last drop in the cup of gall.
         I once was near him, when his bailiff brought
         A Chartist pike. You should have seen him wince
         As from a venomous thing: he thought himself
         A mark for all, and shudder'd, lest a cry
         Should break his sleep by night, and his nice eyes
         Should see the raw mechanic's bloody thumbs
         Sweat on his blazon'd chairs; but, sir, you know
         That these two parties still divide the world--
         Of those that want, and those that have: and still
         The same old sore breaks out from age to age
         With much the same result. Now I myself, [6]
         A Tory to the quick, was as a boy
         Destructive, when I had not what I would.
         I was at school--a college in the South:
         There lived a flayflint near; we stole his fruit,
         His hens, his eggs; but there was law for 'us';
         We paid in person. He had a sow, sir. She,
         With meditative grunts of much content, [7]
         Lay great with pig, wallowing in sun and mud.
         By night we dragg'd her to the college tower
         From her warm bed, and up the corkscrew stair
         With hand and rope we haled the groaning sow,
         And on the leads we kept her till she pigg'd.
         Large range of prospect had the mother sow,
         And but for daily loss of one she loved,
         As one by one we took them--but for this--
         As never sow was higher in this world--
         Might have been happy: but what lot is pure!
         We took them all, till she was left alone
         Upon her tower, the Niobe of swine,
         And so return'd unfarrowed to her sty.

'John.'  They found you out?

'James.' Not they.

'John.'  Well--after all--What know we of the secret of a man?
         His nerves were wrong. What ails us, who are sound,
         That we should mimic this raw fool the world,
         Which charts us all in its coarse blacks or whites,
         As ruthless as a baby with a worm,
         As cruel as a schoolboy ere he grows
         To Pity--more from ignorance than will,
         But put your best foot forward, or I fear
         That we shall miss the mail: and here it comes
         With five at top: as quaint a four-in-hand
         As you shall see--three pyebalds and a roan.



[Footnote 1: 1842.

'John'.  I'm glad I walk'd. How fresh the country looks!
         Is yonder planting where this byway joins
         The turnpike?]


[Footnote 2: Thus 1843 to 1850:--

'John'.  Whose house is that I see
         Beyond the watermills?

'James'. Sir Edward Head's: But he's abroad, etc.]


[Footnote 3: Thus 1842 to 1851:--

'James'. You saw the man but yesterday:
         He pick'd the pebble from your horse's foot.
         His house was haunted by a jolly ghost
         That rummaged like a rat.]


[Footnote 4: 1842. Sets forth. Added in 1853.]

[Footnote 5: This is a folk-lore story which has its variants, Mr.
Alfred Nutt tells me, in almost every country in Europe. The
Lincolnshire version of it is given in Miss Peacock's MS. collection of
Lincolnshire folk-lore, of which she has most kindly sent me a copy, and
it runs thus:--"There is a house in East Halton which is haunted by a
hob-thrush.... Some years ago, it is said, a family who had lived in the
house for more than a hundred years were much annoyed by it, and
determined to quit the dwelling. They had placed their goods on a
waggon, and were just on the point of starting when a neighbour asked
the farmer whether he was leaving. On this the hobthrush put his head
out of the splash-churn, which was amongst the household stuff, and
said, 'Ay, we're flitting'. Whereupon the farmer decided to give up the
attempt to escape from it and remain where he was." The same story is
told of a Cluricaune in Croker's 'Fairy Legends and Traditions' in the
South of Ireland. See 'The Haunted Cellar' in p. 81 of the edition of
1862, and as Tennyson has elsewhere in 'Guinevere' borrowed a passage
from the same story (see 'Illustrations of Tennyson', p. 152) it is
probable that that was the source of the story here, though there the
Cluricaune uses the expression, "Here we go altogether".]

THE EARLY POEMS OF

EDWIN MORRIS;

OR, THE LAKE

This poem first appeared in the seventh edition of the Poems, 1851. It
was written at Llanberis. Several alterations were made in the eighth
edition of 1853, since then none, with the exception of "breath" for
"breaths" in line 66.


  O Me, my pleasant rambles by the lake,
  My sweet, wild, fresh three-quarters of a year,
  My one Oasis in the dust and drouth
  Of city life! I was a sketcher then:
  See here, my doing: curves of mountain, bridge,
  Boat, island, ruins of a castle, built
  When men knew how to build, upon a rock,
  With turrets lichen-gilded like a rock:
  And here, new-comers in an ancient hold,
  New-comers from the Mersey, millionaires,
  Here lived the Hills--a Tudor-chimnied bulk
  Of mellow brickwork on an isle of bowers.
  O me, my pleasant rambles by the lake
  With Edwin Morris and with Edward Bull
  The curate; he was fatter than his cure.

  But Edwin Morris, he that knew the names,
  Long-learned names of agaric, moss and fern, [1]
  Who forged a thousand theories of the rocks,
  Who taught me how to skate, to row, to swim,
  Who read me rhymes elaborately good,
  His own--I call'd him Crichton, for he seem'd
  All-perfect, finish'd to the finger nail.[2]
  And once I ask'd him of his early life,
  And his first passion; and he answer'd me;
  And well his words became him: was he not
  A full-cell'd honeycomb of eloquence
  Stored from all flowers? Poet-like he spoke.

  "My love for Nature is as old as I;
  But thirty moons, one honeymoon to that,
  And three rich sennights more, my love for her.
  My love for Nature and my love for her,
  Of different ages, like twin-sisters grew, [3]
  Twin-sisters differently beautiful.
  To some full music rose and sank the sun,
  And some full music seem'd to move and change
  With all the varied changes of the dark,
  And either twilight and the day between;
  For daily hope fulfill'd, to rise again
  Revolving toward fulfilment, made it sweet
  To walk, to sit, to sleep, to wake, to breathe." [4]

  Or this or something like to this he spoke.
  Then said the fat-faced curate Edward Bull,
  "I take it, God made the woman for the man,
  And for the good and increase of the world,
  A pretty face is well, and this is well,
  To have a dame indoors, that trims us up,
  And keeps us tight; but these unreal ways
  Seem but the theme of writers, and indeed
  Worn threadbare. Man is made of solid stuff.
  I say, God made the woman for the man,
  And for the good and increase of the world."

  "Parson," said I, "you pitch the pipe too low:
  But I have sudden touches, and can run
  My faith beyond my practice into his:
  Tho' if, in dancing after Letty Hill,
  I do not hear the bells upon my cap,
  I scarce hear [5] other music: yet say on.
  What should one give to light on such a dream?"
  I ask'd him half-sardonically.
  "Give? Give all thou art," he answer'd, and a light
  Of laughter dimpled in his swarthy cheek;
  "I would have hid her needle in my heart,
  To save her little finger from a scratch
  No deeper than the skin: my ears could hear
  Her lightest breaths: her least remark was worth
  The experience of the wise. I went and came;
  Her voice fled always thro' the summer land;
  I spoke her name alone. Thrice-happy days!
  The flower of each, those moments when we met,
  The crown of all, we met to part no more."

  Were not his words delicious, I a beast
  To take them as I did? but something jarr'd;
  Whether he spoke too largely; that there seem'd
  A touch of something false, some self-conceit,
  Or over-smoothness: howsoe'er it was,
  He scarcely hit my humour, and I said:--

  "Friend Edwin, do not think yourself alone
  Of all men happy. Shall not Love to me,
  As in the Latin song I learnt at school,
  Sneeze out a full God-bless-you right and left? [6]
  But you can talk: yours is a kindly vein:
  I have I think--Heaven knows--as much within;
  Have or should have, but for a thought or two,
  That like a purple beech [7] among the greens
  Looks out of place: 'tis from no want in her:
  It is my shyness, or my self-distrust,
  Or something of a wayward modern mind
  Dissecting passion. Time will set me right."

  So spoke I knowing not the things that were.
  Then said the fat-faced curate, Edward Bull:
  "God made the woman for the use of man,
  And for the good and increase of the world".
  And I and Edwin laugh'd; and now we paused
  About the windings of the marge to hear
  The soft wind blowing over meadowy holms
  And alders, garden-isles [8]; and now we left
  The clerk behind us, I and he, and ran
  By ripply shallows of the lisping lake,
  Delighted with the freshness and the sound.
  But, when the bracken rusted on their crags,
  My suit had wither'd, nipt to death by him
  That was a God, and is a lawyer's clerk,
  The rentroll Cupid of our rainy isles. [9]

  'Tis true, we met; one hour I had, no more:
  She sent a note, the seal an _Elle vous suit_, [10]
  The close "Your Letty, only yours"; and this
  Thrice underscored. The friendly mist of morn
  Clung to the lake. I boated over, ran
  My craft aground, and heard with beating heart
  The Sweet-Gale rustle round the shelving keel;
  And out I stept, and up I crept: she moved,
  Like Proserpine in Enna, gathering flowers: [11]
  Then low and sweet I whistled thrice; and she,
  She turn'd, we closed, we kiss'd, swore faith, I breathed
  In some new planet: a silent cousin stole
  Upon us and departed: "Leave," she cried,
  "O leave me!" "Never, dearest, never: here
  I brave the worst:" and while we stood like fools
  Embracing, all at once a score of pugs
  And poodles yell'd within, and out they came
  Trustees and Aunts and Uncles. "What, with him!
  "Go" (shrill'd the cottonspinning chorus) "him!"
  I choked. Again they shriek'd the burthen "Him!"
  Again with hands of wild rejection "Go!--
  Girl, get you in!" She went--and in one month [12]
  They wedded her to sixty thousand pounds,
  To lands in Kent and messuages in York,
  And slight Sir Robert with his watery smile
  And educated whisker. But for me,
  They set an ancient creditor to work:
  It seems I broke a close with force and arms:
  There came a mystic token from the king
  To greet the sheriff, needless courtesy!
  I read, and fled by night, and flying turn'd:
  Her taper glimmer'd in the lake below:
  I turn'd once more, close-button'd to the storm;
  So left the place, [13] left Edwin, nor have seen
  Him since, nor heard of her, nor cared to hear.
  Nor cared to hear? perhaps; yet long ago
  I have pardon'd little Letty; not indeed,
  It may be, for her own dear sake but this,
  She seems a part of those fresh days to me;
  For in the dust and drouth of London life
  She moves among my visions of the lake,
  While the prime swallow dips his wing, or then
  While the gold-lily blows, and overhead
  The light cloud smoulders on the summer crag.

ST. SIMEON STYLITES

First published in 1842, reprinted in all the subsequent editions of the
poems but with no alterations in the text, except that in eighth line
from the end "my" was substituted for "mine" in 1846. Tennyson informed
a friend that it was not from the 'Acta Sanctorum', but from Hone's
'Every-Day Book', vol. i., pp. 35-36, that he got the material for this
poem, and a comparison with the narrative in Hone and the poem seems to
show that this was the case.

It is not easy to identify the St. Simeon Stylites of Hone's narrative
and Tennyson's poem, whether he is to be identified with St. Simeon the
Elder, of whom there are three memoirs given in the 'Acta Sanctorum',
tom. i., 5th January, 261-286, or with St. Simeon Stylites, Junior, of
whom there is an elaborate biography in Greek by Nicephorus printed with
a Latin translation and notes in the 'Acta Sanctorum', tom. v., 24th
May, 298-401. It seems clear that whoever compiled the account
popularised by Hone had read both and amalgamated them. The main lines
in the story of both saints are exactly the same. Both stood on columns,
both tortured themselves in the same ways, both wrought miracles, and
both died at their posts of penance. St. Simeon the Elder was born at
Sisan in Syria about A.D. 390, and was buried at Antioch in A.D. 459 or
460. The Simeon the Younger was born at Antioch A. D. 521 and died in
A.D. 592. His life, which is of singular interest, is much more
elaborately related.

This poem is not simply a dramatic study. It bears very directly on
Tennyson's philosophy of life. In these early poems he has given us four
studies in the morbid anatomy of character: 'The Palace of Art', which
illustrates the abuse of aesthetic and intellectual enjoyment of self;
'The Vision of Sin', which illustrates the effects of similar indulgence
in the grosser pleasures of the senses; 'The Two Voices', which
illustrates the mischief of despondent self-absorption, while the
present poem illustrates the equally pernicious indulgence in an
opposite extreme, asceticism affected for the mere gratification of
personal vanity.


  Altho' I be the basest of mankind,
  From scalp to sole one slough and crust of sin,
  Unfit for earth, unfit for heaven, scarce meet
  For troops of devils, mad with blasphemy,
  I will not cease to grasp the hope I hold
  Of saintdom, and to clamour, morn and sob,
  Battering the gates of heaven with storms of prayer,
  Have mercy, Lord, and take away my sin.
  Let this avail, just, dreadful, mighty God,
  This not be all in vain that thrice ten years,
  Thrice multiplied by superhuman pangs,
  In hungers and in thirsts, fevers and cold,
  In coughs, aches, stitches, ulcerous throes and cramps,
  A sign betwixt the meadow and the cloud,
  Patient on this tall pillar I have borne
  Rain, wind, frost, heat, hail, damp, and sleet, and snow;
  And I had hoped that ere this period closed
  Thou wouldst have caught me up into Thy rest,
  Denying not these weather-beaten limbs
  The meed of saints, the white robe and the palm.
  O take the meaning, Lord: I do not breathe,
  Not whisper, any murmur of complaint.
  Pain heap'd ten-hundred-fold to this, were still
  Less burthen, by ten-hundred-fold, to bear,
  Than were those lead-like tons of sin, that crush'd
  My spirit flat before thee. O Lord, Lord,
  Thou knowest I bore this better at the first,
  For I was strong and hale of body then;
  And tho' my teeth, which now are dropt away,
  Would chatter with the cold, and all my beard
  Was tagg'd with icy fringes in the moon,
  I drown'd the whoopings of the owl with sound
  Of pious hymns and psalms, and sometimes saw
  An angel stand and watch me, as I sang.
  Now am I feeble grown; my end draws nigh;
  I hope my end draws nigh: half deaf I am,
  So that I scarce can hear the people hum
  About the column's base, and almost blind,
  And scarce can recognise the fields I know;
  And both my thighs are rotted with the dew;
  Yet cease I not to clamour and to cry,
  While my stiff spine can hold my weary head,
  Till all my limbs drop piecemeal from the stone,
  Have mercy, mercy: take away my sin.
  O Jesus, if thou wilt not save my soul,
  Who may be saved? who is it may be saved?
  Who may be made a saint, if I fail here?
  Show me the man hath suffered more than I.
  For did not all thy martyrs die one death?
  For either they were stoned, or crucified,
  Or burn'd in fire, or boil'd in oil, or sawn
  In twain beneath the ribs; but I die here
  To-day, and whole years long, a life of death.
  Bear witness, if I could have found a way
  (And heedfully I sifted all my thought)
  More slowly-painful to subdue this home
  Of sin, my flesh, which I despise and hate,
  I had not stinted practice, O my God.
  For not alone this pillar-punishment, [1]
  Not this alone I bore: but while I lived
  In the white convent down the valley there,
  For many weeks about my loins I wore
  The rope that haled the buckets from the well,
  Twisted as tight as I could knot the noose;
  And spake not of it to a single soul,
  Until the ulcer, eating thro' my skin,
  Betray'd my secret penance, so that all
  My brethren marvell'd greatly. More than this
  I bore, whereof, O God, thou knowest all.[2]
  Three winters, that my soul might grow to thee,
  I lived up there on yonder mountain side.
  My right leg chain'd into the crag, I lay
  Pent in a roofless close of ragged stones;
  Inswathed sometimes in wandering mist, and twice
  Black'd with thy branding thunder, and sometimes
  Sucking the damps for drink, and eating not,
  Except the spare chance-gift of those that came
  To touch my body and be heal'd, and live:
  And they say then that I work'd miracles,
  Whereof my fame is loud amongst mankind,
  Cured lameness, palsies, cancers. Thou, O God,
  Knowest alone whether this was or no.
  Have mercy, mercy; cover all my sin.

  Then, that I might be more alone with thee, [3]
  Three years I lived upon a pillar, high
  Six cubits, and three years on one of twelve;
  And twice three years I crouch'd on one that rose
  Twenty by measure; last of all, I grew
  Twice ten long weary weary years to this,
  That numbers forty cubits from the soil.
  I think that I have borne as much as this--
  Or else I dream--and for so long a time,
  If I may measure time by yon slow light,
  And this high dial, which my sorrow crowns--
  So much--even so. And yet I know not well,
  For that the evil ones comes here, and say,
  "Fall down, O Simeon: thou hast suffer'd long
  For ages and for ages!" then they prate
  Of penances I cannot have gone thro',
  Perplexing me with lies; and oft I fall,
  Maybe for months, in such blind lethargies,
  That Heaven, and Earth, and Time are choked. But yet
  Bethink thee, Lord, while thou and all the saints
  Enjoy themselves in Heaven, and men on earth
  House in the shade of comfortable roofs,
  Sit with their wives by fires, eat wholesome food,
  And wear warm clothes, and even beasts have stalls,
  I, 'tween the spring and downfall of the light,
  Bow down one thousand and two hundred times,
  To Christ, the Virgin Mother, and the Saints;
  Or in the night, after a little sleep,
  I wake: the chill stars sparkle; I am wet
  With drenching dews, or stiff with crackling frost.
  I wear an undress'd goatskin on my back;
  A grazing iron collar grinds my neck;
  And in my weak, lean arms I lift the cross,
  And strive and wrestle with thee till I die:
  O mercy, mercy! wash away my sin.
  O Lord, thou knowest what a man I am;
  A sinful man, conceived and born in sin:
  'Tis their own doing; this is none of mine;
  Lay it not to me. Am I to blame for this,
  That here come those that worship me? Ha! ha!
  They think that I am somewhat. What am I?
  The silly people take me for a saint,
  And bring me offerings of fruit and flowers:
  And I, in truth (thou wilt bear witness here)
  Have all in all endured as much, and more
  Than many just and holy men, whose names
  Are register'd and calendar'd for saints.
  Good people, you do ill to kneel to me.
  What is it I can have done to merit this?
  I am a sinner viler than you all.
  It may be I have wrought some miracles, [4]
  And cured some halt and maim'd; but what of that?
  It may be, no one, even among the saints,
  May match his pains with mine; but what of that?
  Yet do not rise: for you may look on me,
  And in your looking you may kneel to God.
  Speak! is there any of you halt or maim'd?
  I think you know I have some power with Heaven
  From my long penance: let him speak his wish.
  Yes, I can heal. Power goes forth from me.
  They say that they are heal'd. Ah, hark! they shout
  "St. Simeon Stylites". Why, if so,
  God reaps a harvest in me. O my soul,
  God reaps a harvest in thee. If this be,
  Can I work miracles and not be saved?
  This is not told of any. They were saints.
  It cannot be but that I shall be saved;
  Yea, crown'd a saint. They shout, "Behold a saint!"
  And lower voices saint me from above.
  Courage, St. Simeon! This dull chrysalis
  Cracks into shining wings, and hope ere death
  Spreads more and more and more, that God hath now
  Sponged and made blank of crimeful record all
  My mortal archives. O my sons, my sons,
  I, Simeon of the pillar, by surname Stylites, among men;
  I, Simeon, The watcher on the column till the end;
  I, Simeon, whose brain the sunshine bakes;
  I, whose bald brows in silent hours become
  Unnaturally hoar with rime, do now
  From my high nest of penance here proclaim
  That Pontius and Iscariot by my side
  Show'd like fair seraphs. On the coals I lay,
  A vessel full of sin: all hell beneath
  Made me boil over. Devils pluck'd my sleeve; [5]
  Abaddon and Asmodeus caught at me.
  I smote them with the cross; they swarm'd again.
  In bed like monstrous apes they crush'd my chest:
  They flapp'd my light out as I read: I saw
  Their faces grow between me and my book:
  With colt-like whinny and with hoggish whine
  They burst my prayer. Yet this way was left,
  And by this way I'scaped them. Mortify
  Your flesh, like me, with scourges and with thorns;
  Smite, shrink not, spare not. If it may be, fast
  Whole Lents, and pray. I hardly, with slow steps,
  With slow, faint steps, and much exceeding pain,
  Have scrambled past those pits of fire, that still
  Sing in mine ears. But yield not me the praise:
  God only thro' his bounty hath thought fit,
  Among the powers and princes of this world,
  To make me an example to mankind,
  Which few can reach to. Yet I do not say
  But that a time may come--yea, even now,
  Now, now, his footsteps smite the threshold stairs
  Of life--I say, that time is at the doors
  When you may worship me without reproach;
  For I will leave my relics in your land,
  And you may carve a shrine about my dust,
  And burn a fragrant lamp before my bones,
  When I am gather'd to the glorious saints.
  While I spake then, a sting of shrewdest pain
  Ran shrivelling thro' me, and a cloudlike change,
  In passing, with a grosser film made thick
  These heavy, horny eyes. The end! the end!
  Surely the end! What's here? a shape, a shade,
  A flash of light. Is that the angel there
  That holds a crown? Come, blessed brother, come,
  I know thy glittering face. I waited long;
  My brows are ready. What! deny it now?
  Nay, draw, draw, draw nigh. So I clutch it. Christ!
  'Tis gone: 'tis here again; the crown! the crown! [6]
  So now 'tis fitted on and grows to me,
  And from it melt the dews of Paradise,
  Sweet! sweet! spikenard, and balm, and frankincense.
  Ah! let me not be fool'd, sweet saints: I trust
  That I am whole, and clean, and meet for Heaven.
  Speak, if there be a priest, a man of God,
  Among you there, and let him presently
  Approach, and lean a ladder on the shaft,
  And climbing up into my airy home,
  Deliver me the blessed sacrament;
  For by the warning of the Holy Ghost,
  I prophesy that I shall die to-night,
  A quarter before twelve. [7] But thou, O Lord,
  Aid all this foolish people; let them take
  Example, pattern: lead them to thy light.

[Footnote 1: For this incident 'cf. Acta', v., 317:

  "Petit aliquando ab aliquo ad se invisente funem, acceptumque circa
  corpus convolvit constringitque tarn arete ut, exesa carne, quae istuc
  mollis admodum ac tenera est, nudae costae exstarent".

The same is told also of the younger Stylites, where the incident of
concealing the torture is added, 'Acta', i., 265.]


[Footnote 2: For this retirement to a mountain see 'Acta', i., 270, and
it is referred to in the other lives:

  "Post haec egressus occulte perrexit in montem non longe a monasterio,
  ibique sibi clausulam de sicca petra fecit, et stetit sic annos
  tres."]


[Footnote 3: In accurate accordance with the third life, 'Acta',
i., 277:

  "Primum quidem columna ad sex erecta cubitos est, deinde ad duodecim,
  post ad vigenti extensa est";

but for the thirty-six cubits which is assigned as the height of the
last column Tennyson's authority, drawing on another account ('Id'.,
271), substitutes forty:

  "Fecerunt illi columnam habentem cubitos quadraginta".]


[Footnote 4: For the miracles wrought by him see all the lives.]

[Footnote 5:  These details seem taken from the well-known stories about
Luther and Bunyan. All that the 'Acta' say about St. Simeon is that
he was pestered by devils.]

[Footnote 6: The 'Acta' say nothing about the crown, but dwell on the
supernatural fragrance which exhaled from the saint.]

[Footnote 7: Tennyson has given a very poor substitute for the
beautifully pathetic account given of the death of St. Simeon in 'Acta',
i., 168, and again in the ninth chapter of the second Life, 'Ibid'.,
273. But this is to be explained perhaps by the moral purpose of the
poem.]







THE TALKING OAK

First published in 1842, and republished in all subsequent editions with
only two slight alterations: in line 113 a mere variant in spelling, and
in line 185, where in place of the present reading the editions between
1842 and 1848 read, "For, ah! the Dryad-days were brief".

Tennyson told Mr. Aubrey de Vere that the poem was an experiment meant
to test the degree in which it is in the power of poetry to humanise
external nature. Tennyson might have remembered that Ovid had made the
same experiment nearly two thousand years ago, while Goethe had
immediately anticipated him in his charming 'Der Junggesett und der
Muhlbach'. There was certainly no novelty in such an attempt. The poem
is in parts charmingly written, but the oak is certainly "garrulously
given," and comes perilously near to tediousness.


  Once more the gate behind me falls;
  Once more before my face
  I see the moulder'd Abbey-walls,
  That stand within the chace.

  Beyond the lodge the city lies,
  Beneath its drift of smoke;
  And ah! with what delighted eyes
  I turn to yonder oak.

  For when my passion first began,
  Ere that, which in me burn'd,
  The love, that makes me thrice a man,
  Could hope itself return'd;

  To yonder oak within the field
  I spoke without restraint,
  And with a larger faith appeal'd
  Than Papist unto Saint.

  For oft I talk'd with him apart,
  And told him of my choice,
  Until he plagiarised a heart,
  And answer'd with a voice.

  Tho' what he whisper'd, under Heaven
  None else could understand;
  I found him garrulously given,
  A babbler in the land.

  But since I heard him make reply
  Is many a weary hour;
  'Twere well to question him, and try
  If yet he keeps the power.

  Hail, hidden to the knees in fern,
  Broad Oak of Sumner-chace,
  Whose topmost branches can discern
  The roofs of Sumner-place!

  Say thou, whereon I carved her name,
  If ever maid or spouse,
  As fair as my Olivia, came
  To rest beneath thy boughs.--

  "O Walter, I have shelter'd here
  Whatever maiden grace
  The good old Summers, year by year,
  Made ripe in Sumner-chace:

  "Old Summers, when the monk was fat,
  And, issuing shorn and sleek,
  Would twist his girdle tight, and pat
  The girls upon the cheek.

  "Ere yet, in scorn of Peter's-pence,
  And number'd bead, and shrift,
  Bluff Harry broke into the spence, [1]
  And turn'd the cowls adrift:

  "And I have seen some score of those
  Fresh faces, that would thrive
  When his man-minded offset rose
  To chase the deer at five;

  "And all that from the town would stroll,
  Till that wild wind made work
  In which the gloomy brewer's soul
  Went by me, like a stork:

  "The slight she-slips of loyal blood,
  And others, passing praise,
  Strait-laced, but all too full in bud
  For puritanic stays: [2]

  "And I have shadow'd many a group
  Of beauties, that were born
  In teacup-times of hood and hoop,
  Or while the patch was worn;

  "And, leg and arm with love-knots gay,
  About me leap'd and laugh'd
  The Modish Cupid of the day,
  And shrill'd his tinsel shaft.

  "I swear (and else may insects prick
  Each leaf into a gall)
  This girl, for whom your heart is sick,
  Is three times worth them all;

  "For those and theirs, by Nature's law,
  Have faded long ago;
  But in these latter springs I saw
  Your own Olivia blow,

  "From when she gamboll'd on the greens,
  A baby-germ, to when
  The maiden blossoms of her teens
  Could number five from ten.

  "I swear, by leaf, and wind, and rain
  (And hear me with thine ears),
  That, tho' I circle in the grain
  Five hundred rings of years--

  "Yet, since I first could cast a shade,
  Did never creature pass
  So slightly, musically made,
  So light upon the grass:

  "For as to fairies, that will flit
  To make the greensward fresh,
  I hold them exquisitely knit,
  But far too spare of flesh."

  Oh, hide thy knotted knees in fern,
  And overlook the chace;
  And from thy topmost branch discern
  The roofs of Sumner-place.

  But thou, whereon I carved her name,
  That oft hast heard my vows,
  Declare when last Olivia came
  To sport beneath thy boughs.

  "O yesterday, you know, the fair
  Was holden at the town;
  Her father left his good arm-chair,
  And rode his hunter down.

  "And with him Albert came on his.
  I look'd at him with joy:
  As cowslip unto oxlip is,
  So seems she to the boy.

  "An hour had past--and, sitting straight
  Within the low-wheel'd chaise,
  Her mother trundled to the gate
  Behind the dappled grays.

  "But, as for her, she stay'd [3] at home,
  And on the roof she went,
  And down the way you use to come,
  She look'd with discontent.

  "She left the novel half-uncut
  Upon the rosewood shelf;
  She left the new piano shut:
  She could not please herself.

  "Then ran she, gamesome as the colt,
  And livelier than a lark
  She sent her voice thro' all the holt
  Before her, and the park.

  "A light wind chased her on the wing,
  And in the chase grew wild,
  As close as might be would he cling
  About the darling child:

  "But light as any wind that blows
  So fleetly did she stir,
  The flower she touch'd on dipt and rose,
  And turn'd to look at her.

  "And here she came, and round me play'd,
  And sang to me the whole
  Of those three stanzas that you made
  About my 'giant bole';

  "And in a fit of frolic mirth
  She strove to span my waist:
  Alas, I was so broad of girth,
  I could not be embraced.

  "I wish'd myself the fair young beech
  That here beside me stands,
  That round me, clasping each in each,
  She might have lock'd her hands.

  "Yet seem'd the pressure thrice as sweet
  As woodbine's fragile hold,
  Or when I feel about my feet
  The berried briony fold."

  O muffle round thy knees with fern,
  And shadow Sumner-chace!
  Long may thy topmost branch discern
  The roofs of Sumner-place!

  But tell me, did she read the name
  I carved with many vows
  When last with throbbing heart I came
  To rest beneath thy boughs?

  "O yes, she wander'd round and round
  These knotted knees of mine,
  And found, and kiss'd the name she found,
  And sweetly murmur'd thine.

  "A teardrop trembled from its source,
  And down my surface crept.
  My sense of touch is something coarse,
  But I believe she wept.

  "Then flush'd her cheek with rosy light,
  She glanced across the plain;
  But not a creature was in sight:
  She kiss'd me once again.

  "Her kisses were so close and kind,
  That, trust me on my word,
  Hard wood I am, and wrinkled rind,
  But yet my sap was stirr'd:

  "And even into my inmost ring
  A pleasure I discern'd
  Like those blind motions of the Spring,
  That show the year is turn'd.

  "Thrice-happy he that may caress
  The ringlet's waving balm
  The cushions of whose touch may press
  The maiden's tender palm.

  "I, rooted here among the groves,
  But languidly adjust
  My vapid vegetable loves [4]
  With anthers and with dust:

  "For, ah! my friend, the days were brief [5]
  Whereof the poets talk,
  When that, which breathes within the leaf,
  Could slip its bark and walk.

  "But could I, as in times foregone,
  From spray, and branch, and stem,
  Have suck'd and gather'd into one
  The life that spreads in them,

  "She had not found me so remiss;
  But lightly issuing thro',
  I would have paid her kiss for kiss
  With usury thereto."

  O flourish high, with leafy towers,
  And overlook the lea,
  Pursue thy loves among the bowers,
  But leave thou mine to me.

  O flourish, hidden deep in fern,
  Old oak, I love thee well;
  A thousand thanks for what I learn
  And what remains to tell.

  "'Tis little more: the day was warm;
  At last, tired out with play,
  She sank her head upon her arm,
  And at my feet she lay.

  "Her eyelids dropp'd their silken eaves.
  I breathed upon her eyes
  Thro' all the summer of my leaves
  A welcome mix'd with sighs.

  "I took the swarming sound of life--
  The music from the town--
  The murmurs of the drum and fife
  And lull'd them in my own.

  "Sometimes I let a sunbeam slip,
  To light her shaded eye;
  A second flutter'd round her lip
  Like a golden butterfly;

  "A third would glimmer on her neck
  To make the necklace shine;
  Another slid, a sunny fleck,
  From head to ancle fine.

  "Then close and dark my arms I spread,
  And shadow'd all her rest--
  Dropt dews upon her golden head,
  An acorn in her breast.

  "But in a pet she started up,
  And pluck'd it out, and drew
  My little oakling from the cup,
  And flung him in the dew.

  "And yet it was a graceful gift--
  I felt a pang within
  As when I see the woodman lift
  His axe to slay my kin.

  "I shook him down because he was
  The finest on the tree.
  He lies beside thee on the grass.
  O kiss him once for me.

  "O kiss him twice and thrice for me,
  That have no lips to kiss,
  For never yet was oak on lea
  Shall grow so fair as this."

  Step deeper yet in herb and fern,
  Look further thro' the chace,
  Spread upward till thy boughs discern
  The front of Sumner-place.

  This fruit of thine by Love is blest,
  That but a moment lay
  Where fairer fruit of Love may rest
  Some happy future day.

  I kiss it twice, I kiss it thrice,
  The warmth it thence shall win
  To riper life may magnetise
  The baby-oak within.

  But thou, while kingdoms overset,
  Or lapse from hand to hand,
  Thy leaf shall never fail, nor yet
  Thine acorn in the land.

  May never saw dismember thee,
  Nor wielded axe disjoint,
  That art the fairest-spoken tree
  From here to Lizard-point.

  O rock upon thy towery top
  All throats that gurgle sweet!
  All starry culmination drop
  Balm-dews to bathe thy feet!

  All grass of silky feather grow--
  And while he sinks or swells
  The full south-breeze around thee blow
  The sound of minster bells.

  The fat earth feed thy branchy root,
  That under deeply strikes!
  The northern morning o'er thee shoot
  High up, in silver spikes!

  Nor ever lightning char thy grain,
  But, rolling as in sleep,
  Low thunders bring the mellow rain,
  That makes thee broad and deep!

  And hear me swear a solemn oath,
  That only by thy side
  Will I to Olive plight my troth,
  And gain her for my bride.

  And when my marriage morn may fall,
  She, Dryad-like, shall wear
  Alternate leaf and acorn-ball
  In wreath about her hair.

  And I will work in prose and rhyme,
  And praise thee more in both
  Than bard has honour'd beech or lime,
  Or that Thessalian growth, [6]

  In which the swarthy ringdove sat,
  And mystic sentence spoke;
  And more than England honours that,
  Thy famous brother-oak,

  Wherein the younger Charles abode
  Till all the paths were dim,
  And far below the Roundhead rode,
  And humm'd a surly hymn.

LOVE AND DUTY

Published first in 1842.

Whether this beautiful poem is autobiographical and has reference to the
compulsory separation of Tennyson and Miss Emily Sellwood, afterwards
his wife, in 1840, it is impossible for this editor to say, as Lord
Tennyson in his 'Life' of his father is silent on the subject.


  Of love that never found his earthly close,
  What sequel? Streaming eyes and breaking hearts?
  Or all the same as if he had not been?
  Not so. Shall Error in the round of time
  Still father Truth? O shall the braggart shout [1]
  For some blind glimpse of freedom work itself
  Thro' madness, hated by the wise, to law
  System and empire? Sin itself be found
  The cloudy porch oft opening on the Sun?
  And only he, this wonder, dead, become
  Mere highway dust? or year by year alone
  Sit brooding in the ruins of a life,
  Nightmare of youth, the spectre of himself!
  If this were thus, if this, indeed, were all,
  Better the narrow brain, the stony heart,
  The staring eye glazed o'er with sapless days,
  The long mechanic pacings to and fro,
  The set gray life, and apathetic end.
  But am I not the nobler thro' thy love?
  O three times less unworthy! likewise thou
  Art more thro' Love, and greater than thy years.
  The Sun will run his orbit, and the Moon
  Her circle. Wait, and Love himself will bring
  The drooping flower of knowledge changed to fruit
  Of wisdom. [2] Wait: my faith is large in Time,
  And that which shapes it to some perfect end.
  Will some one say, then why not ill for good?
  Why took ye not your pastime? To that man
  My work shall answer, since I knew the right
  And did it; for a man is not as God,
  But then most Godlike being most a man.--
  So let me think 'tis well for thee and me--
  Ill-fated that I am, what lot is mine
  Whose foresight preaches peace, my heart so slow
  To feel it! For how hard it seem'd to me,
  When eyes, love-languid thro' half-tears, would dwell
  One earnest, earnest moment upon mine,
  Then not to dare to see! when thy low voice,
  Faltering, would break its syllables, to keep
  My own full-tuned,--hold passion in a leash,
  And not leap forth and fall about thy neck,
  And on thy bosom, (deep-desired relief!)
  Rain out the heavy mist of tears, that weigh'd
  Upon my brain, my senses, and my soul!
  For love himself took part against himself
  To warn us off, and Duty loved of Love--
  O this world's curse--beloved but hated--came Like
  Death betwixt thy dear embrace and mine,
  And crying, "Who is this? behold thy bride,"
  She push'd me from thee.

                          If the sense is hard
  To alien ears, I did not speak to these--
  No, not to thee, but to thyself in me:
  Hard is my doom and thine: thou knowest it all.
  Could Love part thus? was it not well to speak,
  To have spoken once? It could not but be well.
  The slow sweet hours that bring us all things good, [3]
  The slow sad hours that bring us all things ill,
  And all good things from evil, brought the night
  In which we sat together and alone,
  And to the want, that hollow'd all the heart,
  Gave utterance by the yearning of an eye,
  That burn'd upon its object thro' such tears
  As flow but once a life. The trance gave way
  To those caresses, when a hundred times
  In that last kiss, which never was the last,
  Farewell, like endless welcome, lived and died.
  Then follow'd counsel, comfort and the words
  That make a man feel strong in speaking truth;
  Till now the dark was worn, and overhead
  The lights of sunset and of sunrise mix'd
  In that brief night; the summer night, that paused
  Among her stars to hear us; stars that hung
  Love-charm'd to listen: all the wheels of Time
  Spun round in station, but the end had come.
  O then like those, who clench [4] their nerves to rush
  Upon their dissolution, we two rose,
  There-closing like an individual life--
  In one blind cry of passion and of pain,
  Like bitter accusation ev'n to death,
  Caught up the whole of love and utter'd it,
  And bade adieu for ever. Live--yet live--
  Shall sharpest pathos blight us, knowing all
  Life needs for life is possible to will--
  Live happy; tend thy flowers; be tended by
  My blessing! Should my Shadow cross thy thoughts
  Too sadly for their peace, remand it thou
  For calmer hours to Memory's darkest hold, [5]
  If not to be forgotten--not at once--
  Not all forgotten. Should it cross thy dreams,
  O might it come like one that looks content,
  With quiet eyes unfaithful to the truth,
  And point thee forward to a distant light,
  Or seem to lift a burthen from thy heart
  And leave thee freer, till thou wake refresh'd,
  Then when the first low matin-chirp hath grown
  Full quire, and morning driv'n her plow of pearl [6]
  Far furrowing into light the mounded rack,
  Beyond the fair green field and eastern sea.


[Footnote 1: As this passage is a little obscure, it may not be
superfluous to point out that "shout" is a substantive.]

[Footnote 2: The distinction between "knowledge" and "wisdom" is a
favourite one with Tennyson. See 'In Memoriam', cxiv.; 'Locksley
Hall', 141, and for the same distinction see Cowper, 'Task',
vi., 88-99.]

[Footnote 3: Suggested by Theocritus, 'Id'., xv., 104-5.]

[Footnote 4: 1842 to 1845. O then like those, that clench.]

[Footnote 5: Pathos, in the Greek sense, "suffering". All editions up to
and including 1850 have a small "s" and a small "m" for Shadow and
Memory, and read thus:--

  Too sadly for their peace, so put it back
  For calmer hours in memory's darkest hold,
  If unforgotten! should it cross thy dreams,
  So might it come, etc.]

THE GOLDEN YEAR

This poem was first published in the fourth edition of the poems 1846.
No alterations were made in it after 1851. The poem had a message for
the time at which it was written. The country was in a very troubled
state. The contest between the Protectionists and Free-traders was at
its acutest stage. The Maynooth endowment and the "godless colleges" had
brought into prominence questions of the gravest moment in religion and
education, while the Corn Bill and the Coercion Bill had inflamed the
passions of party politicians almost to madness. Tennyson, his son tells
us, entered heartily into these questions, believing that the remedies
for these distempers lay in the spread of education, a more catholic
spirit in the press, a partial adoption of Free Trade principles, and
union as far as possible among the different sections of Christianity.


  Well, you shall have that song which Leonard wrote:
  It was last summer on a tour in Wales:
  Old James was with me: we that day had been
  Up Snowdon; and I wish'd for Leonard there,
  And found him in Llanberis: [1] then we crost
  Between the lakes, and clamber'd half-way up
  The counterside; and that same song of his
  He told me; for I banter'd him, and swore
  They said he lived shut up within himself,
  A tongue-tied Poet in the feverous days,
  That, setting the _how much_ before the _how_,
  Cry, like the daughters of the horseleech, "Give, [2]
  Cram us with all," but count not me the herd!
  To which "They call me what they will," he said:
  "But I was born too late: the fair new forms,
  That float about the threshold of an age,
  Like truths of Science waiting to be caught--
  Catch me who can, and make the catcher crown'd--
  Are taken by the forelock. Let it be.
  But if you care indeed to listen, hear
  These measured words, my work of yestermorn.
  "We sleep and wake and sleep, but all things move;
  The Sun flies forward to his brother Sun;
  The dark Earth follows wheel'd in her ellipse;
  And human things returning on themselves
  Move onward, leading up the golden year.
  "Ah, tho' the times, when some new thought can bud,
  Are but as poets' seasons when they flower,
  Yet seas, that daily gain upon the shore, [3]
  Have ebb and flow conditioning their march,
  And slow and sure comes up the golden year.
  "When wealth no more shall rest in mounded heaps,
  But smit with freer light shall slowly melt
  In many streams to fatten lower lands,
  And light shall spread, and man be liker man
  Thro' all the season of the golden year.
  "Shall eagles not be eagles? wrens be wrens?
  If all the world were falcons, what of that?
  The wonder of the eagle were the less,
  But he not less the eagle. Happy days
  Roll onward, leading up the golden year.
  "Fly happy happy sails and bear the Press;
  Fly happy with the mission of the Cross;
  Knit land to land, and blowing havenward
  With silks, and fruits, and spices, clear of toll,
  Enrich the markets of the golden year.
  "But we grow old! Ah! when shall all men's good
  Be each man's rule, and universal Peace
  Lie like a shaft of light across the land,
  And like a lane of beams athwart the sea,
  Thro' all the circle of the golden year?"
  Thus far he flow'd, and ended; whereupon
  "Ah, folly!" in mimic cadence answer'd James--
  "Ah, folly! for it lies so far away.
  Not in our time, nor in our children's time,
  'Tis like the second world to us that live;
  'Twere all as one to fix our hopes on Heaven
  As on this vision of the golden year."
  With that he struck his staff against the rocks
  And broke it,--James,--you know him,--old, but full
  Of force and choler, and firm upon his feet,
  And like an oaken stock in winter woods,
  O'erflourished with the hoary clematis:
  Then added, all in heat: "What stuff is this!
  Old writers push'd the happy season back,--
  The more fools they,--we forward: dreamers both:
  You most, that in an age, when every hour
  Must sweat her sixty minutes to the death,
  Live on, God love us, as if the seedsman, rapt
  Upon the teeming harvest, should not dip [4]
  His hand into the bag: but well I know
  That unto him who works, and feels he works,
  This same grand year is ever at the doors."
  He spoke; and, high above, I heard them blast
  The steep slate-quarry, and the great echo flap
  And buffet round the hills from bluff to bluff.

  He told me, etc.]

ULYSSES

First published in 1842, no alterations were made in it subsequently.

This noble poem, which is said to have induced Sir Robert Peel to give
Tennyson his pension, was written soon after Arthur Hallam's death,
presumably therefore in 1833. "It gave my feeling," Tennyson said to his
son, "about the need of going forward and braving the struggle of life
perhaps more simply than anything in 'In Memoriam'." It is not the
'Ulysses' of Homer, nor was it suggested by the 'Odyssey'. The germ, the
spirit and the sentiment of the poem are from the twenty-sixth canto of
Dante's 'Inferno', where Ulysses in the Limbo of the Deceivers speaks
from the flame which swathes him. I give a literal version of the
passage:--

  "Neither fondness for my son nor reverence for my aged sire nor the
  due love which ought to have gladdened Penelope could conquer in me
  the ardour which I had to become experienced in the world and in human
  vice and worth. I put out into the deep open sea with but one ship and
  with that small company which had not deserted me.... I and my
  companions were old and tardy when we came to that narrow pass where
  Hercules assigned his landmarks. 'O brothers,' I said, 'who through a
  hundred thousand dangers have reached the West deny not to this the
  brief vigil of your senses that remain, experience of the unpeopled
  world beyond the sun. Consider your origin, ye were not formed to live
  like Brutes but to follow virtue and knowledge.... Night already saw
  the other pole with all its stars and ours so low that it rose not
  from the ocean floor'"

  ('Inferno', xxvi., 94-126).

But if the germ is here the expansion is Tennyson's; he has added
elaboration and symmetry, fine touches, magical images and magical
diction. There is nothing in Dante which answers to--

  Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'
  Gleams that untravell'd world, whose margin fades
  For ever and for ever when I move.

or

  It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:
  It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles,
  And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.

Of these lines well does Carlyle say what so many will feel: "These
lines do not make me weep, but there is in me what would till whole
Lacrymatorics as I read".


  It little profits that an idle king,
  By this still hearth, among these barren crags,
  Match'd with an aged wife, I mete and dole
  Unequal laws unto a savage race,
  That hoard, and sleep, and feed, and know not me.
  I cannot rest from travel: I will drink
  Life to the lees: all times I have enjoy'd
  Greatly, have suffer'd greatly, both with those
  That loved me, and alone; on shore, and when
  Thro' scudding drifts the rainy Hyades [1]
  Vext the dim sea: I am become a name;
  For always roaming with a hungry heart
  Much have I seen and known; cities of men
  And manners, climates, councils, governments, [2]
  Myself not least, but honour'd of them all;
  And drunk delight of battle with my peers,
  Far on the ringing plains of windy Troy.
  I am a part of all that I have met;
  Yet all experience is an arch wherethro'
  Gleams that untravell'd world, whose margin fades
  For ever and for ever when I move.
  How dull it is to pause, to make an end, [3]
  To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!
  As tho' to breathe were life. Life piled on life
  Were all too little, and of one to me
  Little remains: but every hour is saved
  From that eternal silence, something more,
  A bringer of new things; and vile it were
  For some three suns to store and hoard myself,
  And this gray spirit yearning in desire
  To follow knowledge, like a sinking star,
  Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.

  This is my son, mine own Telemachus, [4]
  To whom I leave the sceptre and the isle--
  Well-loved of me, discerning to fulfil
  This labour, by slow prudence to make mild
  A rugged people, and thro' soft degrees
  Subdue them to the useful and the good.
  Most blameless is he, centred in the sphere
  Of common duties, decent not to fail
  In offices of tenderness, and pay
  Meet adoration to my household gods,
  When I am gone. He works his work, I mine.
  There lies the port: the vessel puffs her sail:
  There gloom the dark broad seas. My mariners,
  Souls that have toil'd and wrought, and thought with me--
  That ever with a frolic welcome took
  The thunder and the sunshine, and opposed
  Free hearts, free foreheads--you and I are old;
  Old age hath yet his honour and his toil;
  Death closes all; but something ere the end,
  Some work of noble note, may yet be done,
  Not unbecoming men that strove with Gods.
  The lights begin to twinkle from the rocks:
  The long day wanes: the slow moon climbs: the deep
  Moans round with many voices. Come, my friends,
  'Tis not too late to seek a newer world.
  Push off, and sitting well in order smite
  The sounding furrows; for my purpose holds
  To sail beyond the sunset, and the baths
  Of all the western stars, until I die.
  It may be that the gulfs will wash us down:
  It may be we shall touch the Happy Isles, [5]
  And see the great Achilles, whom we knew.
  Tho' much is taken, much abides; and tho'
  We are not now that strength which in old days
  Moved earth and heaven; that which we are, we are;
  One equal temper of heroic hearts,
  Made weak by time and fate, but strong in will
  To strive, to seek, to find, and not to yield.



[Footnote 1: Virgil, 'AEn'., i., 748, and iii., 516.]

[Footnote 2: 'Odyssey', i., 1-4.]

[Footnote 3: 'Cf'. Shakespeare, 'Troilus and Cressida':--

  Perseverance, dear, my lord,
  Keeps honour bright: To have done, is to hang
  Quite out of fashion, like a rusty nail
  In monumental mockery.]


[Footnote 4: How admirably has Tennyson touched off the character of the
Telemachus of the 'Odyssey'.]

[Footnote 5: The Happy Isles, the 'Fortunatae Insulae' of the Romans and
the

  [Greek: ai t_on Makar_on naesoi]

of the Greeks, have been identified by geographers as those islands in
the Atlantic off the west coast of Africa; some take them to mean the
Canary Islands, the Madeira group and the Azores, while they may have
included the Cape de Verde Islands as well. What seems certain is that
these places with their soft delicious climate and lovely scenery gave
the poets an idea of a happy abode for departed spirits, and so the
conception of the _Elysian Fields_. The _loci classici_ on these abodes
are Homer, Odyssey, iv., 563 _seqq_.:--

  [Greek: alla s' es Elysion pedion kai peirata gaiaes athanatoi
  pempsousin, hothi xanthos Rhadamanthus tae per rhaeistae biotae pelei
  anthr_opoisin, ou niphetos, out' ar cheim_on polus, oute pot' ombros
  all' aiei Zephuroio ligu pneiontas aaetas _okeanos aniaesin
  anapsuchein anthr_opous.

  [But the Immortals will convey thee to the Elysian plain and the
  world's limits where is Rhadamanthus of the golden hair, where life is
  easiest for man; no snow is there, no nor no great storm, nor any
  rain, but always ocean sendeth forth the shrilly breezes of the West
  to cool and refresh men],

and Pindar, 'Olymp'., ii., 178 'seqq'., compared with the splendid
fragment at the beginning of the 'Dirges'. Elysium was afterwards placed
in the netherworld, as by Virgil. Thus, as so often the suggestion was
from the facts of geography, the rest soon became an allegorical myth,
and to attempt to identify and localise "the Happy Isles" is as great an
absurdity as to attempt to identify and localise the island of
Shakespeare's 'Tempest'.]








LOCKSLEY HALL

First published in 1842, and no alterations were made in it subsequently
to the edition of 1850; except that in the Selections published in 1865
in the third stanza the reading was "half in ruin" for "in the
distance". This poem, as Tennyson explained, was not autobiographic but
purely imaginary, "representing young life, its good side, its
deficiences and its yearnings". The poem, he added, was written in
Trochaics because the elder Hallam told him that the English people
liked that metre. The hero is a sort of preliminary sketch of the hero
in 'Maud', the position and character of each being very similar: both
are cynical and querulous, and break out into tirades against their kind
and society; both have been disappointed in love, and both find the same
remedy for their afflictions by mixing themselves with action and
becoming "one with their kind".

'Locksley Hall' was suggested, as Tennyson acknowledged, by Sir William
Jones' translation of the old Arabian Moallakat, a collection from the
works of pre-Mahommedan poets. See Sir William Jones' works, quarto
edition, vol. iv., pp. 247-57. But only one of these poems, namely the
poem of Amriolkais, could have immediately influenced him. In this the
poet supposes himself attended on a journey by a company of friends, and
they pass near a place where his mistress had lately lived, but from
which her tribe had then removed. He desires them to stop awhile, that
he may weep over the deserted remains of her tent. They comply with his
request, but exhort him to show more strength of mind, and urge two
topics of consolation, namely, that he had before been equally unhappy
and that he had enjoyed his full share of pleasures. Thus by the
recollection of his past delights his imagination is kindled and his
grief suspended. But Tennyson's chief indebtedness is rather in the
oriental colouring given to his poem, chiefly in the sentiment and
imagery. Thus in the couplet--

    Many a night I saw the Pleiads rising through the mellow shade
    Glitter like a swarm of fireflies tangl'd in a silver braid,

we are reminded of "It was the hour when the Pleiads appeared in the
firmament like the folds of a silken sash variously decked with gems".


  Comrades, leave me here a little, while as yet 'tis early morn:
  Leave me here, and when you want me, sound upon the bugle horn.

  'Tis the place, and all around it, [1] as of old, the curlews call,
  Dreary gleams [2] about the moorland flying over Locksley Hall;

  Locksley Hall, that in the distance overlooks the sandy tracts,
  And the hollow ocean-ridges roaring into cataracts.

  Many a night from yonder ivied casement, ere I went to rest,
  Did I look on great Orion sloping slowly to the West.

  Many a night I saw the Pleiads, rising thro' the mellow shade,
  Glitter like a swarm of fire-flies tangled in a silver braid.

  Here about the beach I wander'd, nourishing a youth sublime
  With the fairy tales of science, and the long result of Time;

  When the centuries behind me like a fruitful land reposed;
  When I clung to all the present for the promise that it closed:

  When I dipt into the future far as human eye could see;
  Saw the Vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be.--

  In the Spring a fuller crimson comes upon the robin's [3] breast;
  In the Spring the wanton lapwing gets himself another crest;

  In the Spring a livelier iris changes on the burnish'd dove;
  In the Spring a young man's fancy lightly turns to thoughts of love.

  Then her cheek was pale and thinner than should be for one so young,
  And her eyes on all my motions with a mute observance hung.

  And I said, "My cousin Amy, speak, and speak the truth to me,
  Trust me, cousin, all the current of my being sets to thee."

  On her pallid cheek and forehead came a colour and a light,
  As I have seen the rosy red flushing in the northern night.

  And she turn'd--her bosom shaken with a sudden storm of sighs--
  All the spirit deeply dawning in the dark of hazel eyes--

  Saying, "I have hid my feelings, fearing they should do me wrong";
  Saying, "Dost thou love me, cousin?" weeping, "I have loved thee
    long".

  Love took up the glass of Time, and turn'd it in his glowing hands;
  Every moment, lightly shaken, ran itself in golden sands. [4]

  Love took up the harp of Life, and smote on all the chords with might;
  Smote the chord of Self, that, trembling, pass'd in music out of
    sight.

  Many a morning on the moorland did we hear the copses ring,
  And her whisper throng'd my pulses with the fulness of the Spring.

  Many an evening by the waters did we watch the stately ships,
  And our spirits rush'd together at the touching of the lips. [5]

  O my cousin, shallow-hearted! O my Amy, mine no more!
  O the dreary, dreary moorland! O the barren, barren shore!

  Falser than all fancy fathoms, falser than all songs have sung,
  Puppet to a father's threat, and servile to a shrewish tongue!

  Is it well to wish thee happy?--having known me--to decline
  On a range of lower feelings and a narrower heart than mine!

  Yet it shall be: thou shalt lower to his level day by day,
  What is fine within thee growing coarse to sympathise with clay.

  As the husband is, the wife is: thou art mated with a clown,
  And the grossness of his nature will have weight to drag thee down.

  He will hold thee, when his passion shall have spent its novel force,
  Something better than his dog, a little dearer than his horse.

  What is this? his eyes are heavy: think not they are glazed with wine.
  Go to him: it is thy duty: kiss him: take his hand in thine.

  It may be my lord is weary, that his brain is overwrought:
  Soothe him with thy finer fancies, touch him with thy lighter thought.

  He will answer to the purpose, easy things to understand--
  Better thou wert dead before me, tho' I slew thee with my hand!

  Better thou and I were lying, hidden from the heart's disgrace,
  Roll'd in one another's arms, and silent in a last embrace.

  Cursed be the social wants that sin against the strength of youth!
  Cursed be the social lies that warp us from the living truth!

  Cursed be the sickly forms that err from honest Nature's rule!
  Cursed be the gold that gilds the straiten'd forehead of the fool!

  Well--'tis well that I should bluster!--Hadst thou less unworthy
    proved--
  Would to God--for I had loved thee more than ever wife was loved.

  Am I mad, that I should cherish that which bears but bitter fruit?
  I will pluck it from my bosom, tho' my heart be at the root.

  Never, tho' my mortal summers to such length of years should come
  As the many-winter'd crow that leads the clanging rookery home. [6]

  Where is comfort? in division of the records of the mind?
  Can I part her from herself, and love her, as I knew her, kind?

  I remember one that perish'd: sweetly did she speak and move:
  Such a one do I remember, whom to look it was to love.

  Can I think of her as dead, and love her for the love she bore?
  No--she never loved me truly: love is love for evermore.

  Comfort? comfort scorn'd of devils! this is truth the poet sings,
  That a sorrow's crown of sorrow [7] is remembering happier things.

  Drug thy memories, lest thou learn it, lest thy heart be put to proof,
  In the dead unhappy night, and when the rain is on the roof.

  Like a dog, he hunts in dreams, and thou art staring at the wall,
  Where the dying night-lamp flickers, and the shadows rise and fall.

  Then a hand shall pass before thee, pointing to his drunken sleep,
  To thy widow'd marriage-pillows, to the tears that thou wilt weep.

  Thou shalt hear the "Never, never," whisper'd by the phantom years,
  And a song from out the distance in the ringing of thine ears;

  And an eye shall vex thee, looking ancient kindness on thy pain.
  Turn thee, turn thee on thy pillow: get thee to thy rest again.

  Nay, but Nature brings thee solace; for a tender voice will cry,
  'Tis a purer life than thine; a lip to drain thy trouble dry.

  Baby lips will laugh me down: my latest rival brings thee rest.
  Baby fingers, waxen touches, press me from the mother's breast.

  O, the child too clothes the father with a dearness not his due.
  Half is thine and half is his: it will be worthy of the two.

  O, I see thee old and formal, fitted to thy petty part,
  With a little hoard of maxims preaching down a daughter's heart.

  "They were dangerous guides the feelings--she herself was not exempt--
  Truly, she herself had suffer'd"--Perish in thy self-contempt!

  Overlive it--lower yet--be happy! wherefore should I care,
  I myself must mix with action, lest I wither by despair.

  What is that which I should turn to, lighting upon days like these?
  Every door is barr'd with gold, and opens but to golden keys.

  Every gate is throng'd with suitors, all the markets overflow.
  I have but an angry fancy: what is that which I should do?

  I had been content to perish, falling on the foeman's ground,
  When the ranks are roll'd in vapour, and the winds are laid with
    sound.

  But the jingling of the guinea helps the hurt that Honour feels,
  And the nations do but murmur, snarling at each other's heels.

  Can I but relive in sadness? I will turn that earlier page.
  Hide me from my deep emotion, O thou wondrous Mother-Age!

  Make me feel the wild pulsation that I felt before the strife,
  When I heard my days before me, and the tumult of my life;

  Yearning for the large excitement that the coming years would yield,
  Eager-hearted as a boy when first he leaves his father's field,

  And at night along the dusky highway near and nearer drawn,
  Sees in heaven the light of London flaring like a dreary dawn; [8]

  And his spirit leaps within him to be gone before him then,
  Underneath the light he looks at, in among the throngs of men;

  Men, my brothers, men the workers, ever reaping something new:
  That which they have done but earnest of the things that they shall
    do:

  For I dipt into the future, far as human eye could see,
  Saw the vision of the world, and all the wonder that would be; [9]

  Saw the heavens fill with commerce, argosies of magic sails,
  Pilots of the purple twilight, dropping down with costly bales; [10]

  Heard the heavens fill with shouting, and there rain'd a ghastly dew
  From the nations' airy navies grappling in the central blue; [10]

  Far along the world-wide whisper of the south-wind rushing warm,
  With the standards of the peoples plunging thro' the thunderstorm;
    [10]

  Till the war-drum throbbed no longer, and the battle-flags were furl'd
  In the Parliament of man, the Federation of the world. [10]

  There the common sense of most shall hold a fretful realm in awe,
  And the kindly earth shall slumber, lapt in universal law.

  So I triumph'd, ere my passion sweeping thro' me left me dry,
  Left me with the palsied heart, and left me with the jaundiced eye;

  Eye, to which all order festers, all things here are out of joint,
  Science moves, but slowly slowly, creeping on from point to point:

  Slowly comes a hungry people, as a lion, creeping nigher, [11]
  Glares at one that nods and winks behind a slowly-dying fire.

  Yet I doubt not thro' the ages one increasing purpose runs,
  And the thoughts of men are widen'd with the process of the suns.

  What is that to him that reaps not harvest of his youthful joys,
  Tho' the deep heart of existence beat for ever like a boy's?

  Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and I linger on the shore,
  And the individual withers, and the world is more and more.

  Knowledge comes, but wisdom lingers, and he bears a laden breast,
  Full of sad experience, moving toward the stillness of his rest.

  Hark, my merry comrades call me, sounding on the bugle-horn,
  They to whom my foolish passion were a target for their scorn:

  Shall it not be scorn to me to harp on such a moulder'd string?
  I am shamed thro' all my nature to have loved so slight a thing.

  Weakness to be wroth with weakness! woman's pleasure, woman's pain--
    [12]
  Nature made them blinder motions bounded in a shallower brain:

  Woman is the lesser man, and all thy passions, match'd with mine,
  Are as moonlight unto sunlight, and as water unto wine--

  Here at least, where nature sickens, nothing. Ah, for some retreat
  Deep in yonder shining Orient, where my life began to beat;

  Where in wild Mahratta-battle fell my father evil-starr'd;--
  I was left a trampled orphan, and a selfish uncle's ward.

  Or to burst all links of habit--there to wander far away,
  On from island unto island at the gateways of the day.

  Larger constellations burning, mellow moons and happy skies,
  Breadths of tropic shade and palms in cluster, knots of Paradise. [13]

  Never comes the trader, never floats an European flag,
  Slides the bird o'er lustrous woodland, swings the trailer [14] from
    the crag;

  Droops the heavy-blossom'd bower, hangs the heavy-fruited tree--
  Summer isles of Eden lying in dark-purple spheres of sea.

  There methinks would be enjoyment more than in this march of mind,
  In the steamship, in the railway, in the thoughts that shake mankind.

  There the passions cramp'd no longer shall have scope and
    breathing-space;
  I will take some savage woman, she shall rear my dusky race.

  Iron-jointed, supple-sinew'd, they shall dive, and they shall run,
  Catch the wild goat by the hair, and hurl their lances in the sun;

  Whistle back the parrot's call, and leap the rainbows of the brooks.
  Not with blinded eyesight poring over miserable books--

  Fool, again the dream, the fancy! but I _know_ my words are wild,
  But I count the gray barbarian lower than the Christian child.

  _I_, to herd with narrow foreheads, vacant of our glorious gains, [15]
  Like a beast with lower pleasures, like a beast with lower pains!

  Mated with a squalid savage--what to me were sun or clime?
  I the heir of all the ages, in the foremost files of time--

  I that rather held it better men should perish one by one,
  Than that earth should stand at gaze like Joshua's moon in Ajalon!

  Not in vain the distance beacons. Forward, forward let us range.
  Let the great world spin [16] for ever down the ringing grooves [17]
    of change.

  Thro' the shadow of the globe [18] we sweep into the younger day:
  Better fifty years of Europe than a cycle of Cathay. [19]

  Mother-Age (for mine I knew not) help me as when life begun:
  Rift the hills, and roll the waters, flash the lightnings, weigh the
    Sun--[20]

  O, I see the crescent promise of my spirit hath not set.
  Ancient founts of inspiration well thro' all my fancy yet.

  Howsoever these things be, a long farewell to Locksley Hall!
  Now for me the woods may wither, now for me the roof-tree fall.

  Comes a vapour from the margin, blackening over heath and holt,
  Cramming all the blast before it, in its breast a thunderbolt.

  Let it fall on Locksley Hall, with rain or hail, or fire or snow;
  For the mighty wind arises, roaring seaward, and I go.

[Footnote 2: "Gleams," it appears, is a Lincolnshire word for the cry of
the curlew, and so by removing the comma after call we get an
interpretation which perhaps improves the sense and certainly gets rid
of a very un-Tennysonian cumbrousness in the second line. But Tennyson
had never, he said, heard of that meaning of "gleams," adding he wished
he had. He meant nothing more in the passage than "to express the flying
gleams of light across a dreary moorland when looking at it under
peculiarly dreary circumstances". See for this, 'Life', iii., 82.]

image, which he himself pronounced to be the best simile he had ever
made.]

Tennyson's. See 'A Narrative of a Residence in South Africa', by Thomas
Pringle, p. 39:

  "The night was extremely dark and the rain fell so heavily that in
  spite of the abundant supply of dry firewood, which we had luckily
  provided, it was not without difficulty that we could keep one
  watchfire burning.... About midnight we were suddenly roused by the
  roar of a lion close to our tents. It was so loud and tremendous that
  for the moment I actually thought that a thunderstorm had burst upon
  us.... We roused up the half-extinguished fire to a roaring blaze ...
  this unwonted display probably daunted our grim visitor, for he gave
  us no further trouble that night."]

GODIVA


First published in 1842. No alteration was made in any subsequent
edition.

The poem was written in 1840 when Tennyson was returning from Coventry
to London, after his visit to Warwickshire in that year. The Godiva
pageant takes place in that town at the great fair on Friday in Trinity
week. Earl Leofric was the Lord of Coventry in the reign of Edward the
Confessor, and he and his wife Godiva founded a magnificent Benedictine
monastery at Coventry. The first writer who mentions this legend is
Matthew of Westminster, who wrote in 1307, that is some 250 years after
Leofric's time, and what authority he had for it is not known. It is
certainly not mentioned by the many preceding writers who have left
accounts of Leofric and Godiva (see Gough's edition of Camden's
'Britannia', vol. ii., p. 346, and for a full account of the legend see
W. Reader, 'The History and Description of Coventry Show Fair, with the
History of Leofric and Godiva'). With Tennyson's should be compared
Moultrie's beautiful poem on the same subject, and Landor's Imaginary
Conversation between Leofric and Godiva.

  [1] _I waited for the train at Coventry;
  I hung with grooms and porters on the bridge,
  To match the three tall spires; [2] and there I shaped
  The city's ancient legend into this:_
  Not only we, the latest seed of Time,
  New men, that in the flying of a wheel
  Cry down the past, not only we, that prate
  Of rights and wrongs, have loved the people well,
  And loathed to see them overtax'd; but she
  Did more, and underwent, and overcame,
  The woman of a thousand summers back,
  Godiva, wife to that grim Earl, who ruled
  In Coventry: for when he laid a tax
  Upon his town, and all the mothers brought
  Their children, clamouring, "If we pay, we starve!"
  She sought her lord, and found him, where he strode
  About the hall, among his dogs, alone,
  His beard a foot before him, and his hair
  A yard behind. She told him of their tears,
  And pray'd him, "If they pay this tax, they starve".
  Whereat he stared, replying, half-amazed,
  "You would not let your little finger ache
  For such as _these?_"--"But I would die," said she.
  He laugh'd, and swore by Peter and by Paul;
  Then fillip'd at the diamond in her ear;
  "O ay, ay, ay, you talk!"--"Alas!" she said,
  "But prove me what it is I would not do."
  And from a heart as rough as Esau's hand,
  He answer'd, "Ride you naked thro' the town,
  And I repeal it"; and nodding as in scorn,
  He parted, with great strides among his dogs.
  So left alone, the passions of her mind,
  As winds from all the compass shift and blow,
  Made war upon each other for an hour,
  Till pity won. She sent a herald forth,
  And bad him cry, with sound of trumpet, all
  The hard condition; but that she would loose
  The people: therefore, as they loved her well,
  From then till noon no foot should pace the street,
  No eye look down, she passing; but that all
  Should keep within, door shut, and window barr'd.
  Then fled she to her inmost bower, and there
  Unclasp'd the wedded eagles of her belt,
  The grim Earl's gift; but ever at a breath
  She linger'd, looking like a summer moon
  Half-dipt in cloud: anon she shook her head,
  And shower'd the rippled ringlets to her knee;
  Unclad herself in haste; adown the stair
  Stole on; and, like a creeping sunbeam, slid
  From pillar unto pillar, until she reach'd
  The gateway; there she found her palfrey trapt
  In purple blazon'd with armorial gold.
  Then she rode forth, clothed on with chastity:
  The deep air listen'd round her as she rode,
  And all the low wind hardly breathed for fear.
  The little wide-mouth'd heads upon the spout
  Had cunning eyes to see: the barking cur
  Made her cheek flame: her palfrey's footfall shot
  Light horrors thro' her pulses: the blind walls
  Were full of chinks and holes; and overhead
  Fantastic gables, crowding, stared: but she
  Not less thro' all bore up, till, last, she saw
  The white-flower'd elder-thicket from the field
  Gleam thro' the Gothic archways [3]in the wall.
  Then she rode back cloth'd on with chastity:
  And one low churl, [4] compact of thankless earth,
  The fatal byword of all years to come,
  Boring a little auger-hole in fear,
  Peep'd--but his eyes, before they had their will,
  Were shrivell'd into darkness in his head,
  And dropt before him. So the Powers, who wait
  On noble deeds, cancell'd a sense misused;
  And she, that knew not, pass'd: and all at once,
  With twelve great shocks of sound, the shameless noon
  Was clash'd and hammer'd from a hundred towers, [5]
  One after one: but even then she gain'd
  Her bower; whence reissuing, robed and crown'd,
  To meet her lord, she took the tax away,
  And built herself an everlasting name.

THE TWO VOICES


First published in 1842, though begun as early as 1833 and in course of
composition in 1834. See Spedding's letter dated 19th September, 1834.
Its original title was 'The Thoughts of a Suicide'. No alterations were
made in the poem after 1842.

It adds interest to this poem to know that it is autobiographical. It
was written soon after the death of Arthur Hallam when Tennyson's
depression was deepest. "When I wrote 'The Two Voices' I was so utterly
miserable, a burden to myself and to my family, that I said, 'Is life
worth anything?'" It is the history--as Spedding put it--of the
agitations, the suggestions and counter-suggestions of a mind sunk in
hopeless despondency, and meditating self-destruction, together with the
manner of its recovery to a more healthy condition. We have two
singularly interesting parallels to it in preceding poetry. The one is
in the third book of Lucretius (830-1095), where the arguments for
suicide are urged, not merely by the poet himself, but by arguments
placed by him in the mouth of Nature herself, and urged with such
cogency that they are said to have induced one of his editors and
translators, Creech, to put an end to his life. The other is in Spenser,
in the dialogue between Despair and the Red Cross Knight, where Despair
puts the case for self-destruction, and the Red Cross Knight rebuts the
arguments ('Faerie Queene', I. ix., st. xxxviii.-liv.).


  A still small voice spake unto me,
  "Thou art so full of misery,
  Were it not better not to be?"

  Then to the still small voice I said;
  "Let me not cast in endless shade
  What is so wonderfully made".

  To which the voice did urge reply;
  "To-day I saw the dragon-fly
  Come from the wells where he did lie.

  "An inner impulse rent the veil
  Of his old husk: from head to tail
  Came out clear plates of sapphire mail.

  "He dried his wings: like gauze they grew:
  Thro' crofts and pastures wet with dew
  A living flash of light he flew."

  I said, "When first the world began
  Young Nature thro' five cycles ran,
  And in the sixth she moulded man.

  "She gave him mind, the lordliest
  Proportion, and, above the rest,
  Dominion in the head and breast."

  Thereto the silent voice replied;
  "Self-blinded are you by your pride:
  Look up thro' night: the world is wide.

  "This truth within thy mind rehearse,
  That in a boundless universe
  Is boundless better, boundless worse.

  "Think you this mould of hopes and fears
  Could find no statelier than his peers
  In yonder hundred million spheres?"

  It spake, moreover, in my mind:
  "Tho' thou wert scatter'd to the wind,
  Yet is there plenty of the kind".

  Then did my response clearer fall:
  "No compound of this earthly ball
  Is like another, all in all".

  To which he answer'd scoffingly;
  "Good soul! suppose I grant it thee,
  Who'll weep for thy deficiency?

  "Or will one beam [1] be less intense,
  When thy peculiar difference
  Is cancell'd in the world of sense?"

  I would have said, "Thou canst not know,"
  But my full heart, that work'd below,
  Rain'd thro' my sight its overflow.

  Again the voice spake unto me:
  "Thou art so steep'd in misery,
  Surely 'twere better not to be.

  "Thine anguish will not let thee sleep,
  Nor any train of reason keep:
  Thou canst not think, but thou wilt weep."

  I said, "The years with change advance:
  If I make dark my countenance,
  I shut my life from happier chance.

  "Some turn this sickness yet might take,
  Ev'n yet." But he: "What drug can make
  A wither'd palsy cease to shake?"

  I wept, "Tho' I should die, I know
  That all about the thorn will blow
  In tufts of rosy-tinted snow;

  "And men, thro' novel spheres of thought
  Still moving after truth long sought,
  Will learn new things when I am not."

  "Yet," said the secret voice, "some time,
  Sooner or later, will gray prime
  Make thy grass hoar with early rime.

  "Not less swift souls that yearn for light,
  Rapt after heaven's starry flight,
  Would sweep the tracts of day and night.

  "Not less the bee would range her cells,
  The furzy prickle fire the dells,
  The foxglove cluster dappled bells."

  I said that "all the years invent;
  Each month is various to present
  The world with some development.

  "Were this not well, to bide mine hour,
  Tho' watching from a ruin'd tower
  How grows the day of human power?"

  "The highest-mounted mind," he said,
  "Still sees the sacred morning spread
  The silent summit overhead.

  "Will thirty seasons render plain
  Those lonely lights that still remain,
  Just breaking over land and main?

  "Or make that morn, from his cold crown
  And crystal silence creeping down,
  Flood with full daylight glebe and town?

  "Forerun thy peers, thy time, and let
  Thy feet, millenniums hence, be set
  In midst of knowledge, dream'd not yet.

  "Thou hast not gain'd a real height,
  Nor art thou nearer to the light,
  Because the scale is infinite.

  "'Twere better not to breathe or speak,
  Than cry for strength, remaining weak,
  And seem to find, but still to seek.

  "Moreover, but to seem to find
  Asks what thou lackest, thought resign'd,
  A healthy frame, a quiet mind."

  I said, "When I am gone away,
  'He dared not tarry,' men will say,
  Doing dishonour to my clay."

  "This is more vile," he made reply,
  "To breathe and loathe, to live and sigh,
  Than once from dread of pain to die.

  "Sick art thou--a divided will
  Still heaping on the fear of ill
  The fear of men, a coward still.

  "Do men love thee? Art thou so bound
  To men, that how thy name may sound
  Will vex thee lying underground?

  "The memory of the wither'd leaf
  In endless time is scarce more brief
  Than of the garner'd Autumn-sheaf.

  "Go, vexed Spirit, sleep in trust;
  The right ear, that is fill'd with dust,
  Hears little of the false or just."

  "Hard task, to pluck resolve," I cried,
  "From emptiness and the waste wide
  Of that abyss, or scornful pride!

  "Nay--rather yet that I could raise
  One hope that warm'd me in the days
  While still I yearn'd for human praise.

  "When, wide in soul, and bold of tongue,
  Among the tents I paused and sung,
  The distant battle flash'd and rung.

  "I sung the joyful Paean clear,
  And, sitting, burnish'd without fear
  The brand, the buckler, and the spear--

  "Waiting to strive a happy strife,
  To war with falsehood to the knife,
  And not to lose the good of life--

  "Some hidden principle to move,
  To put together, part and prove,
  And mete the bounds of hate and love--

  "As far as might be, to carve out
  Free space for every human doubt,
  That the whole mind might orb about--

  "To search thro' all I felt or saw,
  The springs of life, the depths of awe,
  And reach the law within the law:

  "At least, not rotting like a weed,
  But, having sown some generous seed,
  Fruitful of further thought and deed,

  "To pass, when Life her light withdraws,
  Not void of righteous self-applause,
  Nor in a merely selfish cause--

  "In some good cause, not in mine own,
  To perish, wept for, honour'd, known,
  And like a warrior overthrown;

  "Whose eyes are dim with glorious tears,
  When, soil'd with noble dust, he hears
  His country's war-song thrill his ears:

  "Then dying of a mortal stroke,
  What time the foeman's line is broke.
  And all the war is roll'd in smoke." [2]

  "Yea!" said the voice, "thy dream was good,
  While thou abodest in the bud.
  It was the stirring of the blood.

  "If Nature put not forth her power [2]
  About the opening of the flower,
  Who is it that could live an hour?

  "Then comes the check, the change, the fall.
  Pain rises up, old pleasures pall.
  There is one remedy for all.

  "Yet hadst thou, thro' enduring pain,
  Link'd month to month with such a chain
  Of knitted purport, all were vain.

  "Thou hadst not between death and birth
  Dissolved the riddle of the earth.
  So were thy labour little worth.

  "That men with knowledge merely play'd,
  I told thee--hardly nigher made,
  Tho' scaling slow from grade to grade;

  "Much less this dreamer, deaf and blind,
  Named man, may hope some truth to find,
  That bears relation to the mind.

  "For every worm beneath the moon
  Draws different threads, and late and soon
  Spins, toiling out his own cocoon.

  "Cry, faint not: either Truth is born
  Beyond the polar gleam forlorn,
  Or in the gateways of the morn.

  "Cry, faint not, climb: the summits slope
  Beyond the furthest nights of hope,
  Wrapt in dense cloud from base to cope.

  "Sometimes a little corner shines,
  As over rainy mist inclines
  A gleaming crag with belts of pines.

  "I will go forward, sayest thou,
  I shall not fail to find her now.
  Look up, the fold is on her brow.

  "If straight thy track, or if oblique,
  Thou know'st not. Shadows thou dost strike,
  Embracing cloud, Ixion-like;

  "And owning but a little more
  Than beasts, abidest lame and poor,
  Calling thyself a little lower

  "Than angels. Cease to wail and brawl!
  Why inch by inch to darkness crawl?
  There is one remedy for all."

  "O dull, one-sided voice," said I,
  "Wilt thou make everything a lie,
  To flatter me that I may die?

  "I know that age to age succeeds,
  Blowing a noise of tongues and deeds,
  A dust of systems and of creeds.

  "I cannot hide that some have striven,
  Achieving calm, to whom was given
  The joy that mixes man with Heaven:

  "Who, rowing hard against the stream,
  Saw distant gates of Eden gleam,
  And did not dream it was a dream";

  "But heard, by secret transport led, [3]
  Ev'n in the charnels of the dead,
  The murmur of the fountain-head--

  "Which did accomplish their desire,--
  Bore and forbore, and did not tire,
  Like Stephen, an unquenched fire.

  "He heeded not reviling tones,
  Nor sold his heart to idle moans,
  Tho' cursed and scorn'd, and bruised with stones:

  "But looking upward, full of grace,
  He pray'd, and from a happy place
  God's glory smote him on the face."

  The sullen answer slid betwixt:
  "Not that the grounds of hope were fix'd,
  The elements were kindlier mix'd." [4]

  I said, "I toil beneath the curse,
  But, knowing not the universe,
  I fear to slide from bad to worse. [5]

  "And that, in seeking to undo
  One riddle, and to find the true,
  I knit a hundred others new:

  "Or that this anguish fleeting hence,
  Unmanacled from bonds of sense,
  Be fix'd and froz'n to permanence:

  "For I go, weak from suffering here;
  Naked I go, and void of cheer:
  What is it that I may not fear?"

  "Consider well," the voice replied,
  "His face, that two hours since hath died;
  Wilt thou find passion, pain or pride?

  "Will he obey when one commands?
  Or answer should one press his hands?
  He answers not, nor understands.

  "His palms are folded on his breast:
  There is no other thing express'd
  But long disquiet merged in rest.

  "His lips are very mild and meek:
  Tho' one should smite him on the cheek,
  And on the mouth, he will not speak.

  "His little daughter, whose sweet face
  He kiss'd, taking his last embrace,
  Becomes dishonour to her race--

  "His sons grow up that bear his name,
  Some grow to honour, some to shame,--
  But he is chill to praise or blame. [6]

  "He will not hear the north wind rave,
  Nor, moaning, household shelter crave
  From winter rains that beat his grave.

  "High up the vapours fold and swim:
  About him broods the twilight dim:
  The place he knew forgetteth him."

  "If all be dark, vague voice," I said,
  "These things are wrapt in doubt and dread,
  Nor canst thou show the dead are dead.

  "The sap dries up: the plant declines. [7]
  A deeper tale my heart divines.
  Know I not Death? the outward signs?

  "I found him when my years were few;
  A shadow on the graves I knew,
  And darkness in the village yew.

  "From grave to grave the shadow crept:
  In her still place the morning wept:
  Touch'd by his feet the daisy slept.

  "The simple senses crown'd his head: [8]
  'Omega! thou art Lord,' they
  said; 'We find no motion in the dead.'

  "Why, if man rot in dreamless ease,
  Should that plain fact, as taught by these,
  Not make him sure that he shall cease?

  "Who forged that other influence,
  That heat of inward evidence,
  By which he doubts against the sense?

  "He owns the fatal gift of eyes, [9]
  That read his spirit blindly wise,
  Not simple as a thing that dies.

  "Here sits he shaping wings to fly:
  His heart forebodes a mystery:
  He names the name Eternity.

  "That type of Perfect in his mind
  In Nature can he nowhere find.
  He sows himself in every wind.

  "He seems to hear a Heavenly Friend,
  And thro' thick veils to apprehend
  A labour working to an end.

  "The end and the beginning vex
  His reason: many things perplex,
  With motions, checks, and counterchecks.

  "He knows a baseness in his blood
  At such strange war with something good,
  He may not do the thing he would.

  "Heaven opens inward, chasms yawn.
  Vast images in glimmering dawn,
  Half shown, are broken and withdrawn.

  "Ah! sure within him and without,
  Could his dark wisdom find it out,
  There must be answer to his doubt.

  "But thou canst answer not again.
  With thine own weapon art thou slain,
  Or thou wilt answer but in vain.

  "The doubt would rest, I dare not solve.
  In the same circle we revolve.
  Assurance only breeds resolve."

  As when a billow, blown against,
  Falls back, the voice with which I fenced
  A little ceased, but recommenced.

  "Where wert thou when thy father play'd
  In his free field, and pastime made,
  A merry boy in sun and shade?

  "A merry boy they called him then.
  He sat upon the knees of men
  In days that never come again,

  "Before the little ducts began
  To feed thy bones with lime, and ran
  Their course, till thou wert also man:

  "Who took a wife, who rear'd his race,
  Whose wrinkles gather'd on his face,
  Whose troubles number with his days:

  "A life of nothings, nothing-worth,
  From that first nothing ere his birth
  To that last nothing under earth!"

  "These words," I said, "are like the rest,
  No certain clearness, but at best
  A vague suspicion of the breast:

  "But if I grant, thou might'st defend
  The thesis which thy words intend--
  That to begin implies to end;

  "Yet how should I for certain hold, [10]
  Because my memory is so cold,
  That I first was in human mould?

  "I cannot make this matter plain,
  But I would shoot, howe'er in vain,
  A random arrow from the brain.

  "It may be that no life is found,
  Which only to one engine bound
  Falls off, but cycles always round.

  "As old mythologies relate,
  Some draught of Lethe might await
  The slipping thro' from state to state.

  "As here we find in trances, men
  Forget the dream that happens then,
  Until they fall in trance again.

  "So might we, if our state were such
  As one before, remember much,
  For those two likes might meet and touch. [11]

  "But, if I lapsed from nobler place,
  Some legend of a fallen race
  Alone might hint of my disgrace;

  "Some vague emotion of delight
  In gazing up an Alpine height,
  Some yearning toward the lamps of night.

  "Or if thro' lower lives I came--
  Tho' all experience past became
  Consolidate in mind and frame--

  "I might forget my weaker lot;
  For is not our first year forgot?
  The haunts of memory echo not.

  "And men, whose reason long was blind,
  From cells of madness unconfined, [12]
  Oft lose whole years of darker mind.

  "Much more, if first I floated free,
  As naked essence, must I be
  Incompetent of memory:

  "For memory dealing but with time,
  And he with matter, could she climb
  Beyond her own material prime?

  "Moreover, something is or seems,
  That touches me with mystic gleams,
  Like glimpses of forgotten dreams--

  "Of something felt, like something here;
  Of something done, I know not where;
  Such as no language may declare."

  The still voice laugh'd. "I talk," said he,
  "Not with thy dreams.
  Suffice it thee Thy pain is a reality."

  "But thou," said I, "hast miss'd thy mark,
  Who sought'st to wreck my mortal ark,
  By making all the horizon dark.

  "Why not set forth, if I should do
  This rashness, that which might ensue
  With this old soul in organs new?

  "Whatever crazy sorrow saith,
  No life that breathes with human breath
  Has ever truly long'd for death.

  "'Tis life, whereof our nerves are scant,
  Oh life, not death, for which we pant;
  More life, and fuller, that I want."

  I ceased, and sat as one forlorn.
  Then said the voice, in quiet scorn,
  "Behold it is the Sabbath morn".

  And I arose, and I released
  The casement, and the light increased
  With freshness in the dawning east.

  Like soften'd airs that blowing steal,
  When meres begin to uncongeal,
  The sweet church bells began to peal.

  On to God's house the people prest:
  Passing the place where each must rest,
  Each enter'd like a welcome guest.

  One walk'd between his wife and child,
  With measur'd footfall firm and mild,
  And now and then he gravely smiled.

  The prudent partner of his blood
  Lean'd on him, faithful, gentle, good, [13]
  Wearing the rose of womanhood.

  And in their double love secure,
  The little maiden walk'd demure,
  Pacing with downward eyelids pure.

  These three made unity so sweet,
  My frozen heart began to beat,
  Remembering its ancient heat.

  I blest them, and they wander'd on:
  I spoke, but answer came there none:
  The dull and bitter voice was gone.

  A second voice was at mine ear,
  A little whisper silver-clear,
  A murmur, "Be of better cheer".

  As from some blissful neighbourhood,
  A notice faintly understood,
  "I see the end, and know the good".

  A little hint to solace woe,
  A hint, a whisper breathing low,
  "I may not speak of what I know".

  Like an Aeolian harp that wakes
  No certain air, but overtakes
  Far thought with music that it makes:

  Such seem'd the whisper at my side:
  "What is it thou knowest, sweet voice?" I cried.
  "A hidden hope," the voice replied:

  So heavenly-toned, that in that hour
  From out my sullen heart a power
  Broke, like the rainbow from the shower,

  To feel, altho' no tongue can prove
  That every cloud, that spreads above
  And veileth love, itself is love.

  And forth into the fields I went,
  And Nature's living motion lent
  The pulse of hope to discontent.

  I wonder'd at the bounteous hours,
  The slow result of winter showers:
  You scarce could see the grass for flowers.

  I wonder'd, while I paced along:
  The woods were fill'd so full with song,
  There seem'd no room for sense of wrong.

  So variously seem'd all things wrought, [14]
  I marvell'd how the mind was brought
  To anchor by one gloomy thought;

  And wherefore rather I made choice
  To commune with that barren voice,
  Than him that said, "Rejoice! rejoice!"

'Intimations of Immortality':--

There is a close parallel between the former and the latter state
described here and in Coleridge's mystic allegory; in both cases the
sufferers "wake to love," the curse falling off them when they can
"bless".]

THE DAY-DREAM

First published in 1842, but written in 1835. In it is incorporated,
though with several alterations, 'The Sleeping Beauty', published among
the poems of 1830, but excised in subsequent editions. Half extravaganza
and half apologue, like the 'Midsummer Night's Dream', this delightful
poem may be safely left to deliver its own message and convey its own
meaning. It is an excellent illustration of the truth of Tennyson's own
remark: "Poetry is like shot silk with many glancing colours. Every
reader must find his own interpretation according to his ability, and
according to his sympathy with the poet."

  PROLOGUE

  (No alteration has been made in the Prologue since 1842.)


    O, Lady Flora, let me speak:
    A pleasant hour has past away
    While, dreaming on your damask cheek,
    The dewy sister-eyelids lay.

    As by the lattice you reclined,
    I went thro' many wayward moods
    To see you dreaming--and, behind,
    A summer crisp with shining woods.
    And I too dream'd, until at last
    Across my fancy, brooding warm,
    The reflex of a legend past,
    And loosely settled into form.
    And would you have the thought I had,
    And see the vision that I saw,
    Then take the broidery-frame, and add
    A crimson to the quaint Macaw,
    And I will tell it. Turn your face,
    Nor look with that too-earnest eye--
    The rhymes are dazzled from their place,
    And order'd words asunder fly.



  THE SLEEPING PALACE


  (No alteration since 1851.)


    1

    The varying year with blade and sheaf
    Clothes and reclothes the happy plains;
    Here rests the sap within the leaf,
    Here stays the blood along the veins.
    Faint shadows, vapours lightly curl'd,
    Faint murmurs from the meadows come,
    Like hints and echoes of the world
    To spirits folded in the womb.


    2

    Soft lustre bathes the range of urns
    On every slanting terrace-lawn.
    The fountain to his place returns
    Deep in the garden lake withdrawn.
    Here droops the banner on the tower,
    On the hall-hearths the festal fires,
    The peacock in his laurel bower,
    The parrot in his gilded wires.


    3

    Roof-haunting martins warm their eggs:
    In these, in those the life is stay'd.
    The mantles from the golden pegs
    Droop sleepily: no sound is made,
    Not even of a gnat that sings.
    More like a picture seemeth all
    Than those old portraits of old kings,
    That watch the sleepers from the wall.


    4

    Here sits the Butler with a flask
    Between his knees, half-drain'd; and there
    The wrinkled steward at his task,
    The maid-of-honour blooming fair:
    The page has caught her hand in his:
    Her lips are sever'd as to speak:
    His own are pouted to a kiss:
    The blush is fix'd upon her cheek.


    5

    Till all the hundred summers pass,
    The beams, that thro' the Oriel shine,
    Make prisms in every carven glass,
    And beaker brimm'd with noble wine.
    Each baron at the banquet sleeps,
    Grave faces gather'd in a ring.
    His state the king reposing keeps.
    He must have been a jovial king. [1]


    6

    All round a hedge upshoots, and shows
    At distance like a little wood;
    Thorns, ivies, woodbine, misletoes,
    And grapes with bunches red as blood;
    All creeping plants, a wall of green
    Close-matted, bur and brake and briar,
    And glimpsing over these, just seen,
    High up, the topmost palace-spire.


    7

    When will the hundred summers die,
    And thought and time be born again,
    And newer knowledge, drawing nigh,
    Bring truth that sways the soul of men?
    Here all things in there place remain,
    As all were order'd, ages since.
    Come, Care and Pleasure, Hope and Pain,
    And bring the fated fairy Prince.


[Footnote 1: All editions up to and including 1851:--He must have been
a jolly king.]



  THE SLEEPING BEAUTY


  (First printed in 1830, but does not reappear again till 1842. No
  alteration since 1842.)


    1

    Year after year unto her feet,
    She lying on her couch alone,
    Across the purpled coverlet,
    The maiden's jet-black hair has grown, [1]
    On either side her tranced form
    Forth streaming from a braid of pearl:
    The slumbrous light is rich and warm,
    And moves not on the rounded curl.


    2

    The silk star-broider'd [2] coverlid
    Unto her limbs itself doth mould
    Languidly ever; and, amid
    Her full black ringlets downward roll'd,
    Glows forth each softly-shadow'd arm,
    With bracelets of the diamond bright:
    Her constant beauty doth inform
    Stillness with love, and day with light.


    3

    She sleeps: her breathings are not heard
    In palace chambers far apart. [3]
    The fragrant tresses are not stirr'd
    That lie upon her charmed heart.
    She sleeps: on either hand [4] upswells
    The gold-fringed pillow lightly prest:
    She sleeps, nor dreams, but ever dwells
    A perfect form in perfect rest.



[Footnote 1: 1830.

  The while she slumbereth alone,
  _Over_ the purple coverlet,
  The maiden's jet-black hair hath grown.]


[Footnote 2: 1830. Star-braided.]

[Footnote 3: A writer in 'Notes and Queries', February, 1880, asks
whether these lines mean that the lovely princess did _not_ snore
so loud that she could be heard from one end of the palace to the other
and whether it would not have detracted from her charms had that state
of things been habitual. This brings into the field Dr. Gatty and other
admirers of Tennyson, who, it must be owned, are not very successful in
giving a satisfactory reply.]

[Footnote 4: 1830. Side.]




  THE ARRIVAL


  (No alteration after 1853.)


    1

    All precious things, discover'd late,
    To those that seek them issue forth;
    For love in sequel works with fate,
    And draws the veil from hidden worth.
    He travels far from other skies
    His mantle glitters on the rocks--
    A fairy Prince, with joyful eyes,
    And lighter footed than the fox.


    2

    The bodies and the bones of those
    That strove in other days to pass,
    Are wither'd in the thorny close,
    Or scatter'd blanching on [1] the grass.
    He gazes on the silent dead:
    "They perish'd in their daring deeds."
    This proverb flashes thro' his head,
    "The many fail: the one succeeds".


    3

    He comes, scarce knowing what he seeks:
    He breaks the hedge: he enters there:
    The colour flies into his cheeks:
    He trusts to light on something fair;
    For all his life the charm did talk
    About his path, and hover near
    With words of promise in his walk,
    And whisper'd voices at his ear. [2]


    4

    More close and close his footsteps wind;
    The Magic Music [3] in his heart
    Beats quick and quicker, till he find
    The quiet chamber far apart.
    His spirit flutters like a lark,
    He stoops--to kiss her--on his knee.
    "Love, if thy tresses be so dark,
    How dark those hidden eyes must be!



[Footnote 1: 1842 to 1851. In.]

[Footnote 2: All editions up to and including 1850. In his ear.]

[Footnote 3: All editions up to and including 1851. Not capitals in
magic music.]





  THE REVIVAL


  No alteration after 1853.


    1

    A touch, a kiss! the charm was snapt.
    There rose a noise of striking clocks,
    And feet that ran, and doors that clapt,
    And barking dogs, and crowing cocks;
    A fuller light illumined all,
    A breeze thro' all the garden swept,
    A sudden hubbub shook the hall,
    And sixty feet the fountain leapt.


    2

    The hedge broke in, the banner blew,
    The butler drank, the steward scrawl'd,
    The fire shot up, the martin flew,
    The parrot scream'd, the peacock squall'd,
    The maid and page renew'd their strife,
    The palace bang'd, and buzz'd and clackt,
    And all the long-pent stream of life
    Dash'd downward in a cataract.


    3

    And last with these [1] the king awoke,
    And in his chair himself uprear'd,
    And yawn'd, and rubb'd his face, and spoke,
    "By holy rood, a royal beard!
    How say you? we have slept, my lords,
    My beard has grown into my lap."
    The barons swore, with many words,
    'Twas but an after-dinner's nap.


    4

    "Pardy," return'd the king, "but still
    My joints are something [2] stiff or so.
    My lord, and shall we pass the bill
    I mention'd half an hour ago?"
    The chancellor, sedate and vain,
    In courteous words return'd reply:
    But dallied with his golden chain,
    And, smiling, put the question by.



[Footnote 1: 1842 to 1851. And last of all.]

[Footnote 2: 1863. Somewhat.]




  THE DEPARTURE


  (No alteration since 1842.)


    1

    And on her lover's arm she leant,
    And round her waist she felt it fold,
    And far across the hills they went
    In that new world which is the old:
    Across the hills and far away
    Beyond their utmost purple rim,
    And deep into the dying day
    The happy princess follow'd him.


    2

    "I'd sleep another hundred years,
    O love, for such another kiss;"
    "O wake for ever, love," she hears,
    "O love, 'twas such as this and this."
    And o'er them many a sliding star,
    And many a merry wind was borne,
    And, stream'd thro' many a golden bar,
    The twilight melted into morn.


    3

    "O eyes long laid in happy sleep!"
    "O happy sleep, that lightly fled!"
    "O happy kiss, that woke thy sleep!"
    "O love, thy kiss would wake the dead!"
    And o'er them many a flowing range
    Of vapour buoy'd the crescent-bark,
    And, rapt thro' many a rosy change,
    The twilight died into the dark.


    4

    "A hundred summers! can it be?
    And whither goest thou, tell me where?"
    "O seek my father's court with me!
    For there are greater wonders there."
    And o'er the hills, and far away
    Beyond their utmost purple rim,
    Beyond the night across the day,
    Thro' all the world she follow'd him.




  MORAL

  (No alteration since 1842.)


    1

    So, Lady Flora, take my lay,
    And if you find no moral there,
    Go, look in any glass and say,
    What moral is in being fair.
    Oh, to what uses shall we put
    The wildweed-flower that simply blows?
    And is there any moral shut
    Within the bosom of the rose?


    2

    But any man that walks the mead,
    In bud or blade, or bloom, may find,
    According as his humours lead,
    A meaning suited to his mind.
    And liberal applications lie
    In Art like Nature, dearest friend; [1]
    So 'twere to cramp its use, if I
    Should hook it to some useful end.


[Foonote 1: So Wordsworth:--

  O Reader! had you in your mind
  Such stores as silent thought can bring,
  O gentle Reader! you would find
  A tale in everything.

  L'ENVOI


  (No alteration since 1843 except in numbering the stanzas.)

    1

    You shake your head. A random string
    Your finer female sense offends.
    Well--were it not a pleasant thing
    To fall asleep with all one's friends;
    To pass with all our social ties
    To silence from the paths of men;
    And every hundred years to rise
    And learn the world, and sleep again;
    To sleep thro' terms of mighty wars,
    And wake on science grown to more,
    On secrets of the brain, the stars,
    As wild as aught of fairy lore;
    And all that else the years will show,
    The Poet-forms of stronger hours,
    The vast Republics that may grow,
    The Federations and the Powers;
    Titanic forces taking birth
    In divers seasons, divers climes;
    For we are Ancients of the earth,
    And in the morning of the times.


    2

    So sleeping, so aroused from sleep
    Thro' sunny decads new and strange,
    Or gay quinquenniads would we reap
    The flower and quintessence of change.


    3

    Ah, yet would I--and would I might!
    So much your eyes my fancy take--
    Be still the first to leap to light
    That I might kiss those eyes awake!
    For, am I right or am I wrong,
    To choose your own you did not care;
    You'd have 'my' moral from the song,
    And I will take my pleasure there:
    And, am I right or am I wrong,
    My fancy, ranging thro' and thro',
    To search a meaning for the song,
    Perforce will still revert to you;
    Nor finds a closer truth than this
    All-graceful head, so richly curl'd,
    And evermore a costly kiss
    The prelude to some brighter world.



    4

    For since the time when Adam first
    Embraced his Eve in happy hour,
    And every bird of Eden burst
    In carol, every bud to flower,
    What eyes, like thine, have waken'd hopes?
    What lips, like thine, so sweetly join'd?
    Where on the double rosebud droops
    The fullness of the pensive mind;
    Which all too dearly self-involved, [1]
    Yet sleeps a dreamless sleep to me;
    A sleep by kisses undissolved,
    That lets thee [2] neither hear nor see:
    But break it. In the name of wife,
    And in the rights that name may give,
    Are clasp'd the moral of thy life,
    And that for which I care to live.


[Foonote 1: 1842. The pensive mind that, self-involved.]

[Foonote 2: 1842. Which lets thee.]



  EPILOGUE


  (No alteration since 1842.)

    So, Lady Flora, take my lay,
    And, if you find a meaning there,
    O whisper to your glass, and say,
    "What wonder, if he thinks me fair?"
    What wonder I was all unwise,
    To shape the song for your delight
    Like long-tail'd birds of Paradise,
    That float thro' Heaven, and cannot light?
    Or old-world trains, upheld at court
    By Cupid-boys of blooming hue--
    But take it--earnest wed with sport,
    And either sacred unto you.







AMPHION


First published in 1842. No alteration since 1850.

In this humorous allegory the poet bewails his unhappy lot on having
fallen on an age so unpropitious to poetry, contrasting it with the
happy times so responsive to his predecessors who piped to a world
prepared to dance to their music. However, he must toil and be satisfied
if he can make a little garden blossom.


  My father left a park to me,
  But it is wild and barren,
  A garden too with scarce a tree
  And waster than a warren:
  Yet say the neighbours when they call,
  It is not bad but good land,
  And in it is the germ of all
  That grows within the woodland.

  O had I lived when song was great
  In days of old Amphion, [1]
  And ta'en my fiddle to the gate,
  Nor cared for seed or scion!
  And had I lived when song was great,
  And legs of trees were limber,
  And ta'en my fiddle to the gate,
  And fiddled in the timber!

  'Tis said he had a tuneful tongue,
  Such happy intonation,
  Wherever he sat down and sung
  He left a small plantation;
  Wherever in a lonely grove
  He set up his forlorn pipes,
  The gouty oak began to move,
  And flounder into hornpipes.

  The mountain stirr'd its bushy crown,
  And, as tradition teaches,
  Young ashes pirouetted down
  Coquetting with young beeches;
  And briony-vine and ivy-wreath
  Ran forward to his rhyming,
  And from the valleys underneath
  Came little copses climbing.

  The linden broke her ranks and rent
  The woodbine wreathes that bind her,
  And down the middle, buzz! she went,
  With all her bees behind her. [2]
  The poplars, in long order due,
  With cypress promenaded,
  The shock-head willows two and two
  By rivers gallopaded.

  The birch-tree swang her fragrant hair,
  The bramble cast her berry,
  The gin within the juniper
  Began to make him merry.

  Came wet-shot alder from the wave,
  Came yews, a dismal coterie;
  Each pluck'd his one foot from the grave,
  Poussetting with a sloe-tree:
  Old elms came breaking from the vine,
  The vine stream'd out to follow,
  And, sweating rosin, plump'd the pine
  From many a cloudy hollow.

  And wasn't it a sight to see
  When, ere his song was ended,
  Like some great landslip, tree by tree,
  The country-side descended;
  And shepherds from the mountain-caves
  Look'd down, half-pleased, half-frighten'd,
  As dash'd about the drunken leaves
  The random sunshine lighten'd!

  Oh, nature first was fresh to men,
  And wanton without measure;
  So youthful and so flexile then,
  You moved her at your pleasure.
  Twang out, my fiddle! shake the twigs!
  And make her dance attendance;
  Blow, flute, and stir the stiff-set sprigs,
  And scirrhous roots and tendons.

  'Tis vain! in such a brassy age
  I could not move a thistle;
  The very sparrows in the hedge
  Scarce answer to my whistle;
  Or at the most, when three-parts-sick
  With strumming and with scraping,
  A jackass heehaws from the rick,
  The passive oxen gaping.

  But what is that I hear? a sound
  Like sleepy counsel pleading:
  O Lord!--'tis in my neighbour's ground,
  The modern Muses reading.
  They read Botanic Treatises.
  And works on Gardening thro' there,
  And Methods of transplanting trees
  To look as if they grew there.

  The wither'd Misses! how they prose
  O'er books of travell'd seamen,
  And show you slips of all that grows
  From England to Van Diemen.
  They read in arbours clipt and cut,
  And alleys, faded places,
  By squares of tropic summer shut
  And warm'd in crystal cases.

  But these, tho' fed with careful dirt,
  Are neither green nor sappy;
  Half-conscious of the garden-squirt,
  The spindlings look unhappy, [3]
  Better to me the meanest weed
  That blows upon its mountain,
  The vilest herb that runs to seed
  Beside its native fountain.

  And I must work thro' months of toil,
  And years of cultivation,
  Upon my proper patch of soil
  To grow my own plantation.
  I'll take the showers as they fall,
  I will not vex my bosom:
  Enough if at the end of all
  A little garden blossom.


[Foonote 1: Amphion was no doubt capable of performing all the feats
here attributed to him, but there is no record of them; he appears to
have confined himself to charming the stones into their places when
Thebes was being built. Tennyson seems to have confounded him with
Orpheus.]

[Footnote 2: Till 1857 these four lines ran thus:--

  The birch-tree swang her fragrant hair,
  The bramble cast her berry.
  The gin within the juniper
  Began to make him merry.]


[Footnote 3: All editions up to and including 1850. The poor things look
unhappy.]







ST. AGNES


This exquisite little poem was first published in 1837 in the
'Keepsake', an annual edited by Lady Emmeline Stuart Wortley, and was
included in the edition of 1842. No alteration has been made in it since
1842.

In 1857 the title was altered from "St. Agnes" to "St. Agnes' Eve," thus
bringing it near to Keats' poem, which certainly influenced Tennyson in
writing it, as a comparison of the opening of the two poems will show.
The saint from whom the poem takes its name was a young girl of thirteen
who suffered martyrdom in the reign of Diocletian: she is a companion to
Sir Galahad.


  Deep on the convent-roof the snows
  Are sparkling to the moon:
  My breath to heaven like vapour goes:
  May my soul follow soon!
  The shadows of the convent-towers
  Slant down the snowy sward,
  Still creeping with the creeping hours
  That lead me to my Lord:
  Make Thou [1] my spirit pure and clear
  As are the frosty skies,
  Or this first snowdrop of the year
  That in [2] my bosom lies.

  As these white robes are soiled and dark,
  To yonder shining ground;
  As this pale taper's earthly spark,
  To yonder argent round;
  So shows my soul before the Lamb,
  My spirit before Thee;
  So in mine earthly house I am,
  To that I hope to be.
  Break up the heavens, O Lord! and far,
  Thro' all yon starlight keen,
  Draw me, thy bride, a glittering star,
  In raiment white and clean.

  He lifts me to the golden doors;
  The flashes come and go;
  All heaven bursts her starry floors,
  And strows [3] her lights below,
  And deepens on and up! the gates
  Roll back, and far within
  For me the Heavenly Bridegroom waits, [4]
  To make me pure of sin. [5]
  The sabbaths of Eternity,
  One sabbath deep and wide--
  A light upon the shining sea--
  The Bridegroom [6] with his bride!

SIR GALAHAD

Published in 1842. No alteration has been made in it since. This poem
may be regarded as a prelude to 'The Holy Grail'. The character of
Galahad is deduced principally from the seventeenth book of the 'Morte
d'Arthur'. In the twenty-second chapter of that book St. Joseph of
Arimathea says to him: "Thou hast resembled me in two things in that
thou hast seen the marvels of the sangreal, and in that thou has been a
clean maiden".


  My good blade carves the casques of men,
  My tough lance thrusteth sure,
  My strength is as the strength of ten,
  Because my heart is pure.

  The shattering trumpet shrilleth high,
  The hard brands shiver on the steel,
  The splinter'd spear-shafts crack and fly,
  The horse and rider reel:

  They reel, they roll in clanging lists,
  And when the tide of combat stands,
  Perfume and flowers fall in showers,
  That lightly rain from ladies' hands.

  How sweet are looks that ladies bend
  On whom their favours fall!
  For them I battle till the end,
  To save from shame and thrall:
  But all my heart is drawn above,
  My knees are bow'd in crypt and shrine:
  I never felt the kiss of love,
  Nor maiden's hand in mine.
  More bounteous aspects on me beam,
  Me mightier transports move and thrill;
  So keep I fair thro' faith and prayer
  A virgin heart in work and will.

  When down the stormy crescent goes,
  A light before me swims,
  Between dark stems the forest glows,
  I hear a noise of hymns:
  Then by some secret shrine I ride;
  I hear a voice, but none are there;
  The stalls are void, the doors are wide,
  The tapers burning fair.
  Fair gleams the snowy altar-cloth,
  The silver vessels sparkle clean,
  The shrill bell rings, the censer swings,
  And solemn chaunts resound between.

  Sometimes on lonely mountain-meres
  I find a magic bark;
  I leap on board: no helmsman steers:
  I float till all is dark.
  A gentle sound, an awful light!
  Three angels bear the holy Grail:
  With folded feet, in stoles of white,
  On sleeping wings they sail.
  Ah, blessed vision! blood of God!
  My spirit beats her mortal bars,
  As down dark tides the glory slides,
  And star-like mingles with the stars.

  When on my goodly charger borne
  Thro' dreaming towns I go,
  The cock crows ere the Christmas morn,
  The streets are dumb with snow.
  The tempest crackles on the leads,
  And, ringing, spins from brand and mail;
  But o'er the dark a glory spreads,
  And gilds the driving hail.
  I leave the plain, I climb the height;
  No branchy thicket shelter yields;
  But blessed forms in whistling storms
  Fly o'er waste fens and windy fields.

  A maiden knight--to me is given
  Such hope, I know not fear;
  I yearn to breathe the airs of heaven
  That often meet me here.
  I muse on joy that will not cease,
  Pure spaces clothed in living beams,
  Pure lilies of eternal peace,
  Whose odours haunt my dreams;
  And, stricken by an angel's hand,
  This mortal armour that I wear,
  This weight and size, this heart and eyes,
  Are touch'd, are turn'd to finest air.

  The clouds are broken in the sky,
  And thro' the mountain-walls
  A rolling organ-harmony
  Swells up, and shakes and falls.
  Then move the trees, the copses nod,
  Wings flutter, voices hover clear:
  "O just and faithful knight of God!
  Ride on! the prize is near".
  So pass I hostel, hall, and grange;
  By bridge and ford, by park and pale,
  All-arm'd I ride, whate'er betide,
  Until I find the holy Grail.









EDWARD GRAY

First published in 1842 but written in or before 1840. See 'Life', i.,
209. Not altered since.


  Sweet Emma Moreland of yonder town
  Met me walking on yonder way,
  "And have you lost your heart?" she said;
  "And are you married yet, Edward Gray?"

  Sweet Emma Moreland spoke to me:
  Bitterly weeping I turn'd away:
  "Sweet Emma Moreland, love no more
  Can touch the heart of Edward Gray.

  "Ellen Adair she loved me well,
  Against her father's and mother's will:
  To-day I sat for an hour and wept,
  By Ellen's grave, on the windy hill.

  "Shy she was, and I thought her cold;
  Thought her proud, and fled over the sea;
  Fill'd I was with folly and spite,
  When Ellen Adair was dying for me.

  "Cruel, cruel the words I said!
  Cruelly came they back to-day:
  'You're too slight and fickle,' I said,
  'To trouble the heart of Edward Gray'.

  "There I put my face in the grass--
  Whisper'd, 'Listen to my despair:
  I repent me of all I did:
  Speak a little, Ellen Adair!'

  "Then I took a pencil, and wrote
  On the mossy stone, as I lay,
  'Here lies the body of Ellen Adair;
  And here the heart of Edward Gray!'

  "Love may come, and love may go,
  And fly, like a bird, from tree to tree:
  But I will love no more, no more,
  Till Ellen Adair come back to me.

  "Bitterly wept I over the stone:
  Bitterly weeping I turn'd away;
  There lies the body of Ellen Adair!
  And there the heart of Edward Gray!"







WILL WATERPROOF'S LYRICAL MONOLOGUE

MADE AT THE COCK

First published 1842. The final text was that of 1853, which has not
been altered since, except that in stanza 29 the two "we's" in the first
line and the "thy" in the third line are not in later editions
italicised. The Cock Tavern, No. 201 Fleet Street, on the north side of
Fleet Street, stood opposite the Temple and was of great antiquity,
going back nearly 300 years. Strype, bk. iv., h. 117, describes it as "a
noted public-house," and Pepys' 'Diary', 23rd April, 1668, speaks of
himself as having been "mighty merry there". The old carved
chimney-piece was of the age of James I., and the gilt bird over the
portal was the work of Grinling Gibbons. When Tennyson wrote this poem
it was the favourite resort of templars, journalists and literary people
generally, as it had long been. But the old place is now a thing of the
past. On the evening of 10th April, 1886, it closed its doors for ever
after an existence of nearly 300 years. There is an admirable
description of it, signed A. J. M., in 'Notes and Queries', seventh
series, vol. i., 442-6. I give a short extract:

  "At the end of a long room beyond the skylight which, except a feeble
  side window, was its only light in the daytime, was a door that led
  past a small lavatory and up half a dozen narrow steps to the kitchen,
  one of the strangest and grimmest old kitchens you ever saw. Across a
  mighty hatch, thronged with dishes, you looked into it and beheld
  there the white-jacketed man-cook, served by his two robust and
  red-armed kitchen maids. For you they were preparing chops, pork chops
  in winter, lamb chops in spring, mutton chops always, and steaks and
  sausages, and kidneys and potatoes, and poached eggs and Welsh
  rabbits, and stewed cheese, the special glory of the house. That was
  the 'menu' and men were the only guests. But of late years, as
  innovations often precede a catastrophe, two new things were
  introduced, vegetables and women. Both were respectable and both were
  good, but it was felt, especially by the virtuous Smurthwaite, that
  they were 'de trop' in a place so masculine and so carnivorous."





  O plump head-waiter at The Cock,
  To which I most resort,
  How goes the time? 'Tis five o'clock.
  Go fetch a pint of port:
  But let it not be such as that
  You set before chance-comers,
  But such whose father-grape grew fat
  On Lusitanian summers.

  No vain libation to the Muse,
  But may she still be kind,
  And whisper lovely words, and use
  Her influence on the mind,
  To make me write my random rhymes,
  Ere they be half-forgotten;
  Nor add and alter, many times,
  Till all be ripe and rotten.

  I pledge her, and she comes and dips
  Her laurel in the wine,
  And lays it thrice upon my lips,
  These favour'd lips of mine;
  Until the charm have power to make
  New life-blood warm the bosom,
  And barren commonplaces break
  In full and kindly [1] blossom.

  I pledge her silent at the board;
  Her gradual fingers steal
  And touch upon the master-chord
  Of all I felt and feel.
  Old wishes, ghosts of broken plans,
  And phantom hopes assemble;
  And that child's heart within the man's
  Begins to move and tremble.

  Thro' many an hour of summer suns
  By many pleasant ways,
  Against its fountain upward runs
  The current of my days: [2]
  I kiss the lips I once have kiss'd;
  The gas-light wavers dimmer;
  And softly, thro' a vinous mist,
  My college friendships glimmer.

  I grow in worth, and wit, and sense,
  Unboding critic-pen,
  Or that eternal want of pence,
  Which vexes public men,
  Who hold their hands to all, and cry
  For that which all deny them--
  Who sweep the crossings, wet or dry,
  And all the world go by them.

  Ah yet, tho' [3] all the world forsake,
  Tho' [3] fortune clip my wings,
  I will not cramp my heart, nor take
  Half-views of men and things.
  Let Whig and Tory stir their blood;
  There must be stormy weather;
  But for some true result of good
  All parties work together.

  Let there be thistles, there are grapes;
  If old things, there are new;
  Ten thousand broken lights and shapes,
  Yet glimpses of the true.
  Let raffs be rife in prose and rhyme,
  We lack not rhymes and reasons,
  As on this whirligig of Time [4]
  We circle with the seasons.

  This earth is rich in man and maid;
  With fair horizons bound:
  This whole wide earth of light and shade
  Comes out, a perfect round.
  High over roaring Temple-bar,
  And, set in Heaven's third story,
  I look at all things as they are,
  But thro' a kind of glory.

  Head-waiter, honour'd by the guest
  Half-mused, or reeling-ripe,
  The pint, you brought me, was the best
  That ever came from pipe.
  But tho' [3] the port surpasses praise,
  My nerves have dealt with stiffer.
  Is there some magic in the place?
  Or do my peptics differ?

  For since I came to live and learn,
  No pint of white or red
  Had ever half the power to turn
  This wheel within my head,

  Which bears a season'd brain about,
  Unsubject to confusion,
  Tho' [3] soak'd and saturate, out and out,
  Thro' every convolution.

  For I am of a numerous house,
  With many kinsmen gay,
  Where long and largely we carouse
  As who shall say me nay:
  Each month, a birthday coming on,
  We drink defying trouble,
  Or sometimes two would meet in one,
  And then we drank it double;

  Whether the vintage, yet unkept,
  Had relish, fiery-new,
  Or, elbow-deep in sawdust, slept,
  As old as Waterloo;
  Or stow'd (when classic Canning died)
  In musty bins and chambers,
  Had cast upon its crusty side
  The gloom of ten Decembers.

  The Muse, the jolly Muse, it is!
  She answer'd to my call,
  She changes with that mood or this,
  Is all-in-all to all:
  She lit the spark within my throat,
  To make my blood run quicker,
  Used all her fiery will, and smote
  Her life into the liquor.

  And hence this halo lives about
  The waiter's hands, that reach
  To each his perfect pint of stout,
  His proper chop to each.
  He looks not like the common breed
  That with the napkin dally;
  I think he came like Ganymede,
  From some delightful valley.

  The Cock was of a larger egg
  Than modern poultry drop,
  Stept forward on a firmer leg,
  And cramm'd a plumper crop;
  Upon an ampler dunghill trod,
  Crow'd lustier late and early,
  Sipt wine from silver, praising God,
  And raked in golden barley.

  A private life was all his joy,
  Till in a court he saw
  A something-pottle-bodied boy,
  That knuckled at the taw:
  He stoop'd and clutch'd him, fair and good,
  Flew over roof and casement:
  His brothers of the weather stood
  Stock-still for sheer amazement.

  But he, by farmstead, thorpe and spire,
  And follow'd with acclaims,
  A sign to many a staring shire,
  Came crowing over Thames.
  Right down by smoky Paul's they bore,
  Till, where the street grows straiter, [5]
  One fix'd for ever at the door,
  And one became head-waiter.

  But whither would my fancy go?
  How out of place she makes
  The violet of a legend blow
  Among the chops and steaks!
  'Tis but a steward of the can,
  One shade more plump than common;
  As just and mere a serving-man
  As any born of woman.

  I ranged too high: what draws me down
  Into the common day?
  Is it the weight of that half-crown,
  Which I shall have to pay?

  For, something duller than at first,
  Nor wholly comfortable,
  I sit (my empty glass reversed),
  And thrumming on the table:

  Half-fearful that, with self at strife
  I take myself to task;
  Lest of the fullness of my life
  I leave an empty flask:
  For I had hope, by something rare,
  To prove myself a poet;
  But, while I plan and plan, my hair
  Is gray before I know it.

  So fares it since the years began,
  Till they be gather'd up;
  The truth, that flies the flowing can,
  Will haunt the vacant cup:
  And others' follies teach us not,
  Nor much their wisdom teaches;
  And most, of sterling worth, is what
  Our own experience preaches.

  Ah, let the rusty theme alone!
  We know not what we know.
  But for my pleasant hour, 'tis gone,
  'Tis gone, and let it go.
  'Tis gone: a thousand such have slipt
  Away from my embraces,
  And fall'n into the dusty crypt
  Of darken'd forms and faces.

  Go, therefore, thou! thy betters went
  Long since, and came no more;
  With peals of genial clamour sent
  From many a tavern-door,
  With twisted quirks and happy hits,
  From misty men of letters;
  The tavern-hours of mighty wits--
  Thine elders and thy betters.

  Hours, when the Poet's words and looks
  Had yet their native glow:
  Not yet the fear of little books
  Had made him talk for show:
  But, all his vast heart sherris-warm'd,
  He flash'd his random speeches;
  Ere days, that deal in ana, swarm'd
  His literary leeches.

  So mix for ever with the past,
  Like all good things on earth!
  For should I prize thee, couldst thou last,
  At half thy real worth?
  I hold it good, good things should pass:
  With time I will not quarrel:
  It is but yonder empty glass
  That makes me maudlin-moral.

  Head-waiter of the chop-house here,
  To which I most resort,
  I too must part: I hold thee dear
  For this good pint of port.
  For this, thou shalt from all things suck
  Marrow of mirth and laughter;
  And, wheresoe'er thou move, good luck
  Shall fling her old shoe after.

  But thou wilt never move from hence,
  The sphere thy fate allots:
  Thy latter days increased with pence
  Go down among the pots:
  Thou battenest by the greasy gleam
  In haunts of hungry sinners,
  Old boxes, larded with the steam
  Of thirty thousand dinners.

  _We_ fret, _we_ fume, would shift our skins,
  Would quarrel with our lot;
  _Thy_ care is, under polish'd tins,
  To serve the hot-and-hot;
  To come and go, and come again,
  Returning like the pewit,
  And watch'd by silent gentlemen,
  That trifle with the cruet.

  Live long, ere from thy topmost head
  The thick-set hazel dies;
  Long, ere the hateful crow shall tread
  The corners of thine eyes:
  Live long, nor feel in head or chest
  Our changeful equinoxes,
  Till mellow Death, like some late guest,
  Shall call thee from the boxes.

  But when he calls, and thou shalt cease
  To pace the gritted floor,
  And, laying down an unctuous lease
  Of life, shalt earn no more;
  No carved cross-bones, the types of Death,
  Shall show thee past to Heaven:
  But carved cross-pipes, and, underneath,
  A pint-pot neatly graven.

TO----

AFTER READING A LIFE AND LETTERS

Originally published in the 'Examiner' for 24th March, 1849; then in the
sixth edition of the poems, 1850, with the second part of the title and
the alterations noted. When reprinted in 1851 one more slight alteration
was made. It has not been altered since. The work referred to was
Moncton Milne's (afterwards Lord Houghton) 'Letters and Literary Remains
of Keats' published in 1848, and the person to whom the poem may have
been addressed was Tennyson's brother Charles, afterwards Charles
Tennyson Turner, to the facts of whose life and to whose character it
would exactly apply. See Napier,'Homes and Haunts of Tennyson', 48-50.
But Sir Franklin Lushington tells me that it was most probably addressed
to some imaginary person, as neither he nor such of Tennyson's surviving
friends as he kindly consulted for me are able to identify the person.


  You might have won the Poet's name
  If such be worth the winning now,
  And gain'd a laurel for your brow
  Of sounder leaf than I can claim;
  But you have made the wiser choice,
  A life that moves to gracious ends
  Thro' troops of unrecording friends,
  A deedful life, a silent voice:

  And you have miss'd the irreverent doom
  Of those that wear the Poet's crown:
  Hereafter, neither knave nor clown
  Shall hold their orgies at your tomb.

  For now the Poet cannot die
  Nor leave his music as of old,
  But round him ere he scarce be cold
  Begins the scandal and the cry:

  "Proclaim the faults he would not show:
  Break lock and seal: betray the trust:
  Keep nothing sacred: 'tis but just
  The many-headed beast should know".

  Ah, shameless! for he did but sing.
  A song that pleased us from its worth;
  No public life was his on earth,
  No blazon'd statesman he, nor king.

  He gave the people of his best:
  His worst he kept, his best he gave.
  My Shakespeare's curse on [1] clown and knave
  Who will not let his ashes rest!

  Who make it seem more sweet [2] to be
  The little life of bank and brier,
  The bird that pipes his lone desire
  And dies unheard within his tree,

  Than he that warbles long and loud
  And drops at Glory's temple-gates,
  For whom the carrion vulture waits
  To tear his heart before the crowd!


[Footnote 1: In Examiner and in 1850. My curse upon the.]

[Footnote 2: In Examiner. Sweeter seem. For the sentiment 'cf'. Goethe:--

  Ich singe, wie der Vogel singt
  Der in den Zweigen wohnet;
  Das Lied das aus dem Seele dringt
  Ist Lohn, der reichlich lohnet.

--'Der Sanger'.]








TO E. L.,

ON HIS TRAVELS IN GREECE

This was first printed in 1853. It has not been altered since. The poem
was addressed to Edward Lear, the landscape painter, and refers to his
travels.


  Illyrian woodlands, echoing falls
  Of water, sheets of summer glass,
  The long divine Peneian pass, [1]
  The vast Akrokeraunian walls, [2]

  Tomohrit, [3] Athos, all things fair,
  With such a pencil, such a pen,
  You shadow forth to distant men,
  I read and felt that I was there:

  And trust me, while I turn'd the page,
  And track'd you still on classic ground,
  I grew in gladness till I found
  My spirits in the golden age.

  For me the torrent ever pour'd
  And glisten'd--here and there alone
  The broad-limb'd Gods at random thrown
  By fountain-urns;-and Naiads oar'd

  A glimmering shoulder under gloom
  Of cavern pillars; on the swell
  The silver lily heaved and fell;
  And many a slope was rich in bloom

  From him that on the mountain lea
  By dancing rivulets fed his flocks,
  To him who sat upon the rocks,
  And fluted to the morning sea.


[Footnote 1:  'Cf'. Lear's description of Tempe:

  "It is not a vale, it is a narrow pass, and although extremely
  beautiful on account of the precipitous rocks on each side, the Peneus
  flowing deep in the midst between the richest overhanging plane woods,
  still its character is distinctly that of a ravine."

--'Journal', 409.]


[Footnote 2: The Akrokeraunian walls: the promontory now called Glossa.]

[Footnote 3: Tomohr, Tomorit, or Tomohritt is a lofty mountain in
Albania not far from Elbassan. Lear's account of it is very graphic:

  "That calm blue plain with Tomohr in the midst like an azure island in
  a boundless sea haunts my mind's eye and varies the present with the
  past".]








LADY CLARE

First published 1842. After 1851 no alterations were made.

This poem was suggested by Miss Ferrier's powerful novel 'The
Inheritance'. A comparison with the plot of Miss Ferrier's novel will
show with what tact and skill Tennyson has adapted the tale to his
ballad. Thomas St. Clair, youngest son of the Earl of Rossville, marries
a Miss Sarah Black, a girl of humble and obscure birth. He dies, leaving
a widow and as is supposed a daughter, Gertrude, who claim the
protection of Lord Rossville, as the child is heiress presumptive to the
earldom. On Lord Rossville's death she accordingly becomes Countess of
Rossville. She has two lovers, both distant connections, Colonel Delmour
and Edward Lyndsay. At last it is discovered that she was not the
daughter of Thomas St. Clair and her supposed mother, but of one Marion
La Motte and Jacob Leviston, and that Mrs. St. Clair had adopted her
when a baby and passed her off as her own child, that she might succeed
to the title. Meanwhile Delmour by the death of his elder brother
succeeds to the title and estates forfeited by the detected foundling,
but instead of acting as Tennyson's Lord Ronald does, he repudiates her
and marries a duchess. But her other lover Lyndsay is true to her and
marries her. Delmour not long afterwards dies without issue, and Lyndsay
succeeds to the title, Gertrude then becoming after all Countess of
Rossville. In details Tennyson follows the novel sometimes very closely.
Thus the "single rose," the poor dress, the bitter exclamation about her
being a beggar born, are from the novel.

The 1842 and all editions up to and including 1850 begin with the
following stanza and omit stanza 2:--



  Lord Ronald courted Lady Clare,
  I trow they did not part in scorn;
  Lord Ronald, her cousin, courted her
  And they will wed the morrow morn.


  It was the time when lilies blow,
  And clouds are highest up in air,
  Lord Ronald brought a lily-white doe
  To give his cousin Lady Clare.

  I trow they did not part in scorn:
  Lovers long-betroth'd were they:
  They two will wed the morrow morn!
  God's blessing on the day!

  "He does not love me for my birth,
  Nor for my lands so broad and fair;
  He loves me for my own true worth,
  And that is well," said Lady Clare.

  In there came old Alice the nurse,
  Said, "Who was this that went from thee?"
  "It was my cousin," said Lady Clare,
  "To-morrow he weds with me."

  "O God be thank'd!" said Alice the nurse,
  "That all comes round so just and fair:
  Lord Ronald is heir of all your lands,
  And you are not the Lady Clare."

  "Are ye out of your mind, my nurse, my nurse?"
  Said Lady Clare, "that ye speak so wild";
  "As God's above," said Alice the nurse,
  "I speak the truth: you are my child.

  "The old Earl's daughter died at my breast;
  I speak the truth, as I live by bread!
  I buried her like my own sweet child,
  And put my child in her stead."

  "Falsely, falsely have ye done,
  O mother," she said, "if this be true,
  To keep the best man under the sun
  So many years from his due."

  "Nay now, my child," said Alice the nurse,
  "But keep the secret for your life,
  And all you have will be Lord Ronald's,
  When you are man and wife."

  "If I'm a beggar born," she said,
  "I will speak out, for I dare not lie.
  Pull off, pull off, the broach [1] of gold,
  And fling the diamond necklace by."

  "Nay now, my child," said Alice the nurse,
  "But keep the secret all ye can."
  She said, "Not so: but I will know
  If there be any faith in man".

  "Nay now, what faith?" said Alice the nurse,
  "The man will cleave unto his right."
  "And he shall have it," the lady replied,
  "Tho' [2] I should die to-night."

  "Yet give one kiss to your mother dear!
  Alas, my child, I sinn'd for thee."
  "O mother, mother, mother," she said,
  "So strange it seems to me.

  "Yet here's a kiss for my mother dear,
  My mother dear, if this be so,
  And lay your hand upon my head,
  And bless me, mother, ere I go."

  She clad herself in a russet gown,
  She was no longer Lady Clare:
  She went by dale, and she went by down,
  With a single rose in her hair.

  The lily-white doe Lord Ronald had brought
  Leapt up from where she lay,
  Dropt her head in the maiden's hand,
  And follow'd her all the way. [3]

  Down stept Lord Ronald from his tower:
  "O Lady Clare, you shame your worth!
  Why come you drest like a village maid,
  That are the flower of the earth?"

  "If I come drest like a village maid,
  I am but as my fortunes are:
  I am a beggar born," she said, [4]
  "And not the Lady Clare."

  "Play me no tricks," said Lord Ronald,
  "For I am yours in word and in deed.
  Play me no tricks," said Lord Ronald,
  "Your riddle is hard to read."

  O and proudly stood she up!
  Her heart within her did not fail:
  She look'd into Lord Ronald's eyes,
  And told him all her nurse's tale.

  He laugh'd a laugh of merry scorn:
  He turn'd, and kiss'd her where she stood:
  "If you are not the heiress born,
  And I," said he, "the next in blood--

  "If you are not the heiress born,
  And I," said he, "the lawful heir,
  We two will wed to-morrow morn,
  And you shall still be Lady Clare."


[Footnote 1: All up to and including 1850. Brooch.]

[Footnote 2: All up to and including 1850. Though.]

[Footnote 3: The stanza beginning "The lily-white doe" is omitted in
1842 and 1843, and in the subsequent editions up to and including 1850
begins "A lily-white doe".]

[Footnote 4: In a letter addressed to Tennyson the late Mr. Peter Bayne
ventured to object to the dramatic propriety of Lady Clare speaking of
herself as "a beggar born". Tennyson defended it by saying: "You make no
allowance for the shock of the fall from being Lady Clare to finding
herself the child of a nurse". But the expression is Miss Ferrier's: "Oh
that she had suffered me to remain the beggar I was born"; and again to
her lover: "You have loved an impostor and a beggar".]











THE LORD OF BURLEIGH

Written, as we learn from 'Life', i., 182, by 1835. First published in
1842. No alteration since with the exception of "tho'" for "though".

This poem tells the well-known story of Sarah Hoggins who married under
the circumstances related in the poem. She died in January, 1797,
sinking, so it was said, but without any authority for such a statement,
under the burden of an honour "unto which she was not born". The story
is that Henry Cecil, heir presumptive to his uncle, the ninth Earl of
Exeter, was staying at Bolas, a rural village in Shropshire, where he
met Sarah Hoggins and married her. They lived together at Bolas, where
the two eldest of his children were born, for two years before he came
into the title. She bore him two other children after she was Countess
of Exeter, dying at Burleigh House near Stamford at the early age of
twenty-four. The obituary notice runs thus: "January, 1797. At Burleigh
House near Stamford, aged twenty-four, to the inexpressible surprise and
concern of all acquainted with her, the Right Honbl. Countess of
Exeter." For full information about this romantic incident see Walford's
'Tales of Great Families', first series, vol. i., 65-82, and two
interesting papers signed W. O. Woodall in 'Notes and Queries', seventh
series, vol. xii., 221-23; 'ibid.', 281-84, and Napier's 'Homes and
Haunts of Tennyson', 104-111.


  In her ear he whispers gaily,
  "If my heart by signs can tell,
  Maiden, I have watch'd thee daily,
  And I think thou lov'st me well".
  She replies, in accents fainter,
  "There is none I love like thee".
  He is but a landscape-painter,
  And a village maiden she.
  He to lips, that fondly falter,
  Presses his without reproof:
  Leads her to the village altar,
  And they leave her father's roof.
  "I can make no marriage present;
  Little can I give my wife.
  Love will make our cottage pleasant,
  And I love thee more than life."
  They by parks and lodges going
  See the lordly castles stand:
  Summer woods, about them blowing,
  Made a murmur in the land.
  From deep thought himself he rouses,
  Says to her that loves him well,
  "Let us see these handsome houses
  Where the wealthy nobles dwell".
  So she goes by him attended,
  Hears him lovingly converse,
  Sees whatever fair and splendid
  Lay betwixt his home and hers;
  Parks with oak and chestnut shady,
  Parks and order'd gardens great,
  Ancient homes of lord and lady,
  Built for pleasure and for state.
  All he shows her makes him dearer:
  Evermore she seems to gaze
  On that cottage growing nearer,
  Where they twain will spend their days.
  O but she will love him truly!
  He shall have a cheerful home;
  She will order all things duly,
  When beneath his roof they come.
  Thus her heart rejoices greatly,
  Till a gateway she discerns
  With armorial bearings stately,
  And beneath the gate she turns;
  Sees a mansion more majestic
  Than all those she saw before:
  Many a gallant gay domestic
  Bows before him at the door.
  And they speak in gentle murmur,
  When they answer to his call,
  While he treads with footstep firmer,
  Leading on from hall to hall.
  And, while now she wonders blindly,
  Nor the meaning can divine,
  Proudly turns he round and kindly,
  "All of this is mine and thine".
  Here he lives in state and bounty,
  Lord of Burleigh, fair and free,
  Not a lord in all the county
  Is so great a lord as he.
  All at once the colour flushes
  Her sweet face from brow to chin:
  As it were with shame she blushes,
  And her spirit changed within.
  Then her countenance all over
  Pale again as death did prove:
  But he clasp'd her like a lover,
  And he cheer'd her soul with love.
  So she strove against her weakness,
  Tho' at times her spirits sank:
  Shaped her heart with woman's meekness
  To all duties of her rank:
  And a gentle consort made he,
  And her gentle mind was such
  That she grew a noble lady,
  And the people loved her much.
  But a trouble weigh'd upon her,
  And perplex'd her, night and morn,
  With the burthen of an honour
  Unto which she was not born.
  Faint she grew, and ever fainter,
  As she murmur'd "Oh, that he
  Were once more that landscape-painter
  Which did win my heart from me!"
  So she droop'd and droop'd before him,
  Fading slowly from his side:
  Three fair children first she bore him,
  Then before her time she died.
  Weeping, weeping late and early,
  Walking up and pacing down,
  Deeply mourn'd the Lord of Burleigh,
  Burleigh-house by Stamford-town.
  And he came to look upon her,
  And he look'd at her and said,
  "Bring the dress and put it on her,
  That she wore when she was wed".
  Then her people, softly treading,
  Bore to earth her body, drest
  In the dress that she was wed in,
  That her spirit might have rest.







SIR LAUNCELOT AND QUEEN GUINEVERE

A FRAGMENT

First published in 1842. Not altered since 1853.

See for what may have given the hint for this fragment _Morte D'Arthur_,
bk. xix., ch. i., and bk. xx., ch. i., and _cf. Coming of Arthur:_--

    And Launcelot pass'd away among the flowers,
    For then was latter April, and return'd
    Among the flowers in May with Guinevere.



  Like souls that balance joy and pain,
  With tears and smiles from heaven again
  The maiden Spring upon the plain
  Came in a sun-lit fall of rain.
  In crystal vapour everywhere
  Blue isles of heaven laugh'd between,
  And, far in forest-deeps unseen,
  The topmost elm-tree [1] gather'd green
  From draughts of balmy air.

  Sometimes the linnet piped his song:
  Sometimes the throstle whistled strong:
  Sometimes the sparhawk, wheel'd along,
  Hush'd all the groves from fear of wrong:
  By grassy capes with fuller sound
  In curves the yellowing river ran,
  And drooping chestnut-buds began
  To spread into the perfect fan,
  Above the teeming ground.

  Then, in the boyhood of the year,
  Sir Launcelot and Queen Guinevere
  Rode thro' the coverts of the deer,
  With blissful treble ringing clear.
  She seem'd a part of joyous Spring:
  A gown of grass-green silk she wore,
  Buckled with golden clasps before;
  A light-green tuft of plumes she bore
  Closed in a golden ring.

  Now on some twisted ivy-net,
  Now by some tinkling rivulet,
  In mosses mixt [2] with violet
  Her cream-white mule his pastern set:
  And fleeter now [3] she skimm'd the plains
  Than she whose elfin prancer springs
  By night to eery warblings,
  When all the glimmering moorland rings
  With jingling bridle-reins.

  As she fled fast thro' sun and shade,
  The happy winds upon her play'd,
  Blowing the ringlet from the braid:
  She look'd so lovely, as she sway'd
  The rein with dainty finger-tips,
  A man had given all other bliss,
  And all his worldly worth for this,
  To waste his whole heart in one kiss
  Upon her perfect lips.


[Footnote 1: Up to 1848. Linden.]

[Footnote 2: All editions up to and including 1850. On mosses thick.]

[Footnote 3: 1842 to 1851. And now more fleet,]








A FAREWELL

First published in 1842. Not altered since 1843.

This poem was dedicated to the brook at Somersby described in the 'Ode
to Memory' and referred to so often in 'In Memoriam'. Possibly it may
have been written in 1837 when the Tennysons left Somersby. 'Cf. In
Memoriam', sect. ci.

  Flow down, cold rivulet, to the sea,
  Thy tribute wave deliver:
  No more by thee my steps shall be,
  For ever and for ever.

  Flow, softly flow, by lawn and lea,
  A rivulet then a river:
  No where by thee my steps shall be,
  For ever and for ever.

  But here will sigh thine alder tree,
  And here thine aspen shiver;
  And here by thee will hum the bee,
  For ever and for ever.

  A thousand suns [1] will stream on thee,
  A thousand moons will quiver;
  But not by thee my steps shall be,
  For ever and for ever.


[Footnote 1: 1842. A hundred suns.]








THE BEGGAR MAID

First published in 1842, not altered since.

Suggested probably by the fine ballad in Percy's _Reliques_, first
series, book ii., ballad vi.


  Her arms across her breast she laid;
  She was more fair than words can say:
  Bare-footed came the beggar maid
  Before the king Cophetua.
  In robe and crown the king stept down,
  To meet and greet her on her way;
  "It is no wonder," said the lords,
  "She is more beautiful than day".

  As shines the moon in clouded skies,
  She in her poor attire was seen:
  One praised her ancles, one her eyes,
  One her dark hair and lovesome mien:
  So sweet a face, such angel grace,
  In all that land had never been:
  Cophetua sware a royal oath:
  "This beggar maid shall be my queen!"







THE VISION OF SIN

First published in 1842. No alteration made in it after 1851, except in
the insertion of a couplet afterwards omitted.

This remarkable poem may be regarded as a sort of companion poem to 'The
Palace of Art'; the one traces the effect of callous indulgence in mere
intellectual and aesthetic pleasures, the other of profligate indulgence
in the grosser forms of sensual enjoyment. At first all is ecstasy and
intoxication, then comes satiety, and all that satiety brings in its
train, cynicism, pessimism, the drying up of the very springs of life.
"The body chilled, jaded and ruined, the cup of pleasure drained to the
dregs, the senses exhausted of their power to enjoy, the spirit of its
wish to aspire, nothing left but loathing, craving and rottenness." See
Spedding in 'Edinburgh Review' for April, 1843. The poem concludes by
leaving as an answer to the awful question, "can there be final
salvation for the poor wretch?" a reply undecipherable by man, and dawn
breaking in angry splendour. The best commentary on the poem would be
Byron's lyric: "There's not a joy the world can give like that it takes
away," and 'Don Juan'; biography and daily life are indeed full of
comments on the truth of this fine allegory.


  1

  I had a vision when the night was late:
  A youth came riding toward a palace-gate.
  He rode a horse with wings, that would have flown, [1]
  But that his heavy rider kept him down.
  And from the palace came a child of sin,
  And took him by the curls, and led him in,
  Where sat a company with heated eyes,
  Expecting when a fountain should arise:
  A sleepy light upon their brows and lips--
  As when the sun, a crescent of eclipse,
  Dreams over lake and lawn, and isles and capes--
  Suffused them, sitting, lying, languid shapes,
  By heaps of gourds, and skins of wine, and piles of grapes.


  2

  Then methought I heard a mellow sound,
  Gathering up from all the lower ground; [2]
  Narrowing in to where they sat assembled
  Low voluptuous music winding trembled,
  Wov'n in circles: they that heard it sigh'd,
  Panted hand in hand with faces pale,
  Swung themselves, and in low tones replied;
  Till the fountain spouted, showering wide
  Sleet of diamond-drift and pearly hail;
  Then the music touch'd the gates and died;
  Rose again from where it seem'd to fail,
  Storm'd in orbs of song, a growing gale;
  Till thronging in and in, to where they waited,
  As 'twere a hundred-throated nightingale,
  The strong tempestuous treble throbb'd and palpitated;
  Ran into its giddiest whirl of sound,
  Caught the sparkles, and in circles,
  Purple gauzes, golden hazes, liquid mazes,
  Flung the torrent rainbow round:
  Then they started from their places,
  Moved with violence, changed in hue,
  Caught each other with wild grimaces,
  Half-invisible to the view,
  Wheeling with precipitate paces
  To the melody, till they flew,
  Hair, and eyes, and limbs, and faces,
  Twisted hard in fierce embraces,
  Like to Furies, like to Graces,
  Dash'd together in blinding dew:
  Till, kill'd with some luxurious agony,
  The nerve-dissolving melody
  Flutter'd headlong from the sky.


  3

  And then I look'd up toward a mountain-tract,
  That girt the region with high cliff and lawn:
  I saw that every morning, far withdrawn
  Beyond the darkness and the cataract,
  God made himself an awful rose of dawn, [3]
  Unheeded: and detaching, fold by fold,
  From those still heights, and, slowly drawing near,
  A vapour heavy, hueless, formless, cold,
  Came floating on for many a month and year,
  Unheeded: and I thought I would have spoken,
  And warn'd that madman ere it grew too late:
  But, as in dreams, I could not. Mine was broken,
  When that cold vapour touch'd the palace-gate,
  And link'd again. I saw within my head
  A gray and gap-tooth'd man as lean as death,
  Who slowly rode across a wither'd heath,
  And lighted at a ruin'd inn, and said:


  4

  "Wrinkled ostler, grim and thin!
  Here is custom come your way;
  Take my brute, and lead him in,
  Stuff his ribs with mouldy hay.

  "Bitter barmaid, waning fast!
  See that sheets are on my bed;
  What! the flower of life is past:
  It is long before you wed.

  "Slip-shod waiter, lank and sour,
  At the Dragon on the heath!
  Let us have a quiet hour,
  Let us hob-and-nob with Death.

  "I am old, but let me drink;
  Bring me spices, bring me wine;
  I remember, when I think,
  That my youth was half divine.

  "Wine is good for shrivell'd lips,
  When a blanket wraps the day,
  When the rotten woodland drips,
  And the leaf is stamp'd in clay.

  "Sit thee down, and have no shame,
  Cheek by jowl, and knee by knee:
  What care I for any name?
  What for order or degree?

  "Let me screw thee up a peg:
  Let me loose thy tongue with wine:
  Callest thou that thing a leg?
  Which is thinnest? thine or mine?

  "Thou shalt not be saved by works:
  Thou hast been a sinner too:
  Ruin'd trunks on wither'd forks,
  Empty scarecrows, I and you!

  "Fill the cup, and fill the can:
  Have a rouse before the morn:
  Every moment dies a man,
  Every moment one is born. [4]

  "We are men of ruin'd blood;
  Therefore comes it we are wise.
  Fish are we that love the mud.
  Rising to no fancy-flies.

  "Name and fame! to fly sublime
  Thro' the courts, the camps, the schools,
  Is to be the ball of Time,
  Bandied by the hands of fools.

  "Friendship!--to be two in one--
  Let the canting liar pack!
  Well I know, when I am gone,
  How she mouths behind my back.

  "Virtue!--to be good and just--
  Every heart, when sifted well,
  Is a clot of warmer dust,
  Mix'd with cunning sparks of hell.

  "O! we two as well can look
  Whited thought and cleanly life
  As the priest, above his book
  Leering at his neighbour's wife.

  "Fill the cup, and fill the can:
  Have a rouse before the morn:
  Every moment dies a man,
  Every moment one is born. [4]

  "Drink, and let the parties rave:
  They are fill'd with idle spleen;
  Rising, falling, like a wave,
  For they know not what they mean.

  "He that roars for liberty
  Faster binds a tyrant's [5] power;
  And the tyrant's cruel glee
  Forces on the freer hour.

  "Fill the can, and fill the cup:
  All the windy ways of men
  Are but dust that rises up,
  And is lightly laid again.

  "Greet her with applausive breath,
  Freedom, gaily doth she tread;
  In her right a civic wreath,
  In her left a human head.

  "No, I love not what is new;
  She is of an ancient house:
  And I think we know the hue
  Of that cap upon her brows.

  "Let her go! her thirst she slakes
  Where the bloody conduit runs:
  Then her sweetest meal she makes
  On the first-born of her sons.

  "Drink to lofty hopes that cool--
  Visions of a perfect State:
  Drink we, last, the public fool,
  Frantic love and frantic hate.

  "Chant me now some wicked stave,
  Till thy drooping courage rise,
  And the glow-worm of the grave
  Glimmer in thy rheumy eyes.

  "Fear not thou to loose thy tongue;
  Set thy hoary fancies free;
  What is loathsome to the young
  Savours well to thee and me.

  "Change, reverting to the years,
  When thy nerves could understand
  What there is in loving tears,
  And the warmth of hand in hand.

  "Tell me tales of thy first love--
  April hopes, the fools of chance;
  Till the graves begin to move,
  And the dead begin to dance.

  "Fill the can, and fill the cup:
  All the windy ways of men
  Are but dust that rises up,
  And is lightly laid again.

  "Trooping from their mouldy dens
  The chap-fallen circle spreads:
  Welcome, fellow-citizens,
  Hollow hearts and empty heads!

  "You are bones, and what of that?
  Every face, however full,
  Padded round with flesh and fat,
  Is but modell'd on a skull.

  "Death is king, and Vivat Rex!
  Tread a measure on the stones,
  Madam--if I know your sex,
  From the fashion of your bones.

  "No, I cannot praise the fire
  In your eye--nor yet your lip:
  All the more do I admire
  Joints of cunning workmanship.

  "Lo! God's likeness--the ground-plan--
  Neither modell'd, glazed, or framed:
  Buss me thou rough sketch of man,
  Far too naked to be shamed!

  "Drink to Fortune, drink to Chance,
  While we keep a little breath!
  Drink to heavy Ignorance!
  Hob-and-nob with brother Death!

  "Thou art mazed, the night is long,
  And the longer night is near:
  What! I am not all as wrong
  As a bitter jest is dear.

  "Youthful hopes, by scores, to all,
  When the locks are crisp and curl'd;
  Unto me my maudlin gall
  And my mockeries of the world.

  "Fill the cup, and fill the can!
  Mingle madness, mingle scorn!
  Dregs of life, and lees of man:
  Yet we will not die forlorn."

  The voice grew faint: there came a further change:
  Once more uprose the mystic mountain-range:
  Below were men and horses pierced with worms,
  And slowly quickening into lower forms;
  By shards and scurf of salt, and scum of dross,
  Old plash of rains, and refuse patch'd with moss,
  Then some one spake [6]: "Behold! it was a crime
  Of sense avenged by sense that wore with time".
  [7] Another said: "The crime of sense became
  The crime of malice, and is equal blame".
  And one: "He had not wholly quench'd his power;
  A little grain of conscience made him sour".
  At last I heard a voice upon the slope
  Cry to the summit, "Is there any hope?"
  To which an answer peal'd from that high land.
  But in a tongue no man could understand;
  And on the glimmering limit far withdrawn
  God made Himself an awful rose of dawn. [8]


[Footnote 1: A reference to the famous passage in the 'Phoedrus' where
Plato compares the soul to a chariot drawn by the two-winged steeds.]

Footnote 2: Imitated apparently from the dance in Shelley's 'Triumph of
Life':--

  The wild dance maddens in the van; and those
  ...
  Mix with each other in tempestuous measure
  To savage music, wilder as it grows.

  They, tortur'd by their agonising pleasure,
  Convuls'd, and on the rapid whirlwinds spun
  ...
  Maidens and youths fling their wild arms in air.
  As their feet twinkle, etc.]


[Footnote 3: See footnote to last line.]

[Footnote 4: All up to and including 1850 read:--

  Every _minute_ dies a man,
  Every _minute_ one is born.

Mr. Babbage, the famous mathematician, is said to have addressed the
following letter to Tennyson in reference to this couplet:--

  "I need hardly point out to you that this calculation would tend to
  keep the sum total of the world's population in a state of perpetual
  equipoise, whereas it is a]**[Footnote: well-known fact that the said
  sum total is constantly on the increase. I would therefore take the
  liberty of suggesting that, in the next edition of your excellent
  poem, the erroneous calculation to which I refer should be corrected
  as follows:--

    Every moment dies a man,
    And one and a sixteenth is born.

  I may add that the exact figures are 1.167, but something must, of
  course, be conceded to the laws of metre."]


[Footnote 5: 1842 and 1843. The tyrant's.]

[Footnote 6: 1842. Said.]

[Footnote 7: In the Selection published in 1865 Tennyson here inserted a
couplet which he afterwards omitted:--

  Another answer'd: "But a crime of sense!"
  "Give him new nerves with old experience."]


[Footnote 8: In Professor Tyndall's reminiscences of Tennyson, inserted
in Tennyson's 'Life', he says he once asked him for some
explanation of this line, and the poet's reply was:

  "The power of explaining such concentrated expressions of the
  imagination was very different from that of writing them".

And on another occasion he said very happily:

  "Poetry is like shot silk with many glancing colours. Every reader
  must find his own interpretation, according to his ability, and
  according to his sympathy with the poet".

Poetry in its essential forms always suggests infinitely more than it
expresses, and at once inspires and kindles the intelligence which is to
comprehend it; if that intelligence, which is perhaps only another name
for sympathy, does not exist, then, in Byron's happy sarcasm:--

  "The gentle readers wax unkind,
  And, not so studious for the poet's ease,
  Insist on knowing what he 'means', a hard
  And hapless situation for a bard".

Possibly Tennyson may have had in his mind Keats's line:--

"There was an awful rainbow once in heaven"]







COME NOT, WHEN I AM DEAD...

First published in 'The Keepsake' for 1851.

  Come not, when I am dead,
  To drop thy foolish tears upon my grave,
  To trample round my fallen head,
  And vex the unhappy dust thou wouldst not save.
  There let the wind sweep and the plover cry;
  But thou, go by. [1]

  Child, if it were thine error or thy crime
  I care no longer, being all unblest:
  Wed whom thou wilt, but I am sick of Time, [2]
  And I desire to rest.
  Pass on, weak heart, and leave me where I lie:
  Go by, go by.


[Footnote 1: 'The Keepsake':--But go thou by.]

[Footnote 2: 'The Keepsake' has a small 't' for Time.]








THE EAGLE

{FRAGMENT}

First published in 1851. It has not been altered.


  He clasps the crag with hooked hands;
  Close to the sun in lonely lands,
  Ring'd with the azure world, he stands.

  The wrinkled sea beneath him crawls; [1]
  He watches from his mountain walls,
  And like a thunderbolt he falls.


[Footnote 1: One of Tennyson's most magically descriptive lines; nothing
could exceed the vividness of the words "wrinkled" and "crawls" here.]








MOVE EASTWARD, HAPPY EARTH...

First published in 1842.

  Move eastward, happy earth, and leave
  Yon orange sunset waning slow:
  From fringes of the faded eve,
  O, happy planet, eastward go;
  Till over thy dark shoulder glow
  Thy silver sister-world, and rise
  To glass herself in dewy eyes
  That watch me from the glen below.

  Ah, bear me with thee, smoothly [1] borne,
  Dip forward under starry light,
  And move me to my marriage-morn,
  And round again to happy night.


[Footnote 1: 1842 to 1853. Lightly.]







BREAK, BREAK, BREAK...

First published in 1842. No alteration.

This exquisite poem was composed in a very different scene from that to
which it refers, namely in "a Lincolnshire lane at five o'clock in the
morning between blossoming hedges". See 'Life of Tennyson', vol. i., p.
223.

  Break, break, break,
  On thy cold gray stones, O Sea!
  And I would that my tongue could utter
  The thoughts that arise in me.

  O well for the fisherman's boy,
  That he shouts with his sister at play!
  O well for the sailor lad,
  That he sings in his boat on the bay!

  And the stately ships go on
  To their haven under the hill;
  But O for the touch of a vanish'd hand,
  And the sound of a voice that is still!

  Break, break, break,
  At the foot of thy crags, O Sea!
  But the tender grace of a day that is dead
  Will never come back to me.






THE POET'S SONG

First published in 1842.

  The rain had fallen, the Poet arose,
  He pass'd by the town and out of the street,
  A light wind blew from the gates of the sun,
  And waves of shadow went over the wheat,
  And he sat him down in a lonely place,
  And chanted a melody loud and sweet,
  That made the wild-swan pause in her cloud,
  And the lark drop down at his feet.

  The swallow stopt as he hunted the bee, [1]
  The snake slipt under a spray,
  The wild hawk stood with the down on his beak,
  And stared, with his foot on the prey,
  And the nightingale thought, "I have sung many songs,
  But never a one so gay,
  For he sings of what the world will be
  When the years have died away".


[Footnote 1: 1889, Fly.]

POEMS PUBLISHED IN MDCCCXXX


ELEGIACS

Reprinted in Collected Works among 'Juvenilia', with title
altered to 'Leonine Elegiacs'. The only alterations made in the
text were "wood-dove" for "turtle," and the substitution of "or" for
"and" in the last line but one.

  Lowflowing breezes are roaming the broad valley dimm'd in the
    gloaming:
  Thoro' the black-stemm'd pines only the far river shines.
  Creeping thro' blossomy rushes and bowers of rose-blowing bushes,
  Down by the poplar tall rivulets babble and fall.
  Barketh the shepherd-dog cheerily; the grasshopper carolleth clearly;
  Deeply the turtle coos; shrilly the owlet halloos;
  Winds creep; dews fell chilly: in her first sleep earth breathes
    stilly:
  Over the pools in the burn watergnats murmur and mourn.
  Sadly the far kine loweth: the glimmering water outfloweth:
  Twin peaks shadow'd with pine slope to the dark hyaline.
  Lowthroned Hesper is stayed between the two peaks; but the Naiad
  Throbbing in mild unrest holds him beneath in her breast.

  The ancient poetess singeth, that Hesperus all things bringeth,
  Smoothing the wearied mind: bring me my love, Rosalind.
  Thou comest morning and even; she cometh not morning or even.
  False-eyed Hesper, unkind, where is my sweet Rosalind?




THE "HOW" AND THE "WHY"


  I am any man's suitor,
  If any will be my tutor:
  Some say this life is pleasant,
  Some think it speedeth fast:
  In time there is no present,
  In eternity no future,
  In eternity no past.
  We laugh, we cry, we are born, we die,
  Who will riddle me the _how_ and the _why_?

  The bulrush nods unto its brother,
  The wheatears whisper to each other:
  What is it they say? What do they there?
  Why two and two make four? Why round is not square?
  Why the rocks stand still, and the light clouds fly?
  Why the heavy oak groans, and the white willows sigh?
  Why deep is not high, and high is not deep?
  Whether we wake, or whether we sleep?
  Whether we sleep, or whether we die?
  How you are you? Why I am I?
  Who will riddle me the _how_ and the _why_?

  The world is somewhat; it goes on somehow;
  But what is the meaning of _then_ and _now_?
  I feel there is something; but how and what?
  I know there is somewhat; but what and why?
  I cannot tell if that somewhat be I.

  The little bird pipeth, "why? why?"
  In the summerwoods when the sun falls low
  And the great bird sits on the opposite bough,
  And stares in his face and shouts, "how? how?"
  And the black owl scuds down the mellow twilight,
  And chaunts, "how? how?" the whole of the night.

  Why the life goes when the blood is spilt?
  What the life is? where the soul may lie?
  Why a church is with a steeple built;
  And a house with a chimneypot?
  Who will riddle me the how and the what?
  Who will riddle me the what and the why?







SUPPOSED CONFESSIONS

OF A SECOND-RATE SENSITIVE MIND NOT IN UNITY WITH ITSELF

There has been only one important alteration made in this poem, when it
was reprinted among the 'Juvenilia' in 1871, and that was the
suppression of the verses beginning "A grief not uninformed and dull" to
"Indued with immortality" inclusive, and the substitution of "rosy" for
"waxen". Capitals are in all cases inserted in the reprint where the
Deity is referred to, "through" is altered into "thro'" all through the
poem, and hyphens are inserted in the double epithets. No further
alterations were made in the edition of 1830.

  Oh God! my God! have mercy now.
  I faint, I fall. Men say that thou
  Didst die for me, for such as _me_,
  Patient of ill, and death, and scorn,
  And that my sin was as a thorn
  Among the thorns that girt thy brow,
  Wounding thy soul.--That even now,
  In this extremest misery
  Of ignorance, I should require
  A sign! and if a bolt of fire
  Would rive the slumbrous summernoon
  While I do pray to thee alone,
  Think my belief would stronger grow!
  Is not my human pride brought low?
  The boastings of my spirit still?
  The joy I had in my freewill
  All cold, and dead, and corpse-like grown?
  And what is left to me, but thou,
  And faith in thee? Men pass me by;
  Christians with happy countenances--
  And children all seem full of thee!
  And women smile with saint-like glances
  Like thine own mother's when she bow'd
  Above thee, on that happy morn
  When angels spake to men aloud,
  And thou and peace to earth were born.
  Goodwill to me as well as all--
  I one of them: my brothers they:
  Brothers in Christ--a world of peace
  And confidence, day after day;
  And trust and hope till things should cease,
  And then one Heaven receive us all.
  How sweet to have a common faith!
  To hold a common scorn of death!
  And at a burial to hear
  The creaking cords which wound and eat
  Into my human heart, whene'er
  Earth goes to earth, with grief, not fear,
  With hopeful grief, were passing sweet!

  A grief not uninformed, and dull
  Hearted with hope, of hope as full
  As is the blood with life, or night
  And a dark cloud with rich moonlight.
  To stand beside a grave, and see
  The red small atoms wherewith we
  Are built, and smile in calm, and say--
  "These little moles and graves shall be
  Clothed on with immortality
  More glorious than the noon of day--
  All that is pass'd into the flowers
  And into beasts and other men,
  And all the Norland whirlwind showers
  From open vaults, and all the sea
  O'er washes with sharp salts, again
  Shall fleet together all, and be
  Indued with immortality."

  Thrice happy state again to be
  The trustful infant on the knee!
  Who lets his waxen fingers play
  About his mother's neck, and knows
  Nothing beyond his mother's eyes.
  They comfort him by night and day;
  They light his little life alway;
  He hath no thought of coming woes;
  He hath no care of life or death,
  Scarce outward signs of joy arise,
  Because the Spirit of happiness
  And perfect rest so inward is;
  And loveth so his innocent heart,
  Her temple and her place of birth,
  Where she would ever wish to dwell,
  Life of the fountain there, beneath
  Its salient springs, and far apart,
  Hating to wander out on earth,
  Or breathe into the hollow air,
  Whose dullness would make visible
  Her subtil, warm, and golden breath,
  Which mixing with the infant's blood,
  Fullfills him with beatitude.
  Oh! sure it is a special care
  Of God, to fortify from doubt,
  To arm in proof, and guard about
  With triple-mailed trust, and clear
  Delight, the infant's dawning year.

  Would that my gloomed fancy were
  As thine, my mother, when with brows
  Propped on thy knees, my hands upheld
  In thine, I listen'd to thy vows,
  For me outpour'd in holiest prayer--
  For me unworthy!--and beheld
  Thy mild deep eyes upraised, that knew
  The beauty and repose of faith,
  And the clear spirit shining through.
  Oh! wherefore do we grow awry
  From roots which strike so deep? why dare
  Paths in the desert? Could not I
  Bow myself down, where thou hast knelt,
  To th' earth--until the ice would melt
  Here, and I feel as thou hast felt?
  What Devil had the heart to scathe
  Flowers thou hadst rear'd--to brush the dew
  From thine own lily, when thy grave
  Was deep, my mother, in the clay?
  Myself? Is it thus? Myself? Had I
  So little love for thee? But why
  Prevail'd not thy pure prayers? Why pray
  To one who heeds not, who can save
  But will not? Great in faith, and strong
  Against the grief of circumstance
  Wert thou, and yet unheard. What if
  Thou pleadest still, and seest me drive
  Thro' utter dark a fullsailed skiff,
  Unpiloted i' the echoing dance
  Of reboant whirlwinds, stooping low
  Unto the death, not sunk! I know
  At matins and at evensong,
  That thou, if thou were yet alive,
  In deep and daily prayers wouldst strive
  To reconcile me with thy God.
  Albeit, my hope is gray, and cold
  At heart, thou wouldest murmur still--
  "Bring this lamb back into thy fold,
  My Lord, if so it be thy will".
  Wouldst tell me I must brook the rod,
  And chastisement of human pride;
  That pride, the sin of devils, stood
  Betwixt me and the light of God!
  That hitherto I had defied
  And had rejected God--that grace
  Would drop from his o'erbrimming love,
  As manna on my wilderness,
  If I would pray--that God would move
  And strike the hard hard rock, and thence,
  Sweet in their utmost bitterness,
  Would issue tears of penitence
  Which would keep green hope's life. Alas!
  I think that pride hath now no place
  Nor sojourn in me. I am void,
  Dark, formless, utterly destroyed.

  Why not believe then? Why not yet
  Anchor thy frailty there, where man
  Hath moor'd and rested? Ask the sea
  At midnight, when the crisp slope waves
  After a tempest, rib and fret
  The broadimbased beach, why he
  Slumbers not like a mountain tarn?
  Wherefore his ridges are not curls
  And ripples of an inland mere?
  Wherefore he moaneth thus, nor can
  Draw down into his vexed pools
  All that blue heaven which hues and paves
  The other? I am too forlorn,
  Too shaken: my own weakness fools
  My judgment, and my spirit whirls,
  Moved from beneath with doubt and fear.

  "Yet" said I, in my morn of youth,
  The unsunned freshness of my strength,
  When I went forth in quest of truth,
  "It is man's privilege to doubt,
  If so be that from doubt at length,
  Truth may stand forth unmoved of change,
  An image with profulgent brows,
  And perfect limbs, as from the storm
  Of running fires and fluid range
  Of lawless airs, at last stood out
  This excellence and solid form
  Of constant beauty. For the Ox
  Feeds in the herb, and sleeps, or fills
  The horned valleys all about,
  And hollows of the fringed hills
  In summerheats, with placid lows
  Unfearing, till his own blood flows
  About his hoof. And in the flocks
  The lamb rejoiceth in the year,
  And raceth freely with his fere,
  And answers to his mother's calls
  From the flower'd furrow. In a time,
  Of which he wots not, run short pains
  Through his warm heart; and then, from whence
  He knows not, on his light there falls
  A shadow; and his native slope,
  Where he was wont to leap and climb,
  Floats from his sick and filmed eyes,
  And something in the darkness draws
  His forehead earthward, and he dies.
  Shall man live thus, in joy and hope
  As a young lamb, who cannot dream,
  Living, but that he shall live on?
  Shall we not look into the laws
  Of life and death, and things that seem,
  And things that be, and analyse
  Our double nature, and compare
  All creeds till we have found the one,
  If one there be?" Ay me! I fear
  All may not doubt, but everywhere
  Some must clasp Idols. Yet, my God,
  Whom call I Idol? Let thy dove
  Shadow me over, and my sins
  Be unremembered, and thy love
  Enlighten me. Oh teach me yet
  Somewhat before the heavy clod
  Weighs on me, and the busy fret
  Of that sharpheaded worm begins
  In the gross blackness underneath.

  O weary life! O weary death!
  O spirit and heart made desolate!
  O damned vacillating state!







THE BURIAL OF LOVE

  His eyes in eclipse,
  Pale cold his lips,
  The light of his hopes unfed,
  Mute his tongue,
  His bow unstrung
  With the tears he hath shed,
  Backward drooping his graceful head,

  Love is dead;
  His last arrow is sped;
  He hath not another dart;
  Go--carry him to his dark deathbed;
  Bury him in the cold, cold heart--
  Love is dead.

  Oh, truest love! art thou forlorn,
  And unrevenged? thy pleasant wiles
  Forgotten, and thine innocent joy?
  Shall hollowhearted apathy,
  The cruellest form of perfect scorn,
  With languor of most hateful smiles,
  For ever write
  In the withered light
  Of the tearless eye,
  An epitaph that all may spy?
  No! sooner she herself shall die.

  For her the showers shall not fall,
  Nor the round sun that shineth to all;
  Her light shall into darkness change;
  For her the green grass shall not spring,
  Nor the rivers flow, nor the sweet birds sing,
  Till Love have his full revenge.






TO--

  Sainted Juliet! dearest name!
  If to love be life alone,
  Divinest Juliet,
  I love thee, and live; and yet
  Love unreturned is like the fragrant flame
  Folding the slaughter of the sacrifice
  Offered to gods upon an altarthrone;
  My heart is lighted at thine eyes,
  Changed into fire, and blown about with sighs.






SONG


  I

  I' the glooming light
  Of middle night
  So cold and white,
  Worn Sorrow sits by the moaning wave;
  Beside her are laid
  Her mattock and spade,
  For she hath half delved her own deep grave.
  Alone she is there:
  The white clouds drizzle: her hair falls loose;
  Her shoulders are bare;
  Her tears are mixed with the bearded dews.


  II

  Death standeth by;
  She will not die;
  With glazed eye
  She looks at her grave: she cannot sleep;
  Ever alone
  She maketh her moan:
  She cannot speak; she can only weep;
  For she will not hope.
  The thick snow falls on her flake by flake,
  The dull wave mourns down the slope,
  The world will not change, and her heart will not break.






SONG

  The lintwhite and the throstlecock
  Have voices sweet and clear;
  All in the bloomed May.
  They from the blosmy brere
  Call to the fleeting year,
  If that he would them hear
  And stay. Alas! that one so beautiful
  Should have so dull an ear.


  II

  Fair year, fair year, thy children call,
  But thou art deaf as death;
  All in the bloomed May.
  When thy light perisheth
  That from thee issueth,
  Our life evanisheth: Oh! stay.
  Alas! that lips so cruel-dumb
  Should have so sweet a breath!


  III

  Fair year, with brows of royal love
  Thou comest, as a king,
  All in the bloomed May.
  Thy golden largess fling,
  And longer hear us sing;
  Though thou art fleet of wing,
  Yet stay. Alas! that eyes so full of light
  Should be so wandering!


  IV

  Thy locks are all of sunny sheen
  In rings of gold yronne, [1]
  All in the bloomed May,
  We pri'thee pass not on;
  If thou dost leave the sun,
  Delight is with thee gone, Oh! stay.
  Thou art the fairest of thy feres,
  We pri'thee pass not on.


[Footnote 1: His crispe hair in ringis was yronne.--Chaucer, _Knight's
Tale._ (Tennyson's note.)]








SONG


  I

  Every day hath its night:
  Every night its morn:
  Thorough dark and bright
  Winged hours are borne;
  Ah! welaway!

  Seasons flower and fade;
  Golden calm and storm
  Mingle day by day.
  There is no bright form
  Doth not cast a shade--
  Ah! welaway!


  II

  When we laugh, and our mirth
  Apes the happy vein,
  We're so kin to earth,
  Pleasaunce fathers pain--
  Ah! welaway!
  Madness laugheth loud:
  Laughter bringeth tears:
  Eyes are worn away
  Till the end of fears
  Cometh in the shroud,
  Ah! welaway!


  III

  All is change, woe or weal;
  Joy is Sorrow's brother;
  Grief and gladness steal
  Symbols of each other;
  Ah! welaway!
  Larks in heaven's cope
  Sing: the culvers mourn
  All the livelong day.
  Be not all forlorn;
  Let us weep, in hope--
  Ah! welaway!







NOTHING WILL DIE

Reprinted without any important alteration among the 'Juvenilia' in
1871 and onward. No change made except that "through" is spelt "thro',"
and in the last line "and" is substituted for "all".


  When will the stream be aweary of flowing
  Under my eye?
  When will the wind be aweary of blowing
  Over the sky?
  When will the clouds be aweary of fleeting?
  When will the heart be aweary of beating?
  And nature die?
  Never, oh! never, nothing will die?
  The stream flows,
  The wind blows,
  The cloud fleets,
  The heart beats,
  Nothing will die.

  Nothing will die;
  All things will change
  Through eternity.
  'Tis the world's winter;
  Autumn and summer
  Are gone long ago;
  Earth is dry to the centre,
  But spring, a new comer,
  A spring rich and strange,
  Shall make the winds blow
  Round and round,
  Through and through,
  Here and there,
  Till the air
  And the ground
  Shall be filled with life anew.

  The world was never made;
  It will change, but it will not fade.
  So let the wind range;
  For even and morn
  Ever will be
  Through eternity.
  Nothing was born;
  Nothing will die;
  All things will change.







ALL THINGS WILL DIE

Reprinted among 'Juvenilia' in 1872 and onward, without alteration.


  Clearly the blue river chimes in its flowing
  Under my eye;
  Warmly and broadly the south winds are blowing
  Over the sky.
  One after another the white clouds are fleeting;
  Every heart this May morning in joyance is beating
  Full merrily;
  Yet all things must die.
  The stream will cease to flow;
  The wind will cease to blow;
  The clouds will cease to fleet;
  The heart will cease to beat;
  For all things must die.

  All things must die.
  Spring will come never more.
  Oh! vanity!
  Death waits at the door.
  See! our friends are all forsaking
  The wine and the merrymaking.
  We are called--we must go.
  Laid low, very low,
  In the dark we must lie.
  The merry glees are still;
  The voice of the bird
  Shall no more be heard,
  Nor the wind on the hill.
  Oh! misery!
  Hark! death is calling
  While I speak to ye,
  The jaw is falling,
  The red cheek paling,
  The strong limbs failing;
  Ice with the warm blood mixing;
  The eyeballs fixing.
  Nine times goes the passing bell:
  Ye merry souls, farewell.
  The old earth
  Had a birth,
  As all men know,
  Long ago.
  And the old earth must die.
  So let the warm winds range,
  And the blue wave beat the shore;
  For even and morn
  Ye will never see
  Through eternity.
  All things were born.
  Ye will come never more,
  For all things must die.







HERO TO LEANDER

  Oh go not yet, my love,
  The night is dark and vast;
  The white moon is hid in her heaven above,
  And the waves climb high and fast.
  Oh! kiss me, kiss me, once again,
  Lest thy kiss should be the last.
  Oh kiss me ere we part;
  Grow closer to my heart.
  My heart is warmer surely than the bosom of the main.

  Oh joy! 0 bliss of blisses!
  My heart of hearts art thou.
  Come bathe me with thy kisses,
  My eyelids and my brow.
  Hark how the wild rain hisses,
  And the loud sea roars below.

  Thy heart beats through thy rosy limbs
  So gladly doth it stir;
  Thine eye in drops of gladness swims.
  I have bathed thee with the pleasant myrrh;
  Thy locks are dripping balm;
  Thou shalt not wander hence to-night,
  I'll stay thee with my kisses.
  To-night the roaring brine
  Will rend thy golden tresses;
  The ocean with the morrow light
  Will be both blue and calm;
  And the billow will embrace thee with a kiss as soft as mine.

  No western odours wander
  On the black and moaning sea,
  And when thou art dead, Leander,
  My soul must follow thee!
  Oh go not yet, my love
  Thy voice is sweet and low;
  The deep salt wave breaks in above
  Those marble steps below.
  The turretstairs are wet
  That lead into the sea.
  Leander! go not yet.
  The pleasant stars have set:
  Oh! go not, go not yet,
  Or I will follow thee.





THE MYSTIC

  Angels have talked with him, and showed him thrones:
  Ye knew him not: he was not one of ye,
  Ye scorned him with an undiscerning scorn;
  Ye could not read the marvel in his eye,
  The still serene abstraction; he hath felt
  The vanities of after and before;
  Albeit, his spirit and his secret heart
  The stern experiences of converse lives,
  The linked woes of many a fiery change
  Had purified, and chastened, and made free.
  Always there stood before him, night and day,
  Of wayward vary colored circumstance,
  The imperishable presences serene
  Colossal, without form, or sense, or sound,
  Dim shadows but unwaning presences
  Fourfaced to four corners of the sky;
  And yet again, three shadows, fronting one,
  One forward, one respectant, three but one;
  And yet again, again and evermore,
  For the two first were not, but only seemed,
  One shadow in the midst of a great light,
  One reflex from eternity on time,
  One mighty countenance of perfect calm,
  Awful with most invariable eyes.
  For him the silent congregated hours,
  Daughters of time, divinely tall, beneath
  Severe and youthful brows, with shining eyes
  Smiling a godlike smile (the innocent light
  Of earliest youth pierced through and through with all
  Keen knowledges of low-embowed eld)
  Upheld, and ever hold aloft the cloud
  Which droops low hung on either gate of life,
  Both birth and death; he in the centre fixt,
  Saw far on each side through the grated gates
  Most pale and clear and lovely distances.
  He often lying broad awake, and yet
  Remaining from the body, and apart
  In intellect and power and will, hath heard
  Time flowing in the middle of the night,
  And all things creeping to a day of doom.
  How could ye know him? Ye were yet within
  The narrower circle; he had wellnigh reached
  The last, with which a region of white flame,
  Pure without heat, into a larger air
  Upburning, and an ether of black blue,
  Investeth and ingirds all other lives.






THE GRASSHOPPER


  I

  Voice of the summerwind,
  Joy of the summerplain,
  Life of the summerhours,
  Carol clearly, bound along.
  No Tithon thou as poets feign
  (Shame fall 'em they are deaf and blind)
  But an insect lithe and strong,
  Bowing the seeded summerflowers.
  Prove their falsehood and thy quarrel,
  Vaulting on thine airy feet.
  Clap thy shielded sides and carol,
  Carol clearly, chirrup sweet.
  Thou art a mailed warrior in youth and strength complete;
  Armed cap-a-pie,
  Full fair to see;
  Unknowing fear,
  Undreading loss,
  A gallant cavalier
  'Sans peur et sans reproche,'
  In sunlight and in shadow,
  The Bayard of the meadow.


  II

  I would dwell with thee,
  Merry grasshopper,
  Thou art so glad and free,
  And as light as air;
  Thou hast no sorrow or tears,
  Thou hast no compt of years,
  No withered immortality,
  But a short youth sunny and free.
  Carol clearly, bound along,
  Soon thy joy is over,
  A summer of loud song,
  And slumbers in the clover.
  What hast thou to do with evil
  In thine hour of love and revel,
  In thy heat of summerpride,
  Pushing the thick roots aside
  Of the singing flowered grasses,
  That brush thee with their silken tresses?
  What hast thou to do with evil,
  Shooting, singing, ever springing
  In and out the emerald glooms,
  Ever leaping, ever singing,
  Lighting on the golden blooms?






LOVE, PRIDE AND FORGETFULNESS

  Ere yet my heart was sweet Love's tomb,
  Love laboured honey busily.
  I was the hive and Love the bee,
  My heart the honey-comb.
  One very dark and chilly night
  Pride came beneath and held a light.

  The cruel vapours went through all,
  Sweet Love was withered in his cell;
  Pride took Love's sweets, and by a spell,
  Did change them into gall;
  And Memory tho' fed by Pride
  Did wax so thin on gall,
  Awhile she scarcely lived at all,
  What marvel that she died?







CHORUS

In an unpublished drama written very early.

  The varied earth, the moving heaven,
  The rapid waste of roving sea,
  The fountainpregnant mountains riven
  To shapes of wildest anarchy,
  By secret fire and midnight storms
  That wander round their windy cones,
  The subtle life, the countless forms
  Of living things, the wondrous tones
  Of man and beast are full of strange
  Astonishment and boundless change.

  The day, the diamonded light,
  The echo, feeble child of sound,
  The heavy thunder's griding might,
  The herald lightning's starry bound,
  The vocal spring of bursting bloom,
  The naked summer's glowing birth,
  The troublous autumn's sallow gloom,
  The hoarhead winter paving earth
  With sheeny white, are full of strange
  Astonishment and boundless change.

  Each sun which from the centre flings
  Grand music and redundant fire,
  The burning belts, the mighty rings,
  The murmurous planets' rolling choir,
  The globefilled arch that, cleaving air,
  Lost in its effulgence sleeps,
  The lawless comets as they glare,
  And thunder thro' the sapphire deeps
  In wayward strength, are full of strange
  Astonishment and boundless change.






LOST HOPE

  You cast to ground the hope which once was mine,
  But did the while your harsh decree deplore,
  Embalming with sweet tears the vacant shrine,
  My heart, where Hope had been and was no more.

  So on an oaken sprout
  A goodly acorn grew;
  But winds from heaven shook the acorn out,
  And filled the cup with dew.





THE TEARS OF HEAVEN

  Heaven weeps above the earth all night till morn,
  In darkness weeps, as all ashamed to weep,
  Because the earth hath made her state forlorn
  With selfwrought evils of unnumbered years,
  And doth the fruit of her dishonour reap.
  And all the day heaven gathers back her tears
  Into her own blue eyes so clear and deep,
  And showering down the glory of lightsome day,
  Smiles on the earth's worn brow to win her if she may.






LOVE AND SORROW

  O Maiden, fresher than the first green leaf
  With which the fearful springtide flecks the lea,
  Weep not, Almeida, that I said to thee
  That thou hast half my heart, for bitter grief
  Doth hold the other half in sovranty.
  Thou art my heart's sun in love's crystalline:
  Yet on both sides at once thou canst not shine:
  Thine is the bright side of my heart, and thine
  My heart's day, but the shadow of my heart,
  Issue of its own substance, my heart's night
  Thou canst not lighten even with 'thy' light,
  All powerful in beauty as thou art.
  Almeida, it my heart were substanceless,
  Then might thy rays pass thro' to the other side,
  So swiftly, that they nowhere would abide,
  But lose themselves in utter emptiness.
  Half-light, half-shadow, let my spirit sleep;
  They never learnt to love who never knew to weep.







TO A LADY SLEEPING

  O Thou whose fringed lids I gaze upon,
  Through whose dim brain the winged dreams are borne,
  Unroof the shrines of clearest vision,
  In honour of the silverflecked morn:
  Long hath the white wave of the virgin light
  Driven back the billow of the dreamful dark.
  Thou all unwittingly prolongest night,
  Though long ago listening the poised lark,
  With eyes dropt downward through the blue serene,
  Over heaven's parapets the angels lean.







SONNET

  Could I outwear my present state of woe
  With one brief winter, and indue i' the spring
  Hues of fresh youth, and mightily outgrow
  The wan dark coil of faded suffering--
  Forth in the pride of beauty issuing
  A sheeny snake, the light of vernal bowers,
  Moving his crest to all sweet plots of flowers
  And watered vallies where the young birds sing;
  Could I thus hope my lost delights renewing,
  I straightly would commend the tears to creep
  From my charged lids; but inwardly I weep:
  Some vital heat as yet my heart is wooing:
  This to itself hath drawn the frozen rain
  From my cold eyes and melted it again.







SONNET

  Though Night hath climbed her peak of highest noon,
  And bitter blasts the screaming autumn whirl,
  All night through archways of the bridged pearl
  And portals of pure silver walks the moon.
  Wake on, my soul, nor crouch to agony,
  Turn cloud to light, and bitterness to joy,
  And dross to gold with glorious alchemy,
  Basing thy throne above the world's annoy.
  Reign thou above the storms of sorrow and ruth
  That roar beneath; unshaken peace hath won thee:
  So shalt thou pierce the woven glooms of truth;
  So shall the blessing of the meek be on thee;
  So in thine hour of dawn, the body's youth,
  An honourable old shall come upon thee.






SONNET

  Shall the hag Evil die with child of Good,
  Or propagate again her loathed kind,
  Thronging the cells of the diseased mind,
  Hateful with hanging cheeks, a withered brood,
  Though hourly pastured on the salient blood?
  Oh! that the wind which bloweth cold or heat
  Would shatter and o'erbear the brazen beat
  Of their broad vans, and in the solitude
  Of middle space confound them, and blow back
  Their wild cries down their cavernthroats, and slake
  With points of blastborne hail their heated eyne!
  So their wan limbs no more might come between
  The moon and the moon's reflex in the night;
  Nor blot with floating shades the solar light.







SONNET

  The pallid thunderstricken sigh for gain,
  Down an ideal stream they ever float,
  And sailing on Pactolus in a boat,
  Drown soul and sense, while wistfully they strain
  Weak eyes upon the glistering sands that robe
  The understream. The wise could he behold
  Cathedralled caverns of thick-ribbed gold
  And branching silvers of the central globe,
  Would marvel from so beautiful a sight
  How scorn and ruin, pain and hate could flow:
  But Hatred in a gold cave sits below,
  Pleached with her hair, in mail of argent light
  Shot into gold, a snake her forehead clips
  And skins the colour from her trembling lips.







LOVE


  I

  Thou, from the first, unborn, undying love,
  Albeit we gaze not on thy glories near,
  Before the face of God didst breathe and move,
  Though night and pain and ruin and death reign here.
  Thou foldest, like a golden atmosphere,
  The very throne of the eternal God:
  Passing through thee the edicts of his fear
  Are mellowed into music, borne abroad
  By the loud winds, though they uprend the sea,
  Even from his central deeps: thine empery
  Is over all: thou wilt not brook eclipse;
  Thou goest and returnest to His Lips
  Like lightning: thou dost ever brood above
  The silence of all hearts, unutterable Love.


  II

  To know thee is all wisdom, and old age
  Is but to know thee: dimly we behold thee
  Athwart the veils of evil which enfold thee.
  We beat upon our aching hearts with rage;
  We cry for thee: we deem the world thy tomb.
  As dwellers in lone planets look upon
  The mighty disk of their majestic sun,
  Hollowed in awful chasms of wheeling gloom,
  Making their day dim, so we gaze on thee.
  Come, thou of many crowns, white-robed love,
  Oh! rend the veil in twain: all men adore thee;
  Heaven crieth after thee; earth waileth for thee:
  Breathe on thy winged throne, and it shall move
  In music and in light o'er land and sea.


  III

  And now--methinks I gaze upon thee now,
  As on a serpent in his agonies
  Awestricken Indians; what time laid low
  And crushing the thick fragrant reeds he lies,
  When the new year warm breathed on the earth,
  Waiting to light him with his purple skies,
  Calls to him by the fountain to uprise.
  Already with the pangs of a new birth
  Strain the hot spheres of his convulsed eyes,
  And in his writhings awful hues begin
  To wander down his sable sheeny sides,
  Like light on troubled waters: from within
  Anon he rusheth forth with merry din,
  And in him light and joy and strength abides;
  And from his brows a crown of living light
  Looks through the thickstemmed woods by day and night.





THE KRAKEN

Reprinted without alteration, except in the spelling of "antient," among
'Juvenilia' in 1871 and onward.

  Below the thunders of the upper deep;
  Far, far beneath in the abysmal sea,
  His antient, dreamless, uninvaded sleep
  The Kraken sleepeth: faintest sunlights flee
  About his shadowy sides: above him swell
  Huge sponges of millennial growth and height;
  And far away into the sickly light,
  From many a wondrous grot and secret cell
  Unnumber'd and enormous polypi
  Winnow with giant arms the slumbering green.
  There hath he lain for ages and will lie
  Battening upon huge seaworms in his sleep,
  Until the latter fire shall heat the deep;
  Then once by man and angels to be seen,
  In roaring he shall rise and on the surface die.






ENGLISH WAR SONG

  Who fears to die? Who fears to die?
  Is there any here who fears to die
  He shall find what he fears, and none shall grieve
  For the man who fears to die;
  But the withering scorn of the many shall cleave
  To the man who fears to die.

  Chorus.--
           Shout for England!
           Ho! for England!
           George for England!
           Merry England!
           England for aye!

  The hollow at heart shall crouch forlorn,
  He shall eat the bread of common scorn;
  It shall be steeped in the salt, salt tear,
  Shall be steeped in his own salt tear:
  Far better, far better he never were born
  Than to shame merry England here.

  Chorus.--Shout for England! etc.

  There standeth our ancient enemy;
  Hark! he shouteth--the ancient enemy!
  On the ridge of the hill his banners rise;
  They stream like fire in the skies;
  Hold up the Lion of England on high
  Till it dazzle and blind his eyes.

  Chorus.--Shout for England! etc.

  Come along! we alone of the earth are free;
  The child in our cradles is bolder than he;
  For where is the heart and strength of slaves?
  Oh! where is the strength of slaves?
  He is weak! we are strong; he a slave, we are free;
  Come along! we will dig their graves.

  Chorus.--Shout for England! etc.

  There standeth our ancient enemy;
  Will he dare to battle with the free?
  Spur along! spur amain! charge to the fight:
  Charge! charge to the fight!
  Hold up the Lion of England on high!
  Shout for God and our right!

  Chorus.-Shout for England! etc.







NATIONAL SONG

  There is no land like England
  Where'er the light of day be;
  There are no hearts like English hearts,
  Such hearts of oak as they be.
  There is no land like England
  Where'er the light of day be;
  There are no men like Englishmen,
  So tall and bold as they be.

  Chorus. For the French the Pope may shrive 'em,
          For the devil a whit we heed 'em,
          As for the French, God speed 'em
          Unto their hearts' desire,
          And the merry devil drive 'em
          Through the water and the fire.

          Our glory is our freedom,
          We lord it o'er the sea;
          We are the sons of freedom,
          We are free.

  There is no land like England,
  Where'er the light of day be;
  There are no wives like English wives,
  So fair and chaste as they be.
  There is no land like England,
  Where'er the light of day be;
  There are no maids like English maids,
  So beautiful as they be.

  Chorus.--For the French, etc.






DUALISMS

  Two bees within a chrystal flowerbell rocked
  Hum a lovelay to the westwind at noontide.
  Both alike, they buzz together,
  Both alike, they hum together
  Through and through the flowered heather.

  Where in a creeping cove the wave unshocked
  Lays itself calm and wide,
  Over a stream two birds of glancing feather
  Do woo each other, carolling together.
  Both alike, they glide together
  Side by side;
  Both alike, they sing together,
  Arching blue-glossed necks beneath the purple weather.

  Two children lovelier than Love, adown the lea are singing,
  As they gambol, lilygarlands ever stringing:
  Both in blosmwhite silk are frocked:
  Like, unlike, they roam together
  Under a summervault of golden weather;
  Like, unlike, they sing together
  Side by side,
  Mid May's darling goldenlocked,
  Summer's tanling diamondeyed.






WE ARE FREE

Reprinted among 'Juvenilia' in 1871 and onward without alteration,
except that it is printed as two stanzas.

  The winds, as at their hour of birth,
  Leaning upon the ridged sea,
  Breathed low around the rolling earth
  With mellow preludes, "We are Free";
  The streams through many a lilied row,
  Down-carolling to the crisped sea,
  Low-tinkled with a bell-like flow
  Atween the blossoms, "We are free".



[Greek: Oi Rheontes]

  I

  All thoughts, all creeds, all dreams are true,
  All visions wild and strange;
  Man is the measure of all truth
  Unto himself. All truth is change:
  All men do walk in sleep, and all
  Have faith in that they dream:
  For all things are as they seem to all,
  And all things flow like a stream.


  II

  There is no rest, no calm, no pause,
  Nor good nor ill, nor light nor shade,
  Nor essence nor eternal laws:
  For nothing is, but all is made.
  But if I dream that all these are,
  They are to me for that I dream;
  For all things are as they seem to all,
  And all things flow like a stream.


Argal--This very opinion is only true relatively to the flowing
philosophers. (Tennyson's note.)







POEMS OF MDCCCXXXIII



"MINE BE THE STRENGTH OF SPIRIT..."

Reprinted without any alteration, except that Power is spelt with a
small p, among the _Juvenilia_ in 1871 and onward.


  Mine be the strength of spirit, full and free,
  Like some broad river rushing down alone,
  With the selfsame impulse wherewith he was thrown
  From his loud fount upon the echoing lea:--
  Which with increasing might doth forward flee
  By town, and tower, and hill, and cape, and isle,
  And in the middle of the green salt sea
  Keeps his blue waters fresh for many a mile.
  Mine be the Power which ever to its sway
  Will win the wise at once, and by degrees
  May into uncongenial spirits flow;
  Even as the great gulfstream of Florida
  Floats far away into the Northern Seas
  The lavish growths of Southern Mexico.







TO--

When this poem was republished among the _Juvenilia_ in 1871 several
alterations were made in it. For the first stanza was substituted the
following:--

  My life is full of weary days,
  But good things have not kept aloof,
  Nor wander'd into other ways:
  I have not lack'd thy mild reproof,
  Nor golden largess of thy praise.

The second began "And now shake hands". In the fourth stanza for "sudden
laughters" of the jay was substituted the felicitous "sudden scritches,"
and the sixth and seventh stanzas were suppressed.


  I

  All good things have not kept aloof
  Nor wandered into other ways:
  I have not lacked thy mild reproof,
  Nor golden largess of thy praise.
  But life is full of weary days.


  II

  Shake hands, my friend, across the brink
  Of that deep grave to which I go:
  Shake hands once more: I cannot sink
  So far--far down, but I shall know
  Thy voice, and answer from below.


  III

  When in the darkness over me
  The fourhanded mole shall scrape,
  Plant thou no dusky cypresstree,
  Nor wreathe thy cap with doleful crape,
  But pledge me in the flowing grape.


  IV

  And when the sappy field and wood
  Grow green beneath the showery gray,
  And rugged barks begin to bud,
  And through damp holts newflushed with May,
  Ring sudden laughters of the Jay,


  V

  Then let wise Nature work her will,
  And on my clay her darnels grow;
  Come only, when the days are still,
  And at my headstone whisper low,
  And tell me if the woodbines blow.

  VI

  If thou art blest, my mother's smile
  Undimmed, if bees are on the wing:
  Then cease, my friend, a little while,
  That I may hear the throstle sing
  His bridal song, the boast of spring.


  VII

  Sweet as the noise in parched plains
  Of bubbling wells that fret the stones,
  (If any sense in me remains)
  Thy words will be: thy cheerful tones
  As welcome to my crumbling bones.






BUONAPARTE

Reprinted without any alteration among 'Early Sonnets' in 1872, and
unaltered since.


  He thought to quell the stubborn hearts of oak,
  Madman!--to chain with chains, and bind with bands
  That island queen who sways the floods and lands
  From Ind to Ind, but in fair daylight woke,
  When from her wooden walls, lit by sure hands,
  With thunders and with lightnings and with smoke,
  Peal after peal, the British battle broke,
  Lulling the brine against the Coptic sands.
  We taught him lowlier moods, when Elsinore
  Heard the war moan along the distant sea,
  Rocking with shatter'd spars, with sudden fires
  Flamed over: at Trafalgar yet once more
  We taught him: late he learned humility
  Perforce, like those whom Gideon school'd with briers.







SONNET

I

  Oh, Beauty, passing beauty! sweetest Sweet!
  How canst thou let me waste my youth in sighs?
  I only ask to sit beside thy feet.
  Thou knowest I dare not look into thine eyes,
  Might I but kiss thy hand! I dare not fold
  My arms about thee--scarcely dare to speak.
  And nothing seems to me so wild and bold,
  As with one kiss to touch thy blessed cheek.
  Methinks if I should kiss thee, no control
  Within the thrilling brain could keep afloat
  The subtle spirit. Even while I spoke,
  The bare word KISS hath made my inner soul
  To tremble like a lutestring, ere the note
  Hath melted in the silence that it broke.


II

Reprinted in 1872 among 'Early Sonnets' with two alterations, "If I
were loved" for "But were I loved," and "tho'" for "though".

  But were I loved, as I desire to be,
  What is there in the great sphere of the earth,
  And range of evil between death and birth,
  That I should fear--if I were loved by thee?
  All the inner, all the outer world of pain
  Clear Love would pierce and cleave, if thou wert mine,
  As I have heard that, somewhere in the main,
  Fresh water-springs come up through bitter brine.
  'Twere joy, not fear, clasped hand in hand with thee,
  To wait for death--mute--careless of all ills,
  Apart upon a mountain, though the surge
  Of some new deluge from a thousand hills
  Flung leagues of roaring foam into the gorge
  Below us, as far on as eye could see.






THE HESPERIDES

    Hesperus and his daughters three
    That sing about the golden tree.

    (Comus).


  The Northwind fall'n, in the newstarred night
  Zidonian Hanno, voyaging beyond
  The hoary promontory of Soloe
  Past Thymiaterion, in calmed bays,
  Between the Southern and the Western Horn,
  Heard neither warbling of the nightingale,
  Nor melody o' the Lybian lotusflute
  Blown seaward from the shore; but from a slope
  That ran bloombright into the Atlantic blue,
  Beneath a highland leaning down a weight
  Of cliffs, and zoned below with cedarshade,
  Came voices, like the voices in a dream,
  Continuous, till he reached the other sea.






SONG


  I

  The golden apple, the golden apple, the hallowed fruit,
  Guard it well, guard it warily,
  Singing airily,
  Standing about the charmed root.
  Round about all is mute,
  As the snowfield on the mountain-peaks,
  As the sandfield at the mountain-foot.
  Crocodiles in briny creeks
  Sleep and stir not: all is mute.
  If ye sing not, if ye make false measure,
  We shall lose eternal pleasure,
  Worth eternal want of rest.
  Laugh not loudly: watch the treasure
  Of the wisdom of the West.
  In a corner wisdom whispers.
  Five and three
  (Let it not be preached abroad) make an awful mystery.
  For the blossom unto three-fold music bloweth;
  Evermore it is born anew;
  And the sap to three-fold music floweth,
  From the root
  Drawn in the dark,
  Up to the fruit,
  Creeping under the fragrant bark,
  Liquid gold, honeysweet thro' and thro'.
  Keen-eyed Sisters, singing airily,
  Looking warily
  Every way,
  Guard the apple night and day,
  Lest one from the East come and take it away.


  II

  Father Hesper, Father Hesper, watch, watch, ever and aye,
  Looking under silver hair with a silver eye.
  Father, twinkle not thy stedfast sight;
  Kingdoms lapse, and climates change, and races die;
  Honour comes with mystery;
  Hoarded wisdom brings delight.
  Number, tell them over and number
  How many the mystic fruittree holds,
  Lest the redcombed dragon slumber
  Rolled together in purple folds.
  Look to him, father, lest he wink, and the golden apple be stol'n away,
  For his ancient heart is drunk with over-watchings night and day,
  Round about the hallowed fruit tree curled--
  Sing away, sing aloud evermore in the wind, without stop,
  Lest his scaled eyelid drop, For he is older than the world.
  If he waken, we waken,
  Rapidly levelling eager eyes.
  If he sleep, we sleep,
  Dropping the eyelid over the eyes.
  If the golden apple be taken
  The world will be overwise.
  Five links, a golden chain, are we,
  Hesper, the dragon, and sisters three,
  Bound about the golden tree.


  III

  Father Hesper, Father Hesper, watch, watch, night and day,
  Lest the old wound of the world be healed,
  The glory unsealed,
  The golden apple stol'n away,
  And the ancient secret revealed.
  Look from west to east along:
  Father, old Himala weakens,
  Caucasus is bold and strong.
  Wandering waters unto wandering waters call;
  Let them clash together, foam and fall.
  Out of watchings, out of wiles,
  Comes the bliss of secret smiles.
  All things are not told to all,
  Half-round the mantling night is drawn,
  Purplefringed with even and dawn.
  Hesper hateth Phosphor, evening hateth morn.


  IV

  Every flower and every fruit the redolent breath
  Of this warm seawind ripeneth,
  Arching the billow in his sleep;
  But the landwind wandereth,
  Broken by the highland-steep,
  Two streams upon the violet deep:
  For the western sun and the western star,
  And the low west wind, breathing afar,
  The end of day and beginning of night
  Make the apple holy and bright,
  Holy and bright, round and full, bright and blest,
  Mellowed in a land of rest;
  Watch it warily day and night;
  All good things are in the west,
  Till midnoon the cool east light
  Is shut out by the round of the tall hillbrow;
  But when the fullfaced sunset yellowly
  Stays on the flowering arch of the bough,
  The luscious fruitage clustereth mellowly,
  Goldenkernelled, goldencored,
  Sunset-ripened, above on the tree,
  The world is wasted with fire and sword,
  But the apple of gold hangs over the sea,
  Five links, a golden chain, are we,
  Hesper, the dragon, and sisters three,
  Daughters three,
  Bound about
  All round about
  The gnarled bole of the charmed tree,
  The golden apple, the golden apple, the hallowed fruit,
  Guard it well, guard it warily,
  Watch it warily,
  Singing airily,
  Standing about the charmed root.






ROSALIND

Not reprinted till 1884 when it was unaltered, as it has remained since:
but the poem appended and printed by Tennyson (in the footnote) has not
been reprinted.

  My Rosalind, my Rosalind,
  My frolic falcon, with bright eyes,
  Whose free delight, from any height of rapid flight,
  Stoops at all game that wing the skies,
  My Rosalind, my Rosalind,
  My bright-eyed, wild-eyed falcon, whither,
  Careless both of wind and weather,
  Whither fly ye, what game spy ye,
  Up or down the streaming wind?


  II

  The quick lark's closest-carolled strains,
  The shadow rushing up the sea,
  The lightningflash atween the rain,
  The sunlight driving down the lea,
  The leaping stream, the very wind,
  That will not stay, upon his way,
  To stoop the cowslip to the plains,
  Is not so clear and bold and free
  As you, my falcon Rosalind.
  You care not for another's pains,
  Because you are the soul of joy,
  Bright metal all without alloy.
  Life shoots and glances thro' your veins,
  And flashes off a thousand ways,
  Through lips and eyes in subtle rays.
  Your hawkeyes are keen and bright,
  Keen with triumph, watching still
  To pierce me through with pointed light;
  And oftentimes they flash and glitter
  Like sunshine on a dancing rill,
  And your words are seeming-bitter,
  Sharp and few, but seeming-bitter
  From excess of swift delight.


  III

  Come down, come home, my Rosalind,
  My gay young hawk, my Rosalind:
  Too long you keep the upper skies;
  Too long you roam, and wheel at will;
  But we must hood your random eyes,
  That care not whom they kill,
  And your cheek, whose brilliant hue
  Is so sparkling fresh to view,
  Some red heath-flower in the dew,
  Touched with sunrise. We must bind
  And keep you fast, my Rosalind,
  Fast, fast, my wild-eyed Rosalind,
  And clip your wings, and make you love:
  When we have lured you from above,
  And that delight of frolic flight, by day or night,
  From North to South;
  We'll bind you fast in silken cords,
  And kiss away the bitter words
  From off your rosy mouth. [1]


[Footnote 1: Perhaps the following lines may be allowed to stand as a
separate poem; originally they made part of the text, where they were
manifestly superfluous:--

    My Rosalind, my Rosalind,
    Bold, subtle, careless Rosalind,
    Is one of those who know no strife
    Of inward woe or outward fear;
    To whom the slope and stream of life,
    The life before, the life behind,
    In the ear, from far and near,
    Chimeth musically clear.
    My falconhearted Rosalind,
    Fullsailed before a vigorous wind,
    Is one of those who cannot weep
    For others' woes, but overleap
    All the petty shocks and fears
    That trouble life in early years,
    With a flash of frolic scorn
    And keen delight, that never falls
    Away from freshness, self-upborne
    With such gladness, as, whenever
    The freshflushing springtime calls
    To the flooding waters cool,
    Young fishes, on an April morn,
    Up and down a rapid river,
    Leap the little waterfalls
    That sing into the pebbled pool.
    My happy falcon, Rosalind;
    Hath daring fancies of her own,
    Fresh as the dawn before the day,
    Fresh as the early seasmell blown
    Through vineyards from an inland bay.
    My Rosalind, my Rosalind,
    Because no shadow on you falls
    Think you hearts are tennis balls
    To play with, wanton Rosalind?]







SONG

  Who can say
  Why To-day
  To-morrow will be yesterday?
  Who can tell
  Why to smell
  The violet, recalls the dewy prime
  Of youth and buried time?
  The cause is nowhere found in rhyme.



KATE

Reprinted without alteration among the 'Juvenilia' in 1895.


  I know her by her angry air,
  Her brightblack eyes, her brightblack hair,
  Her rapid laughters wild and shrill,
  As laughter of the woodpecker
  From the bosom of a hill.
  'Tis Kate--she sayeth what she will;
  For Kate hath an unbridled tongue,
  Clear as the twanging of a harp.
  Her heart is like a throbbing star.
  Kate hath a spirit ever strung
  Like a new bow, and bright and sharp
  As edges of the scymetar.
  Whence shall she take a fitting mate?
  For Kate no common love will feel;
  My woman-soldier, gallant Kate,
  As pure and true as blades of steel.

  Kate saith "the world is void of might".
  Kate saith "the men are gilded flies".
  Kate snaps her fingers at my vows;
  Kate will not hear of lover's sighs.
  I would I were an armed knight,
  Far famed for wellwon enterprise,
  And wearing on my swarthy brows
  The garland of new-wreathed emprise:
  For in a moment I would pierce
  The blackest files of clanging fight,
  And strongly strike to left and right,
  In dreaming of my lady's eyes.
  Oh! Kate loves well the bold and fierce;
  But none are bold enough for Kate,
  She cannot find a fitting mate.







SONNET

Written, on hearing of the outbreak of the Polish Insurrection.


  Blow ye the trumpet, gather from afar
  The hosts to battle: be not bought and sold.
  Arise, brave Poles, the boldest of the bold;
  Break through your iron shackles--fling them far.
  O for those days of Piast, ere the Czar
  Grew to this strength among his deserts cold;
  When even to Moscow's cupolas were rolled
  The growing murmurs of the Polish war!
  Now must your noble anger blaze out more
  Than when from Sobieski, clan by clan,
  The Moslem myriads fell, and fled before--
  Than when Zamoysky smote the Tartar Khan,
  Than earlier, when on the Baltic shore
  Boleslas drove the Pomeranian.







POLAND

Reprinted without alteration in 1872, except the removal of italics in
"now" among the 'Early Sonnets'.


  How long, O God, shall men be ridden down,
  And trampled under by the last and least
  Of men? The heart of Poland hath not ceased
  To quiver, tho' her sacred blood doth drown
  The fields; and out of every smouldering town
  Cries to Thee, lest brute Power be increased,
  Till that o'ergrown Barbarian in the East
  Transgress his ample bound to some new crown:--
  Cries to thee, "Lord, how long shall these things be?
  How long this icyhearted Muscovite
  Oppress the region?" Us, O Just and Good,
  Forgive, who smiled when she was torn in three;
  Us, who stand now, when we should aid the right--
  A matter to be wept with tears of blood!



TO--

Reprinted without alteration as first of the 'Early Sonnets' in
1872; subsequently in the twelfth line "That tho'" was substituted for
"Altho'," and the last line was altered to--

  "And either lived in either's heart and speech,"

and "hath" was not italicised.


  As when with downcast eyes we muse and brood,
  And ebb into a former life, or seem
  To lapse far back in some confused dream
  To states of mystical similitude;
  If one but speaks or hems or stirs his chair,
  Ever the wonder waxeth more and more,
  So that we say, "All this hath been before,
  All this _hath_ been, I know not when or where".
  So, friend, when first I look'd upon your face,
  Our thought gave answer each to each, so true--
  Opposed mirrors each reflecting each--
  Altho' I knew not in what time or place,
  Methought that I had often met with you,
  And each had lived in the other's mind and speech.







O DARLING ROOM


  I

  O darling room, my heart's delight,
  Dear room, the apple of my sight,
  With thy two couches soft and white,
  There is no room so exquisite,
  No little room so warm and bright,
  Wherein to read, wherein to write.


  II

  For I the Nonnenwerth have seen,
  And Oberwinter's vineyards green,
  Musical Lurlei; and between
  The hills to Bingen have I been,
  Bingen in Darmstadt, where the Rhene
  Curves towards Mentz, a woody scene.


  III

  Yet never did there meet my sight,
  In any town, to left or right,
  A little room so exquisite,
  With two such couches soft and white;
  Not any room so warm and bright,
  Wherein to read, wherein to write.






TO CHRISTOPHER NORTH

  You did late review my lays,
  Crusty Christopher;
  You did mingle blame and praise,
  Rusty Christopher.
  When I learnt from whom it came,
  I forgave you all the blame,
  Musty Christopher;
  I could _not_ forgive the praise,
  Fusty Christopher.






THE SKIPPING ROPE

This silly poem was first published in the edition of 1842, and was
retained unaltered till 1851, when it was finally suppressed.


  Sure never yet was Antelope
  Could skip so lightly by,
  Stand off, or else my skipping-rope
  Will hit you in the eye.
  How lightly whirls the skipping-rope!
  How fairy-like you fly!
  Go, get you gone, you muse and mope--
  I hate that silly sigh.
  Nay, dearest, teach me how to hope,
  Or tell me how to die.
  There, take it, take my skipping-rope,
  And hang yourself thereby.





TIMBUCTOO

A POEM WHICH OBTAINED THE CHANCELLOR'S MEDAL AT THE 'Cambridge
Commencement' M.DCCCXXIX BY A. TENNYSON Of Trinity College.

Printed in the Cambridge 'Chronicle and Journal' for Friday, 10th July,
1839, and at the University Press by James Smith, among the 'Profusiones
Academicae Praemiis annuis dignatae, et in Curia Cantabrigiensi
Recitatae Comitiis Maximis' A.D. M.DCCCXXIX. Reprinted in an edition of
the 'Cambridge Prize Poems' from 1813 to 1858 inclusive, by Messrs.
Macmillan in 1859, but without any alteration, except in punctuation and
the substitution of small letters for capitals where the change was
appropriate; and again in 1893 in the appendix to the reprint of the
'Poems by Two Brothers'.

    Deep in that lion-haunted island lies
    A mystic city, goal of enterprise.

    (Chapman.)


  I stood upon the Mountain which o'erlooks
  The narrow seas, whose rapid interval
  Parts Afric from green Europe, when the Sun
  Had fall'n below th' Atlantick, and above
  The silent Heavens were blench'd with faery light,
  Uncertain whether faery light or cloud,
  Flowing Southward, and the chasms of deep, deep blue
  Slumber'd unfathomable, and the stars
  Were flooded over with clear glory and pale.
  I gaz'd upon the sheeny coast beyond,
  There where the Giant of old Time infixed
  The limits of his prowess, pillars high
  Long time eras'd from Earth: even as the sea
  When weary of wild inroad buildeth up
  Huge mounds whereby to stay his yeasty waves.
  And much I mus'd on legends quaint and old
  Which whilome won the hearts of all on Earth
  Toward their brightness, ev'n as flame draws air;
  But had their being in the heart of Man
  As air is th' life of flame: and thou wert then
  A center'd glory--circled Memory,
  Divinest Atalantis, whom the waves
  Have buried deep, and thou of later name
  Imperial Eldorado roof'd with gold:
  Shadows to which, despite all shocks of Change,
  All on-set of capricious Accident,
  Men clung with yearning Hope which would not die.
  As when in some great City where the walls
  Shake, and the streets with ghastly faces throng'd
  Do utter forth a subterranean voice,
  Among the inner columns far retir'd
  At midnight, in the lone Acropolis.
  Before the awful Genius of the place
  Kneels the pale Priestess in deep faith, the while
  Above her head the weak lamp dips and winks
  Unto the fearful summoning without:
  Nathless she ever clasps the marble knees,
  Bathes the cold hand with tears, and gazeth on
  Those eyes which wear no light but that wherewith
  Her phantasy informs them. Where are ye
  Thrones of the Western wave, fair Islands green?
  Where are your moonlight halls, your cedarn glooms,
  The blossoming abysses of your hills?
  Your flowering Capes and your gold-sanded bays
  Blown round with happy airs of odorous winds?
  Where are the infinite ways which, Seraph-trod,
  Wound thro' your great Elysian solitudes,
  Whose lowest depths were, as with visible love,
  Fill'd with Divine effulgence, circumfus'd,
  Flowing between the clear and polish'd stems,
  And ever circling round their emerald cones
  In coronals and glories, such as gird
  The unfading foreheads of the Saints in Heaven?
  For nothing visible, they say, had birth
  In that blest ground but it was play'd about
  With its peculiar glory. Then I rais'd
  My voice and cried "Wide Afric, doth thy Sun
  Lighten, thy hills enfold a City as fair
  As those which starr'd the night o' the Elder World?
  Or is the rumour of thy Timbuctoo
  A dream as frail as those of ancient Time?"
  A curve of whitening, flashing, ebbing light!
  A rustling of white wings! The bright descent
  Of a young Seraph! and he stood beside me
  There on the ridge, and look'd into my face
  With his unutterable, shining orbs,
  So that with hasty motion I did veil
  My vision with both hands, and saw before me
  Such colour'd spots as dance athwart the eyes
  Of those that gaze upon the noonday Sun.
  Girt with a Zone of flashing gold beneath
  His breast, and compass'd round about his brow
  With triple arch of everchanging bows,
  And circled with the glory of living light
  And alternation of all hues, he stood.

  "O child of man, why muse you here alone
  Upon the Mountain, on the dreams of old
  Which fill'd the Earth with passing loveliness,
  Which flung strange music on the howling winds,
  And odours rapt from remote Paradise?
  Thy sense is clogg'd with dull mortality,
  Thy spirit fetter'd with the bond of clay:
  Open thine eye and see." I look'd, but not
  Upon his face, for it was wonderful
  With its exceeding brightness, and the light
  Of the great angel mind which look'd from out
  The starry glowing of his restless eyes.
  I felt my soul grow mighty, and my spirit
  With supernatural excitation bound
  Within me, and my mental eye grew large
  With such a vast circumference of thought,
  That in my vanity I seem'd to stand
  Upon the outward verge and bound alone
  Of full beautitude. Each failing sense
  As with a momentary flash of light
  Grew thrillingly distinct and keen. I saw
  The smallest grain that dappled the dark Earth,
  The indistinctest atom in deep air,
  The Moon's white cities, and the opal width
  Of her small glowing lakes, her silver heights
  Unvisited with dew of vagrant cloud,
  And the unsounded, undescended depth
  Of her black hollows. The clear Galaxy
  Shorn of its hoary lustre, wonderful,
  Distinct and vivid with sharp points of light
  Blaze within blaze, an unimagin'd depth
  And harmony of planet-girded Suns
  And moon-encircled planets, wheel in wheel,
  Arch'd the wan Sapphire. Nay, the hum of men,
  Or other things talking in unknown tongues,
  And notes of busy life in distant worlds
  Beat like a far wave on my anxious ear.
  A maze of piercing, trackless, thrilling thoughts
  Involving and embracing each with each
  Rapid as fire, inextricably link'd,
  Expanding momently with every sight
  And sound which struck the palpitating sense,
  The issue of strong impulse, hurried through
  The riv'n rapt brain: as when in some large lake
  From pressure of descendant crags, which lapse
  Disjointed, crumbling from their parent slope
  At slender interval, the level calm
  Is ridg'd with restless and increasing spheres
  Which break upon each other, each th' effect
  Of separate impulse, but more fleet and strong
  Than its precursor, till the eye in vain
  Amid the wild unrest of swimming shade
  Dappled with hollow and alternate rise
  Of interpenetrated arc, would scan
  Definite round.

                  I know not if I shape
  These things with accurate similitude
  From visible objects, for but dimly now,
  Less vivid than a half-forgotten dream,
  The memory of that mental excellence
  Comes o'er me, and it may be I entwine
  The indecision of my present mind
  With its past clearness, yet it seems to me
  As even then the torrent of quick thought
  Absorbed me from the nature of itself
  With its own fleetness. Where is he that borne
  Adown the sloping of an arrowy stream,
  Could link his shallop to the fleeting edge,
  And muse midway with philosophic calm
  Upon the wondrous laws which regulate
  The fierceness of the bounding element?
  My thoughts which long had grovell'd in the slime
  Of this dull world, like dusky worms which house
  Beneath unshaken waters, but at once
  Upon some earth-awakening day of spring
  Do pass from gloom to glory, and aloft
  Winnow the purple, bearing on both sides
  Double display of starlit wings which burn
  Fanlike and fibred, with intensest bloom:
  E'en so my thoughts, ere while so low, now felt
  Unutterable buoyancy and strength
  To bear them upward through the trackless fields
  Of undefin'd existence far and free.

  Then first within the South methought I saw
  A wilderness of spires, and chrystal pile
  Of rampart upon rampart, dome on dome,
  Illimitable range of battlement
  On battlement, and the Imperial height
  Of Canopy o'ercanopied.

                          Behind,
  In diamond light, upsprung the dazzling Cones
  Of Pyramids, as far surpassing Earth's
  As Heaven than Earth is fairer. Each aloft
  Upon his narrow'd Eminence bore globes
  Of wheeling suns, or stars, or semblances
  Of either, showering circular abyss
  Of radiance. But the glory of the place
  Stood out a pillar'd front of burnish'd gold
  Interminably high, if gold it were
  Or metal more ethereal, and beneath
  Two doors of blinding brilliance, where no gaze
  Might rest, stood open, and the eye could scan
  Through length of porch and lake and boundless hall,
  Part of a throne of fiery flame, where from
  The snowy skirting of a garment hung,
  And glimpse of multitudes of multitudes
  That minister'd around it--if I saw
  These things distinctly, for my human brain
  Stagger'd beneath the vision, and thick night
  Came down upon my eyelids, and I fell.

  With ministering hand he rais'd me up;
  Then with a mournful and ineffable smile,
  Which but to look on for a moment fill'd
  My eyes with irresistible sweet tears,
  In accents of majestic melody,
  Like a swol'n river's gushings in still night
  Mingled with floating music, thus he spake:

  "There is no mightier Spirit than I to sway
  The heart of man: and teach him to attain
  By shadowing forth the Unattainable;
  And step by step to scale that mighty stair
  Whose landing-place is wrapt about with clouds
  Of glory of Heaven. [1] With earliest Light of Spring,
  And in the glow of sallow Summertide,
  And in red Autumn when the winds are wild
  With gambols, and when full-voiced Winter roofs
  The headland with inviolate white snow,
  I play about his heart a thousand ways,
  Visit his eyes with visions, and his ears
  With harmonies of wind and wave and wood--
  Of winds which tell of waters, and of waters
  Betraying the close kisses of the wind--
  And win him unto me: and few there be
  So gross of heart who have not felt and known
  A higher than they see: They with dim eyes
  Behold me darkling. Lo! I have given thee
  To understand my presence, and to feel
  My fullness; I have fill'd thy lips with power.
  I have rais'd thee nigher to the Spheres of Heaven,
  Man's first, last home: and thou with ravish'd sense
  Listenest the lordly music flowing from
  Th'illimitable years. I am the Spirit,
  The permeating life which courseth through
  All th' intricate and labyrinthine veins
  Of the great vine of Fable, which, outspread
  With growth of shadowing leaf and clusters rare,
  Reacheth to every corner under Heaven,
  Deep-rooted in the living soil of truth:
  So that men's hopes and fears take refuge in
  The fragrance of its complicated glooms
  And cool impleached twilights. Child of Man,
  See'st thou yon river, whose translucent wave,
  Forth issuing from darkness, windeth through
  The argent streets o' the City, imaging
  The soft inversion of her tremulous Domes.
  Her gardens frequent with the stately Palm,
  Her Pagods hung with music of sweet bells.
  Her obelisks of ranged Chrysolite,
  Minarets and towers? Lo! how he passeth by,
  And gulphs himself in sands, as not enduring
  To carry through the world those waves, which bore
  The reflex of my City in their depths.
  Oh City! Oh latest Throne! where I was rais'd
  To be a mystery of loveliness
  Unto all eyes, the time is well nigh come
  When I must render up this glorious home
  To keen 'Discovery': soon yon brilliant towers
  Shall darken with the waving of her wand;
  Darken, and shrink and shiver into huts,
  Black specks amid a waste of dreary sand,
  Low-built, mud-wall'd, Barbarian settlement,
  How chang'd from this fair City!"

                                    Thus far the Spirit:
  Then parted Heavenward on the wing: and I
  Was left alone on Calpe, and the Moon
  Had fallen from the night, and all was dark!

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
  www.gutenberg.org/license.


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a
copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon
request, of the work in its original "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other
form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8.  You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org


Section 3.  Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive
Foundation

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

  Dedication


  These to His Memory--since he held them dear,
  Perchance as finding there unconsciously
  Some image of himself--I dedicate,
  I dedicate, I consecrate with tears--
  These Idylls.

               And indeed He seems to me
  Scarce other than my king's ideal knight,
  'Who reverenced his conscience as his king;
  Whose glory was, redressing human wrong;
  Who spake no slander, no, nor listened to it;
  Who loved one only and who clave to her--'
  Her--over all whose realms to their last isle,
  Commingled with the gloom of imminent war,
  The shadow of His loss drew like eclipse,
  Darkening the world.  We have lost him:  he is gone:
  We know him now:  all narrow jealousies
  Are silent; and we see him as he moved,
  How modest, kindly, all-accomplished, wise,
  With what sublime repression of himself,
  And in what limits, and how tenderly;
  Not swaying to this faction or to that;
  Not making his high place the lawless perch
  Of winged ambitions, nor a vantage-ground
  For pleasure; but through all this tract of years
  Wearing the white flower of a blameless life,
  Before a thousand peering littlenesses,
  In that fierce light which beats upon a throne,
  And blackens every blot:  for where is he,
  Who dares foreshadow for an only son
  A lovelier life, a more unstained, than his?
  Or how should England dreaming of his sons
  Hope more for these than some inheritance
  Of such a life, a heart, a mind as thine,
  Thou noble Father of her Kings to be,
  Laborious for her people and her poor--
  Voice in the rich dawn of an ampler day--
  Far-sighted summoner of War and Waste
  To fruitful strifes and rivalries of peace--
  Sweet nature gilded by the gracious gleam
  Of letters, dear to Science, dear to Art,
  Dear to thy land and ours, a Prince indeed,
  Beyond all titles, and a household name,
  Hereafter, through all times, Albert the Good.

     Break not, O woman's-heart, but still endure;
  Break not, for thou art Royal, but endure,
  Remembering all the beauty of that star
  Which shone so close beside Thee that ye made
  One light together, but has past and leaves
  The Crown a lonely splendour.

                               May all love,
  His love, unseen but felt, o'ershadow Thee,
  The love of all Thy sons encompass Thee,
  The love of all Thy daughters cherish Thee,
  The love of all Thy people comfort Thee,
  Till God's love set Thee at his side again!



  The Coming of Arthur

  Leodogran, the King of Cameliard,
  Had one fair daughter, and none other child;
  And she was the fairest of all flesh on earth,
  Guinevere, and in her his one delight.

     For many a petty king ere Arthur came
  Ruled in this isle, and ever waging war
  Each upon other, wasted all the land;
  And still from time to time the heathen host
  Swarmed overseas, and harried what was left.
  And so there grew great tracts of wilderness,
  Wherein the beast was ever more and more,
  But man was less and less, till Arthur came.
  For first Aurelius lived and fought and died,
  And after him King Uther fought and died,
  But either failed to make the kingdom one.
  And after these King Arthur for a space,
  And through the puissance of his Table Round,
  Drew all their petty princedoms under him.
  Their king and head, and made a realm, and reigned.

     And thus the land of Cameliard was waste,
  Thick with wet woods, and many a beast therein,
  And none or few to scare or chase the beast;
  So that wild dog, and wolf and boar and bear
  Came night and day, and rooted in the fields,
  And wallowed in the gardens of the King.
  And ever and anon the wolf would steal
  The children and devour, but now and then,
  Her own brood lost or dead, lent her fierce teat
  To human sucklings; and the children, housed
  In her foul den, there at their meat would growl,
  And mock their foster mother on four feet,
  Till, straightened, they grew up to wolf-like men,
  Worse than the wolves.  And King Leodogran
  Groaned for the Roman legions here again,
  And Caesar's eagle:  then his brother king,
  Urien, assailed him:  last a heathen horde,
  Reddening the sun with smoke and earth with blood,
  And on the spike that split the mother's heart
  Spitting the child, brake on him, till, amazed,
  He knew not whither he should turn for aid.

     But--for he heard of Arthur newly crowned,
  Though not without an uproar made by those
  Who cried, 'He is not Uther's son'--the King
  Sent to him, saying, 'Arise, and help us thou!
  For here between the man and beast we die.'

     And Arthur yet had done no deed of arms,
  But heard the call, and came:  and Guinevere
  Stood by the castle walls to watch him pass;
  But since he neither wore on helm or shield
  The golden symbol of his kinglihood,
  But rode a simple knight among his knights,
  And many of these in richer arms than he,
  She saw him not, or marked not, if she saw,
  One among many, though his face was bare.
  But Arthur, looking downward as he past,
  Felt the light of her eyes into his life
  Smite on the sudden, yet rode on, and pitched
  His tents beside the forest.  Then he drave
  The heathen; after, slew the beast, and felled
  The forest, letting in the sun, and made
  Broad pathways for the hunter and the knight
  And so returned.

                  For while he lingered there,
  A doubt that ever smouldered in the hearts
  Of those great Lords and Barons of his realm
  Flashed forth and into war:  for most of these,
  Colleaguing with a score of petty kings,
  Made head against him, crying, 'Who is he
  That he should rule us? who hath proven him
  King Uther's son? for lo! we look at him,
  And find nor face nor bearing, limbs nor voice,
  Are like to those of Uther whom we knew.
  This is the son of Gorlois, not the King;
  This is the son of Anton, not the King.'

     And Arthur, passing thence to battle, felt
  Travail, and throes and agonies of the life,
  Desiring to be joined with Guinevere;
  And thinking as he rode, 'Her father said
  That there between the man and beast they die.
  Shall I not lift her from this land of beasts
  Up to my throne, and side by side with me?
  What happiness to reign a lonely king,
  Vext--O ye stars that shudder over me,
  O earth that soundest hollow under me,
  Vext with waste dreams? for saving I be joined
  To her that is the fairest under heaven,
  I seem as nothing in the mighty world,
  And cannot will my will, nor work my work
  Wholly, nor make myself in mine own realm
  Victor and lord.  But were I joined with her,
  Then might we live together as one life,
  And reigning with one will in everything
  Have power on this dark land to lighten it,
  And power on this dead world to make it live.'

     Thereafter--as he speaks who tells the tale--
  When Arthur reached a field-of-battle bright
  With pitched pavilions of his foe, the world
  Was all so clear about him, that he saw
  The smallest rock far on the faintest hill,
  And even in high day the morning star.
  So when the King had set his banner broad,
  At once from either side, with trumpet-blast,
  And shouts, and clarions shrilling unto blood,
  The long-lanced battle let their horses run.
  And now the Barons and the kings prevailed,
  And now the King, as here and there that war
  Went swaying; but the Powers who walk the world
  Made lightnings and great thunders over him,
  And dazed all eyes, till Arthur by main might,
  And mightier of his hands with every blow,
  And leading all his knighthood threw the kings
  Carados, Urien, Cradlemont of Wales,
  Claudias, and Clariance of Northumberland,
  The King Brandagoras of Latangor,
  With Anguisant of Erin, Morganore,
  And Lot of Orkney.  Then, before a voice
  As dreadful as the shout of one who sees
  To one who sins, and deems himself alone
  And all the world asleep, they swerved and brake
  Flying, and Arthur called to stay the brands
  That hacked among the flyers, 'Ho! they yield!'
  So like a painted battle the war stood
  Silenced, the living quiet as the dead,
  And in the heart of Arthur joy was lord.
  He laughed upon his warrior whom he loved
  And honoured most.  'Thou dost not doubt me King,
  So well thine arm hath wrought for me today.'
  'Sir and my liege,' he cried, 'the fire of God
  Descends upon thee in the battle-field:
  I know thee for my King!'  Whereat the two,
  For each had warded either in the fight,
  Sware on the field of death a deathless love.
  And Arthur said, 'Man's word is God in man:
  Let chance what will, I trust thee to the death.'

     Then quickly from the foughten field he sent
  Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere,
  His new-made knights, to King Leodogran,
  Saying, 'If I in aught have served thee well,
  Give me thy daughter Guinevere to wife.'

     Whom when he heard, Leodogran in heart
  Debating--'How should I that am a king,
  However much he holp me at my need,
  Give my one daughter saving to a king,
  And a king's son?'--lifted his voice, and called
  A hoary man, his chamberlain, to whom
  He trusted all things, and of him required
  His counsel:  'Knowest thou aught of Arthur's birth?'

     Then spake the hoary chamberlain and said,
  'Sir King, there be but two old men that know:
  And each is twice as old as I; and one
  Is Merlin, the wise man that ever served
  King Uther through his magic art; and one
  Is Merlin's master (so they call him) Bleys,
  Who taught him magic, but the scholar ran
  Before the master, and so far, that Bleys,
  Laid magic by, and sat him down, and wrote
  All things and whatsoever Merlin did
  In one great annal-book, where after-years
  Will learn the secret of our Arthur's birth.'

     To whom the King Leodogran replied,
  'O friend, had I been holpen half as well
  By this King Arthur as by thee today,
  Then beast and man had had their share of me:
  But summon here before us yet once more
  Ulfius, and Brastias, and Bedivere.'

     Then, when they came before him, the King said,
  'I have seen the cuckoo chased by lesser fowl,
  And reason in the chase:  but wherefore now
  Do these your lords stir up the heat of war,
  Some calling Arthur born of Gorlois,
  Others of Anton?  Tell me, ye yourselves,
  Hold ye this Arthur for King Uther's son?'

     And Ulfius and Brastias answered, 'Ay.'
  Then Bedivere, the first of all his knights
  Knighted by Arthur at his crowning, spake--
  For bold in heart and act and word was he,
  Whenever slander breathed against the King--

     'Sir, there be many rumours on this head:
  For there be those who hate him in their hearts,
  Call him baseborn, and since his ways are sweet,
  And theirs are bestial, hold him less than man:
  And there be those who deem him more than man,
  And dream he dropt from heaven:  but my belief
  In all this matter--so ye care to learn--
  Sir, for ye know that in King Uther's time
  The prince and warrior Gorlois, he that held
  Tintagil castle by the Cornish sea,
  Was wedded with a winsome wife, Ygerne:
  And daughters had she borne him,--one whereof,
  Lot's wife, the Queen of Orkney, Bellicent,
  Hath ever like a loyal sister cleaved
  To Arthur,--but a son she had not borne.
  And Uther cast upon her eyes of love:
  But she, a stainless wife to Gorlois,
  So loathed the bright dishonour of his love,
  That Gorlois and King Uther went to war:
  And overthrown was Gorlois and slain.
  Then Uther in his wrath and heat besieged
  Ygerne within Tintagil, where her men,
  Seeing the mighty swarm about their walls,
  Left her and fled, and Uther entered in,
  And there was none to call to but himself.
  So, compassed by the power of the King,
  Enforced was she to wed him in her tears,
  And with a shameful swiftness:  afterward,
  Not many moons, King Uther died himself,
  Moaning and wailing for an heir to rule
  After him, lest the realm should go to wrack.
  And that same night, the night of the new year,
  By reason of the bitterness and grief
  That vext his mother, all before his time
  Was Arthur born, and all as soon as born
  Delivered at a secret postern-gate
  To Merlin, to be holden far apart
  Until his hour should come; because the lords
  Of that fierce day were as the lords of this,
  Wild beasts, and surely would have torn the child
  Piecemeal among them, had they known; for each
  But sought to rule for his own self and hand,
  And many hated Uther for the sake
  Of Gorlois.  Wherefore Merlin took the child,
  And gave him to Sir Anton, an old knight
  And ancient friend of Uther; and his wife
  Nursed the young prince, and reared him with her own;
  And no man knew.  And ever since the lords
  Have foughten like wild beasts among themselves,
  So that the realm has gone to wrack:  but now,
  This year, when Merlin (for his hour had come)
  Brought Arthur forth, and set him in the hall,
  Proclaiming, "Here is Uther's heir, your king,"
  A hundred voices cried, "Away with him!
  No king of ours! a son of Gorlois he,
  Or else the child of Anton, and no king,
  Or else baseborn."  Yet Merlin through his craft,
  And while the people clamoured for a king,
  Had Arthur crowned; but after, the great lords
  Banded, and so brake out in open war.'

     Then while the King debated with himself
  If Arthur were the child of shamefulness,
  Or born the son of Gorlois, after death,
  Or Uther's son, and born before his time,
  Or whether there were truth in anything
  Said by these three, there came to Cameliard,
  With Gawain and young Modred, her two sons,
  Lot's wife, the Queen of Orkney, Bellicent;
  Whom as he could, not as he would, the King
  Made feast for, saying, as they sat at meat,

     'A doubtful throne is ice on summer seas.
  Ye come from Arthur's court.  Victor his men
  Report him!  Yea, but ye--think ye this king--
  So many those that hate him, and so strong,
  So few his knights, however brave they be--
  Hath body enow to hold his foemen down?'

     'O King,' she cried, 'and I will tell thee:  few,
  Few, but all brave, all of one mind with him;
  For I was near him when the savage yells
  Of Uther's peerage died, and Arthur sat
  Crowned on the dais, and his warriors cried,
  "Be thou the king, and we will work thy will
  Who love thee."  Then the King in low deep tones,
  And simple words of great authority,
  Bound them by so strait vows to his own self,
  That when they rose, knighted from kneeling, some
  Were pale as at the passing of a ghost,
  Some flushed, and others dazed, as one who wakes
  Half-blinded at the coming of a light.

     'But when he spake and cheered his Table Round
  With large, divine, and comfortable words,
  Beyond my tongue to tell thee--I beheld
  From eye to eye through all their Order flash
  A momentary likeness of the King:
  And ere it left their faces, through the cross
  And those around it and the Crucified,
  Down from the casement over Arthur, smote
  Flame-colour, vert and azure, in three rays,
  One falling upon each of three fair queens,
  Who stood in silence near his throne, the friends
  Of Arthur, gazing on him, tall, with bright
  Sweet faces, who will help him at his need.

     'And there I saw mage Merlin, whose vast wit
  And hundred winters are but as the hands
  Of loyal vassals toiling for their liege.

     'And near him stood the Lady of the Lake,
  Who knows a subtler magic than his own--
  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful.
  She gave the King his huge cross-hilted sword,
  Whereby to drive the heathen out:  a mist
  Of incense curled about her, and her face
  Wellnigh was hidden in the minster gloom;
  But there was heard among the holy hymns
  A voice as of the waters, for she dwells
  Down in a deep; calm, whatsoever storms
  May shake the world, and when the surface rolls,
  Hath power to walk the waters like our Lord.

     'There likewise I beheld Excalibur
  Before him at his crowning borne, the sword
  That rose from out the bosom of the lake,
  And Arthur rowed across and took it--rich
  With jewels, elfin Urim, on the hilt,
  Bewildering heart and eye--the blade so bright
  That men are blinded by it--on one side,
  Graven in the oldest tongue of all this world,
  "Take me," but turn the blade and ye shall see,
  And written in the speech ye speak yourself,
  "Cast me away!"  And sad was Arthur's face
  Taking it, but old Merlin counselled him,
  "Take thou and strike! the time to cast away
  Is yet far-off."  So this great brand the king
  Took, and by this will beat his foemen down.'

     Thereat Leodogran rejoiced, but thought
  To sift his doubtings to the last, and asked,
  Fixing full eyes of question on her face,
  'The swallow and the swift are near akin,
  But thou art closer to this noble prince,
  Being his own dear sister;' and she said,
  'Daughter of Gorlois and Ygerne am I;'
  'And therefore Arthur's sister?' asked the King.
  She answered, 'These be secret things,' and signed
  To those two sons to pass, and let them be.
  And Gawain went, and breaking into song
  Sprang out, and followed by his flying hair
  Ran like a colt, and leapt at all he saw:
  But Modred laid his ear beside the doors,
  And there half-heard; the same that afterward
  Struck for the throne, and striking found his doom.

     And then the Queen made answer, 'What know I?
  For dark my mother was in eyes and hair,
  And dark in hair and eyes am I; and dark
  Was Gorlois, yea and dark was Uther too,
  Wellnigh to blackness; but this King is fair
  Beyond the race of Britons and of men.
  Moreover, always in my mind I hear
  A cry from out the dawning of my life,
  A mother weeping, and I hear her say,
  "O that ye had some brother, pretty one,
  To guard thee on the rough ways of the world."'

     'Ay,' said the King, 'and hear ye such a cry?
  But when did Arthur chance upon thee first?'

     'O King!' she cried, 'and I will tell thee true:
  He found me first when yet a little maid:
  Beaten I had been for a little fault
  Whereof I was not guilty; and out I ran
  And flung myself down on a bank of heath,
  And hated this fair world and all therein,
  And wept, and wished that I were dead; and he--
  I know not whether of himself he came,
  Or brought by Merlin, who, they say, can walk
  Unseen at pleasure--he was at my side,
  And spake sweet words, and comforted my heart,
  And dried my tears, being a child with me.
  And many a time he came, and evermore
  As I grew greater grew with me; and sad
  At times he seemed, and sad with him was I,
  Stern too at times, and then I loved him not,
  But sweet again, and then I loved him well.
  And now of late I see him less and less,
  But those first days had golden hours for me,
  For then I surely thought he would be king.

     'But let me tell thee now another tale:
  For Bleys, our Merlin's master, as they say,
  Died but of late, and sent his cry to me,
  To hear him speak before he left his life.
  Shrunk like a fairy changeling lay the mage;
  And when I entered told me that himself
  And Merlin ever served about the King,
  Uther, before he died; and on the night
  When Uther in Tintagil past away
  Moaning and wailing for an heir, the two
  Left the still King, and passing forth to breathe,
  Then from the castle gateway by the chasm
  Descending through the dismal night--a night
  In which the bounds of heaven and earth were lost--
  Beheld, so high upon the dreary deeps
  It seemed in heaven, a ship, the shape thereof
  A dragon winged, and all from stern to stern
  Bright with a shining people on the decks,
  And gone as soon as seen.  And then the two
  Dropt to the cove, and watched the great sea fall,
  Wave after wave, each mightier than the last,
  Till last, a ninth one, gathering half the deep
  And full of voices, slowly rose and plunged
  Roaring, and all the wave was in a flame:
  And down the wave and in the flame was borne
  A naked babe, and rode to Merlin's feet,
  Who stoopt and caught the babe, and cried "The King!
  Here is an heir for Uther!"  And the fringe
  Of that great breaker, sweeping up the strand,
  Lashed at the wizard as he spake the word,
  And all at once all round him rose in fire,
  So that the child and he were clothed in fire.
  And presently thereafter followed calm,
  Free sky and stars:  "And this the same child," he said,
  "Is he who reigns; nor could I part in peace
  Till this were told."  And saying this the seer
  Went through the strait and dreadful pass of death,
  Not ever to be questioned any more
  Save on the further side; but when I met
  Merlin, and asked him if these things were truth--
  The shining dragon and the naked child
  Descending in the glory of the seas--
  He laughed as is his wont, and answered me
  In riddling triplets of old time, and said:

     '"Rain, rain, and sun! a rainbow in the sky!
  A young man will be wiser by and by;
  An old man's wit may wander ere he die.
     Rain, rain, and sun! a rainbow on the lea!
  And truth is this to me, and that to thee;
  And truth or clothed or naked let it be.
     Rain, sun, and rain! and the free blossom blows:
  Sun, rain, and sun! and where is he who knows?
  From the great deep to the great deep he goes."

     'So Merlin riddling angered me; but thou
  Fear not to give this King thy only child,
  Guinevere:  so great bards of him will sing
  Hereafter; and dark sayings from of old
  Ranging and ringing through the minds of men,
  And echoed by old folk beside their fires
  For comfort after their wage-work is done,
  Speak of the King; and Merlin in our time
  Hath spoken also, not in jest, and sworn
  Though men may wound him that he will not die,
  But pass, again to come; and then or now
  Utterly smite the heathen underfoot,
  Till these and all men hail him for their king.'

     She spake and King Leodogran rejoiced,
  But musing, 'Shall I answer yea or nay?'
  Doubted, and drowsed, nodded and slept, and saw,
  Dreaming, a slope of land that ever grew,
  Field after field, up to a height, the peak
  Haze-hidden, and thereon a phantom king,
  Now looming, and now lost; and on the slope
  The sword rose, the hind fell, the herd was driven,
  Fire glimpsed; and all the land from roof and rick,
  In drifts of smoke before a rolling wind,
  Streamed to the peak, and mingled with the haze
  And made it thicker; while the phantom king
  Sent out at times a voice; and here or there
  Stood one who pointed toward the voice, the rest
  Slew on and burnt, crying, 'No king of ours,
  No son of Uther, and no king of ours;'
  Till with a wink his dream was changed, the haze
  Descended, and the solid earth became
  As nothing, but the King stood out in heaven,
  Crowned.  And Leodogran awoke, and sent
  Ulfius, and Brastias and Bedivere,
  Back to the court of Arthur answering yea.

     Then Arthur charged his warrior whom he loved
  And honoured most, Sir Lancelot, to ride forth
  And bring the Queen;--and watched him from the gates:
  And Lancelot past away among the flowers,
  (For then was latter April) and returned
  Among the flowers, in May, with Guinevere.
  To whom arrived, by Dubric the high saint,
  Chief of the church in Britain, and before
  The stateliest of her altar-shrines, the King
  That morn was married, while in stainless white,
  The fair beginners of a nobler time,
  And glorying in their vows and him, his knights
  Stood around him, and rejoicing in his joy.
  Far shone the fields of May through open door,
  The sacred altar blossomed white with May,
  The Sun of May descended on their King,
  They gazed on all earth's beauty in their Queen,
  Rolled incense, and there past along the hymns
  A voice as of the waters, while the two
  Sware at the shrine of Christ a deathless love:
  And Arthur said, 'Behold, thy doom is mine.
  Let chance what will, I love thee to the death!'
  To whom the Queen replied with drooping eyes,
  'King and my lord, I love thee to the death!'
  And holy Dubric spread his hands and spake,
  'Reign ye, and live and love, and make the world
  Other, and may thy Queen be one with thee,
  And all this Order of thy Table Round
  Fulfil the boundless purpose of their King!'

     So Dubric said; but when they left the shrine
  Great Lords from Rome before the portal stood,
  In scornful stillness gazing as they past;
  Then while they paced a city all on fire
  With sun and cloth of gold, the trumpets blew,
  And Arthur's knighthood sang before the King:--

     'Blow, trumpet, for the world is white with May;
  Blow trumpet, the long night hath rolled away!
  Blow through the living world--"Let the King reign."

     'Shall Rome or Heathen rule in Arthur's realm?
  Flash brand and lance, fall battleaxe upon helm,
  Fall battleaxe, and flash brand!  Let the King reign.

     'Strike for the King and live! his knights have heard
  That God hath told the King a secret word.
  Fall battleaxe, and flash brand!  Let the King reign.

     'Blow trumpet! he will lift us from the dust.
  Blow trumpet! live the strength and die the lust!
  Clang battleaxe, and clash brand!  Let the King reign.

     'Strike for the King and die! and if thou diest,
  The King is King, and ever wills the highest.
  Clang battleaxe, and clash brand!  Let the King reign.

     'Blow, for our Sun is mighty in his May!
  Blow, for our Sun is mightier day by day!
  Clang battleaxe, and clash brand!  Let the King reign.

     'The King will follow Christ, and we the King
  In whom high God hath breathed a secret thing.
  Fall battleaxe, and flash brand!  Let the King reign.'

     So sang the knighthood, moving to their hall.
  There at the banquet those great Lords from Rome,
  The slowly-fading mistress of the world,
  Strode in, and claimed their tribute as of yore.
  But Arthur spake, 'Behold, for these have sworn
  To wage my wars, and worship me their King;
  The old order changeth, yielding place to new;
  And we that fight for our fair father Christ,
  Seeing that ye be grown too weak and old
  To drive the heathen from your Roman wall,
  No tribute will we pay:' so those great lords
  Drew back in wrath, and Arthur strove with Rome.

     And Arthur and his knighthood for a space
  Were all one will, and through that strength the King
  Drew in the petty princedoms under him,
  Fought, and in twelve great battles overcame
  The heathen hordes, and made a realm and reigned.



  Gareth and Lynette

  The last tall son of Lot and Bellicent,
  And tallest, Gareth, in a showerful spring
  Stared at the spate.  A slender-shafted Pine
  Lost footing, fell, and so was whirled away.
  'How he went down,' said Gareth, 'as a false knight
  Or evil king before my lance if lance
  Were mine to use--O senseless cataract,
  Bearing all down in thy precipitancy--
  And yet thou art but swollen with cold snows
  And mine is living blood:  thou dost His will,
  The Maker's, and not knowest, and I that know,
  Have strength and wit, in my good mother's hall
  Linger with vacillating obedience,
  Prisoned, and kept and coaxed and whistled to--
  Since the good mother holds me still a child!
  Good mother is bad mother unto me!
  A worse were better; yet no worse would I.
  Heaven yield her for it, but in me put force
  To weary her ears with one continuous prayer,
  Until she let me fly discaged to sweep
  In ever-highering eagle-circles up
  To the great Sun of Glory, and thence swoop
  Down upon all things base, and dash them dead,
  A knight of Arthur, working out his will,
  To cleanse the world.  Why, Gawain, when he came
  With Modred hither in the summertime,
  Asked me to tilt with him, the proven knight.
  Modred for want of worthier was the judge.
  Then I so shook him in the saddle, he said,
  "Thou hast half prevailed against me," said so--he--
  Though Modred biting his thin lips was mute,
  For he is alway sullen:  what care I?'

     And Gareth went, and hovering round her chair
  Asked, 'Mother, though ye count me still the child,
  Sweet mother, do ye love the child?'  She laughed,
  'Thou art but a wild-goose to question it.'
  'Then, mother, an ye love the child,' he said,
  'Being a goose and rather tame than wild,
  Hear the child's story.'  'Yea, my well-beloved,
  An 'twere but of the goose and golden eggs.'

     And Gareth answered her with kindling eyes,
  'Nay, nay, good mother, but this egg of mine
  Was finer gold than any goose can lay;
  For this an Eagle, a royal Eagle, laid
  Almost beyond eye-reach, on such a palm
  As glitters gilded in thy Book of Hours.
  And there was ever haunting round the palm
  A lusty youth, but poor, who often saw
  The splendour sparkling from aloft, and thought
  "An I could climb and lay my hand upon it,
  Then were I wealthier than a leash of kings."
  But ever when he reached a hand to climb,
  One, that had loved him from his childhood, caught
  And stayed him, "Climb not lest thou break thy neck,
  I charge thee by my love," and so the boy,
  Sweet mother, neither clomb, nor brake his neck,
  But brake his very heart in pining for it,
  And past away.'

                 To whom the mother said,
  'True love, sweet son, had risked himself and climbed,
  And handed down the golden treasure to him.'

     And Gareth answered her with kindling eyes,
  'Gold?' said I gold?--ay then, why he, or she,
  Or whosoe'er it was, or half the world
  Had ventured--had the thing I spake of been
  Mere gold--but this was all of that true steel,
  Whereof they forged the brand Excalibur,
  And lightnings played about it in the storm,
  And all the little fowl were flurried at it,
  And there were cries and clashings in the nest,
  That sent him from his senses:  let me go.'

     Then Bellicent bemoaned herself and said,
  'Hast thou no pity upon my loneliness?
  Lo, where thy father Lot beside the hearth
  Lies like a log, and all but smouldered out!
  For ever since when traitor to the King
  He fought against him in the Barons' war,
  And Arthur gave him back his territory,
  His age hath slowly droopt, and now lies there
  A yet-warm corpse, and yet unburiable,
  No more; nor sees, nor hears, nor speaks, nor knows.
  And both thy brethren are in Arthur's hall,
  Albeit neither loved with that full love
  I feel for thee, nor worthy such a love:
  Stay therefore thou; red berries charm the bird,
  And thee, mine innocent, the jousts, the wars,
  Who never knewest finger-ache, nor pang
  Of wrenched or broken limb--an often chance
  In those brain-stunning shocks, and tourney-falls,
  Frights to my heart; but stay:  follow the deer
  By these tall firs and our fast-falling burns;
  So make thy manhood mightier day by day;
  Sweet is the chase:  and I will seek thee out
  Some comfortable bride and fair, to grace
  Thy climbing life, and cherish my prone year,
  Till falling into Lot's forgetfulness
  I know not thee, myself, nor anything.
  Stay, my best son! ye are yet more boy than man.'

     Then Gareth, 'An ye hold me yet for child,
  Hear yet once more the story of the child.
  For, mother, there was once a King, like ours.
  The prince his heir, when tall and marriageable,
  Asked for a bride; and thereupon the King
  Set two before him.  One was fair, strong, armed--
  But to be won by force--and many men
  Desired her; one good lack, no man desired.
  And these were the conditions of the King:
  That save he won the first by force, he needs
  Must wed that other, whom no man desired,
  A red-faced bride who knew herself so vile,
  That evermore she longed to hide herself,
  Nor fronted man or woman, eye to eye--
  Yea--some she cleaved to, but they died of her.
  And one--they called her Fame; and one,--O Mother,
  How can ye keep me tethered to you--Shame.
  Man am I grown, a man's work must I do.
  Follow the deer? follow the Christ, the King,
  Live pure, speak true, right wrong, follow the King--
  Else, wherefore born?'

                        To whom the mother said
  'Sweet son, for there be many who deem him not,
  Or will not deem him, wholly proven King--
  Albeit in mine own heart I knew him King,
  When I was frequent with him in my youth,
  And heard him Kingly speak, and doubted him
  No more than he, himself; but felt him mine,
  Of closest kin to me:  yet--wilt thou leave
  Thine easeful biding here, and risk thine all,
  Life, limbs, for one that is not proven King?
  Stay, till the cloud that settles round his birth
  Hath lifted but a little.  Stay, sweet son.'

     And Gareth answered quickly, 'Not an hour,
  So that ye yield me--I will walk through fire,
  Mother, to gain it--your full leave to go.
  Not proven, who swept the dust of ruined Rome
  From off the threshold of the realm, and crushed
  The Idolaters, and made the people free?
  Who should be King save him who makes us free?'

     So when the Queen, who long had sought in vain
  To break him from the intent to which he grew,
  Found her son's will unwaveringly one,
  She answered craftily, 'Will ye walk through fire?
  Who walks through fire will hardly heed the smoke.
  Ay, go then, an ye must:  only one proof,
  Before thou ask the King to make thee knight,
  Of thine obedience and thy love to me,
  Thy mother,--I demand.

                        And Gareth cried,
  'A hard one, or a hundred, so I go.
  Nay--quick! the proof to prove me to the quick!'

     But slowly spake the mother looking at him,
  'Prince, thou shalt go disguised to Arthur's hall,
  And hire thyself to serve for meats and drinks
  Among the scullions and the kitchen-knaves,
  And those that hand the dish across the bar.
  Nor shalt thou tell thy name to anyone.
  And thou shalt serve a twelvemonth and a day.'

     For so the Queen believed that when her son
  Beheld his only way to glory lead
  Low down through villain kitchen-vassalage,
  Her own true Gareth was too princely-proud
  To pass thereby; so should he rest with her,
  Closed in her castle from the sound of arms.

     Silent awhile was Gareth, then replied,
  'The thrall in person may be free in soul,
  And I shall see the jousts.  Thy son am I,
  And since thou art my mother, must obey.
  I therefore yield me freely to thy will;
  For hence will I, disguised, and hire myself
  To serve with scullions and with kitchen-knaves;
  Nor tell my name to any--no, not the King.'

     Gareth awhile lingered.  The mother's eye
  Full of the wistful fear that he would go,
  And turning toward him wheresoe'er he turned,
  Perplext his outward purpose, till an hour,
  When wakened by the wind which with full voice
  Swept bellowing through the darkness on to dawn,
  He rose, and out of slumber calling two
  That still had tended on him from his birth,
  Before the wakeful mother heard him, went.

     The three were clad like tillers of the soil.
  Southward they set their faces.  The birds made
  Melody on branch, and melody in mid air.
  The damp hill-slopes were quickened into green,
  And the live green had kindled into flowers,
  For it was past the time of Easterday.

     So, when their feet were planted on the plain
  That broadened toward the base of Camelot,
  Far off they saw the silver-misty morn
  Rolling her smoke about the Royal mount,
  That rose between the forest and the field.
  At times the summit of the high city flashed;
  At times the spires and turrets half-way down
  Pricked through the mist; at times the great gate shone
  Only, that opened on the field below:
  Anon, the whole fair city had disappeared.

     Then those who went with Gareth were amazed,
  One crying, 'Let us go no further, lord.
  Here is a city of Enchanters, built
  By fairy Kings.'  The second echoed him,
  'Lord, we have heard from our wise man at home
  To Northward, that this King is not the King,
  But only changeling out of Fairyland,
  Who drave the heathen hence by sorcery
  And Merlin's glamour.'  Then the first again,
  'Lord, there is no such city anywhere,
  But all a vision.'

                    Gareth answered them
  With laughter, swearing he had glamour enow
  In his own blood, his princedom, youth and hopes,
  To plunge old Merlin in the Arabian sea;
  So pushed them all unwilling toward the gate.
  And there was no gate like it under heaven.
  For barefoot on the keystone, which was lined
  And rippled like an ever-fleeting wave,
  The Lady of the Lake stood:  all her dress
  Wept from her sides as water flowing away;
  But like the cross her great and goodly arms
  Stretched under the cornice and upheld:
  And drops of water fell from either hand;
  And down from one a sword was hung, from one
  A censer, either worn with wind and storm;
  And o'er her breast floated the sacred fish;
  And in the space to left of her, and right,
  Were Arthur's wars in weird devices done,
  New things and old co-twisted, as if Time
  Were nothing, so inveterately, that men
  Were giddy gazing there; and over all
  High on the top were those three Queens, the friends
  Of Arthur, who should help him at his need.

     Then those with Gareth for so long a space
  Stared at the figures, that at last it seemed
  The dragon-boughts and elvish emblemings
  Began to move, seethe, twine and curl:  they called
  To Gareth, 'Lord, the gateway is alive.'

     And Gareth likewise on them fixt his eyes
  So long, that even to him they seemed to move.
  Out of the city a blast of music pealed.
  Back from the gate started the three, to whom
  From out thereunder came an ancient man,
  Long-bearded, saying, 'Who be ye, my sons?'

     Then Gareth, 'We be tillers of the soil,
  Who leaving share in furrow come to see
  The glories of our King:  but these, my men,
  (Your city moved so weirdly in the mist)
  Doubt if the King be King at all, or come
  From Fairyland; and whether this be built
  By magic, and by fairy Kings and Queens;
  Or whether there be any city at all,
  Or all a vision:  and this music now
  Hath scared them both, but tell thou these the truth.'

     Then that old Seer made answer playing on him
  And saying, 'Son, I have seen the good ship sail
  Keel upward, and mast downward, in the heavens,
  And solid turrets topsy-turvy in air:
  And here is truth; but an it please thee not,
  Take thou the truth as thou hast told it me.
  For truly as thou sayest, a Fairy King
  And Fairy Queens have built the city, son;
  They came from out a sacred mountain-cleft
  Toward the sunrise, each with harp in hand,
  And built it to the music of their harps.
  And, as thou sayest, it is enchanted, son,
  For there is nothing in it as it seems
  Saving the King; though some there be that hold
  The King a shadow, and the city real:
  Yet take thou heed of him, for, so thou pass
  Beneath this archway, then wilt thou become
  A thrall to his enchantments, for the King
  Will bind thee by such vows, as is a shame
  A man should not be bound by, yet the which
  No man can keep; but, so thou dread to swear,
  Pass not beneath this gateway, but abide
  Without, among the cattle of the field.
  For an ye heard a music, like enow
  They are building still, seeing the city is built
  To music, therefore never built at all,
  And therefore built for ever.'

                                Gareth spake
  Angered, 'Old master, reverence thine own beard
  That looks as white as utter truth, and seems
  Wellnigh as long as thou art statured tall!
  Why mockest thou the stranger that hath been
  To thee fair-spoken?'

                       But the Seer replied,
  'Know ye not then the Riddling of the Bards?
  "Confusion, and illusion, and relation,
  Elusion, and occasion, and evasion"?
  I mock thee not but as thou mockest me,
  And all that see thee, for thou art not who
  Thou seemest, but I know thee who thou art.
  And now thou goest up to mock the King,
  Who cannot brook the shadow of any lie.'

     Unmockingly the mocker ending here
  Turned to the right, and past along the plain;
  Whom Gareth looking after said, 'My men,
  Our one white lie sits like a little ghost
  Here on the threshold of our enterprise.
  Let love be blamed for it, not she, nor I:
  Well, we will make amends.'

                             With all good cheer
  He spake and laughed, then entered with his twain
  Camelot, a city of shadowy palaces
  And stately, rich in emblem and the work
  Of ancient kings who did their days in stone;
  Which Merlin's hand, the Mage at Arthur's court,
  Knowing all arts, had touched, and everywhere
  At Arthur's ordinance, tipt with lessening peak
  And pinnacle, and had made it spire to heaven.
  And ever and anon a knight would pass
  Outward, or inward to the hall:  his arms
  Clashed; and the sound was good to Gareth's ear.
  And out of bower and casement shyly glanced
  Eyes of pure women, wholesome stars of love;
  And all about a healthful people stept
  As in the presence of a gracious king.

     Then into hall Gareth ascending heard
  A voice, the voice of Arthur, and beheld
  Far over heads in that long-vaulted hall
  The splendour of the presence of the King
  Throned, and delivering doom--and looked no more--
  But felt his young heart hammering in his ears,
  And thought, 'For this half-shadow of a lie
  The truthful King will doom me when I speak.'
  Yet pressing on, though all in fear to find
  Sir Gawain or Sir Modred, saw nor one
  Nor other, but in all the listening eyes
  Of those tall knights, that ranged about the throne,
  Clear honour shining like the dewy star
  Of dawn, and faith in their great King, with pure
  Affection, and the light of victory,
  And glory gained, and evermore to gain.
     Then came a widow crying to the King,
  'A boon, Sir King!  Thy father, Uther, reft
  From my dead lord a field with violence:
  For howsoe'er at first he proffered gold,
  Yet, for the field was pleasant in our eyes,
  We yielded not; and then he reft us of it
  Perforce, and left us neither gold nor field.'

     Said Arthur, 'Whether would ye? gold or field?'
  To whom the woman weeping, 'Nay, my lord,
  The field was pleasant in my husband's eye.'

     And Arthur, 'Have thy pleasant field again,
  And thrice the gold for Uther's use thereof,
  According to the years.  No boon is here,
  But justice, so thy say be proven true.
  Accursed, who from the wrongs his father did
  Would shape himself a right!'

                               And while she past,
  Came yet another widow crying to him,
  'A boon, Sir King!  Thine enemy, King, am I.
  With thine own hand thou slewest my dear lord,
  A knight of Uther in the Barons' war,
  When Lot and many another rose and fought
  Against thee, saying thou wert basely born.
  I held with these, and loathe to ask thee aught.
  Yet lo! my husband's brother had my son
  Thralled in his castle, and hath starved him dead;
  And standeth seized of that inheritance
  Which thou that slewest the sire hast left the son.
  So though I scarce can ask it thee for hate,
  Grant me some knight to do the battle for me,
  Kill the foul thief, and wreak me for my son.'

     Then strode a good knight forward, crying to him,
  'A boon, Sir King!  I am her kinsman, I.
  Give me to right her wrong, and slay the man.'

     Then came Sir Kay, the seneschal, and cried,
  'A boon, Sir King! even that thou grant her none,
  This railer, that hath mocked thee in full hall--
  None; or the wholesome boon of gyve and gag.'

     But Arthur, 'We sit King, to help the wronged
  Through all our realm.  The woman loves her lord.
  Peace to thee, woman, with thy loves and hates!
  The kings of old had doomed thee to the flames,
  Aurelius Emrys would have scourged thee dead,
  And Uther slit thy tongue:  but get thee hence--
  Lest that rough humour of the kings of old
  Return upon me!  Thou that art her kin,
  Go likewise; lay him low and slay him not,
  But bring him here, that I may judge the right,
  According to the justice of the King:
  Then, be he guilty, by that deathless King
  Who lived and died for men, the man shall die.'

     Then came in hall the messenger of Mark,
  A name of evil savour in the land,
  The Cornish king.  In either hand he bore
  What dazzled all, and shone far-off as shines
  A field of charlock in the sudden sun
  Between two showers, a cloth of palest gold,
  Which down he laid before the throne, and knelt,
  Delivering, that his lord, the vassal king,
  Was even upon his way to Camelot;
  For having heard that Arthur of his grace
  Had made his goodly cousin, Tristram, knight,
  And, for himself was of the greater state,
  Being a king, he trusted his liege-lord
  Would yield him this large honour all the more;
  So prayed him well to accept this cloth of gold,
  In token of true heart and fealty.

     Then Arthur cried to rend the cloth, to rend
  In pieces, and so cast it on the hearth.
  An oak-tree smouldered there.  'The goodly knight!
  What! shall the shield of Mark stand among these?'
  For, midway down the side of that long hall
  A stately pile,--whereof along the front,
  Some blazoned, some but carven, and some blank,
  There ran a treble range of stony shields,--
  Rose, and high-arching overbrowed the hearth.
  And under every shield a knight was named:
  For this was Arthur's custom in his hall;
  When some good knight had done one noble deed,
  His arms were carven only; but if twain
  His arms were blazoned also; but if none,
  The shield was blank and bare without a sign
  Saving the name beneath; and Gareth saw
  The shield of Gawain blazoned rich and bright,
  And Modred's blank as death; and Arthur cried
  To rend the cloth and cast it on the hearth.

     'More like are we to reave him of his crown
  Than make him knight because men call him king.
  The kings we found, ye know we stayed their hands
  From war among themselves, but left them kings;
  Of whom were any bounteous, merciful,
  Truth-speaking, brave, good livers, them we enrolled
  Among us, and they sit within our hall.
  But as Mark hath tarnished the great name of king,
  As Mark would sully the low state of churl:
  And, seeing he hath sent us cloth of gold,
  Return, and meet, and hold him from our eyes,
  Lest we should lap him up in cloth of lead,
  Silenced for ever--craven--a man of plots,
  Craft, poisonous counsels, wayside ambushings--
  No fault of thine:  let Kay the seneschal
  Look to thy wants, and send thee satisfied--
  Accursed, who strikes nor lets the hand be seen!'

     And many another suppliant crying came
  With noise of ravage wrought by beast and man,
  And evermore a knight would ride away.

     Last, Gareth leaning both hands heavily
  Down on the shoulders of the twain, his men,
  Approached between them toward the King, and asked,
  'A boon, Sir King (his voice was all ashamed),
  For see ye not how weak and hungerworn
  I seem--leaning on these? grant me to serve
  For meat and drink among thy kitchen-knaves
  A twelvemonth and a day, nor seek my name.
  Hereafter I will fight.'

                          To him the King,
  'A goodly youth and worth a goodlier boon!
  But so thou wilt no goodlier, then must Kay,
  The master of the meats and drinks, be thine.'

     He rose and past; then Kay, a man of mien
  Wan-sallow as the plant that feels itself
  Root-bitten by white lichen,

                              'Lo ye now!
  This fellow hath broken from some Abbey, where,
  God wot, he had not beef and brewis enow,
  However that might chance! but an he work,
  Like any pigeon will I cram his crop,
  And sleeker shall he shine than any hog.'

     Then Lancelot standing near, 'Sir Seneschal,
  Sleuth-hound thou knowest, and gray, and all the hounds;
  A horse thou knowest, a man thou dost not know:
  Broad brows and fair, a fluent hair and fine,
  High nose, a nostril large and fine, and hands
  Large, fair and fine!--Some young lad's mystery--
  But, or from sheepcot or king's hall, the boy
  Is noble-natured.  Treat him with all grace,
  Lest he should come to shame thy judging of him.'

     Then Kay, 'What murmurest thou of mystery?
  Think ye this fellow will poison the King's dish?
  Nay, for he spake too fool-like:  mystery!
  Tut, an the lad were noble, he had asked
  For horse and armour:  fair and fine, forsooth!
  Sir Fine-face, Sir Fair-hands? but see thou to it
  That thine own fineness, Lancelot, some fine day
  Undo thee not--and leave my man to me.'

     So Gareth all for glory underwent
  The sooty yoke of kitchen-vassalage;
  Ate with young lads his portion by the door,
  And couched at night with grimy kitchen-knaves.
  And Lancelot ever spake him pleasantly,
  But Kay the seneschal, who loved him not,
  Would hustle and harry him, and labour him
  Beyond his comrade of the hearth, and set
  To turn the broach, draw water, or hew wood,
  Or grosser tasks; and Gareth bowed himself
  With all obedience to the King, and wrought
  All kind of service with a noble ease
  That graced the lowliest act in doing it.
  And when the thralls had talk among themselves,
  And one would praise the love that linkt the King
  And Lancelot--how the King had saved his life
  In battle twice, and Lancelot once the King's--
  For Lancelot was the first in Tournament,
  But Arthur mightiest on the battle-field--
  Gareth was glad.  Or if some other told,
  How once the wandering forester at dawn,
  Far over the blue tarns and hazy seas,
  On Caer-Eryri's highest found the King,
  A naked babe, of whom the Prophet spake,
  'He passes to the Isle Avilion,
  He passes and is healed and cannot die'--
  Gareth was glad.  But if their talk were foul,
  Then would he whistle rapid as any lark,
  Or carol some old roundelay, and so loud
  That first they mocked, but, after, reverenced him.
  Or Gareth telling some prodigious tale
  Of knights, who sliced a red life-bubbling way
  Through twenty folds of twisted dragon, held
  All in a gap-mouthed circle his good mates
  Lying or sitting round him, idle hands,
  Charmed; till Sir Kay, the seneschal, would come
  Blustering upon them, like a sudden wind
  Among dead leaves, and drive them all apart.
  Or when the thralls had sport among themselves,
  So there were any trial of mastery,
  He, by two yards in casting bar or stone
  Was counted best; and if there chanced a joust,
  So that Sir Kay nodded him leave to go,
  Would hurry thither, and when he saw the knights
  Clash like the coming and retiring wave,
  And the spear spring, and good horse reel, the boy
  Was half beyond himself for ecstasy.

     So for a month he wrought among the thralls;
  But in the weeks that followed, the good Queen,
  Repentant of the word she made him swear,
  And saddening in her childless castle, sent,
  Between the in-crescent and de-crescent moon,
  Arms for her son, and loosed him from his vow.

     This, Gareth hearing from a squire of Lot
  With whom he used to play at tourney once,
  When both were children, and in lonely haunts
  Would scratch a ragged oval on the sand,
  And each at either dash from either end--
  Shame never made girl redder than Gareth joy.
  He laughed; he sprang.  'Out of the smoke, at once
  I leap from Satan's foot to Peter's knee--
  These news be mine, none other's--nay, the King's--
  Descend into the city:' whereon he sought
  The King alone, and found, and told him all.

     'I have staggered thy strong Gawain in a tilt
  For pastime; yea, he said it:  joust can I.
  Make me thy knight--in secret! let my name
  Be hidden, and give me the first quest, I spring
  Like flame from ashes.'

                         Here the King's calm eye
  Fell on, and checked, and made him flush, and bow
  Lowly, to kiss his hand, who answered him,
  'Son, the good mother let me know thee here,
  And sent her wish that I would yield thee thine.
  Make thee my knight? my knights are sworn to vows
  Of utter hardihood, utter gentleness,
  And, loving, utter faithfulness in love,
  And uttermost obedience to the King.'

     Then Gareth, lightly springing from his knees,
  'My King, for hardihood I can promise thee.
  For uttermost obedience make demand
  Of whom ye gave me to, the Seneschal,
  No mellow master of the meats and drinks!
  And as for love, God wot, I love not yet,
  But love I shall, God willing.'

                                 And the King
  'Make thee my knight in secret? yea, but he,
  Our noblest brother, and our truest man,
  And one with me in all, he needs must know.'

     'Let Lancelot know, my King, let Lancelot know,
  Thy noblest and thy truest!'

                              And the King--
  'But wherefore would ye men should wonder at you?
  Nay, rather for the sake of me, their King,
  And the deed's sake my knighthood do the deed,
  Than to be noised of.'

                        Merrily Gareth asked,
  'Have I not earned my cake in baking of it?
  Let be my name until I make my name!
  My deeds will speak:  it is but for a day.'
  So with a kindly hand on Gareth's arm
  Smiled the great King, and half-unwillingly
  Loving his lusty youthhood yielded to him.
  Then, after summoning Lancelot privily,
  'I have given him the first quest:  he is not proven.
  Look therefore when he calls for this in hall,
  Thou get to horse and follow him far away.
  Cover the lions on thy shield, and see
  Far as thou mayest, he be nor ta'en nor slain.'

     Then that same day there past into the hall
  A damsel of high lineage, and a brow
  May-blossom, and a cheek of apple-blossom,
  Hawk-eyes; and lightly was her slender nose
  Tip-tilted like the petal of a flower;
  She into hall past with her page and cried,

     'O King, for thou hast driven the foe without,
  See to the foe within! bridge, ford, beset
  By bandits, everyone that owns a tower
  The Lord for half a league.  Why sit ye there?
  Rest would I not, Sir King, an I were king,
  Till even the lonest hold were all as free
  From cursed bloodshed, as thine altar-cloth
  From that best blood it is a sin to spill.'

     'Comfort thyself,' said Arthur.  'I nor mine
  Rest:  so my knighthood keep the vows they swore,
  The wastest moorland of our realm shall be
  Safe, damsel, as the centre of this hall.
  What is thy name? thy need?'

                              'My name?' she said--
  'Lynette my name; noble; my need, a knight
  To combat for my sister, Lyonors,
  A lady of high lineage, of great lands,
  And comely, yea, and comelier than myself.
  She lives in Castle Perilous:  a river
  Runs in three loops about her living-place;
  And o'er it are three passings, and three knights
  Defend the passings, brethren, and a fourth
  And of that four the mightiest, holds her stayed
  In her own castle, and so besieges her
  To break her will, and make her wed with him:
  And but delays his purport till thou send
  To do the battle with him, thy chief man
  Sir Lancelot whom he trusts to overthrow,
  Then wed, with glory:  but she will not wed
  Save whom she loveth, or a holy life.
  Now therefore have I come for Lancelot.'

     Then Arthur mindful of Sir Gareth asked,
  'Damsel, ye know this Order lives to crush
  All wrongers of the Realm.  But say, these four,
  Who be they?  What the fashion of the men?'

     'They be of foolish fashion, O Sir King,
  The fashion of that old knight-errantry
  Who ride abroad, and do but what they will;
  Courteous or bestial from the moment, such
  As have nor law nor king; and three of these
  Proud in their fantasy call themselves the Day,
  Morning-Star, and Noon-Sun, and Evening-Star,
  Being strong fools; and never a whit more wise
  The fourth, who alway rideth armed in black,
  A huge man-beast of boundless savagery.
  He names himself the Night and oftener Death,
  And wears a helmet mounted with a skull,
  And bears a skeleton figured on his arms,
  To show that who may slay or scape the three,
  Slain by himself, shall enter endless night.
  And all these four be fools, but mighty men,
  And therefore am I come for Lancelot.'

     Hereat Sir Gareth called from where he rose,
  A head with kindling eyes above the throng,
  'A boon, Sir King--this quest!' then--for he marked
  Kay near him groaning like a wounded bull--
  'Yea, King, thou knowest thy kitchen-knave am I,
  And mighty through thy meats and drinks am I,
  And I can topple over a hundred such.
  Thy promise, King,' and Arthur glancing at him,
  Brought down a momentary brow.  'Rough, sudden,
  And pardonable, worthy to be knight--
  Go therefore,' and all hearers were amazed.

     But on the damsel's forehead shame, pride, wrath
  Slew the May-white:  she lifted either arm,
  'Fie on thee, King! I asked for thy chief knight,
  And thou hast given me but a kitchen-knave.'
  Then ere a man in hall could stay her, turned,
  Fled down the lane of access to the King,
  Took horse, descended the slope street, and past
  The weird white gate, and paused without, beside
  The field of tourney, murmuring 'kitchen-knave.'

     Now two great entries opened from the hall,
  At one end one, that gave upon a range
  Of level pavement where the King would pace
  At sunrise, gazing over plain and wood;
  And down from this a lordly stairway sloped
  Till lost in blowing trees and tops of towers;
  And out by this main doorway past the King.
  But one was counter to the hearth, and rose
  High that the highest-crested helm could ride
  Therethrough nor graze:  and by this entry fled
  The damsel in her wrath, and on to this
  Sir Gareth strode, and saw without the door
  King Arthur's gift, the worth of half a town,
  A warhorse of the best, and near it stood
  The two that out of north had followed him:
  This bare a maiden shield, a casque; that held
  The horse, the spear; whereat Sir Gareth loosed
  A cloak that dropt from collar-bone to heel,
  A cloth of roughest web, and cast it down,
  And from it like a fuel-smothered fire,
  That lookt half-dead, brake bright, and flashed as those
  Dull-coated things, that making slide apart
  Their dusk wing-cases, all beneath there burns
  A jewelled harness, ere they pass and fly.
  So Gareth ere he parted flashed in arms.
  Then as he donned the helm, and took the shield
  And mounted horse and graspt a spear, of grain
  Storm-strengthened on a windy site, and tipt
  With trenchant steel, around him slowly prest
  The people, while from out of kitchen came
  The thralls in throng, and seeing who had worked
  Lustier than any, and whom they could but love,
  Mounted in arms, threw up their caps and cried,
  'God bless the King, and all his fellowship!'
  And on through lanes of shouting Gareth rode
  Down the slope street, and past without the gate.

     So Gareth past with joy; but as the cur
  Pluckt from the cur he fights with, ere his cause
  Be cooled by fighting, follows, being named,
  His owner, but remembers all, and growls
  Remembering, so Sir Kay beside the door
  Muttered in scorn of Gareth whom he used
  To harry and hustle.

                      'Bound upon a quest
  With horse and arms--the King hath past his time--
  My scullion knave!  Thralls to your work again,
  For an your fire be low ye kindle mine!
  Will there be dawn in West and eve in East?
  Begone!--my knave!--belike and like enow
  Some old head-blow not heeded in his youth
  So shook his wits they wander in his prime--
  Crazed!  How the villain lifted up his voice,
  Nor shamed to bawl himself a kitchen-knave.
  Tut:  he was tame and meek enow with me,
  Till peacocked up with Lancelot's noticing.
  Well--I will after my loud knave, and learn
  Whether he know me for his master yet.
  Out of the smoke he came, and so my lance
  Hold, by God's grace, he shall into the mire--
  Thence, if the King awaken from his craze,
  Into the smoke again.'

                        But Lancelot said,
  'Kay, wherefore wilt thou go against the King,
  For that did never he whereon ye rail,
  But ever meekly served the King in thee?
  Abide:  take counsel; for this lad is great
  And lusty, and knowing both of lance and sword.'
  'Tut, tell not me,' said Kay, 'ye are overfine
  To mar stout knaves with foolish courtesies:'
  Then mounted, on through silent faces rode
  Down the slope city, and out beyond the gate.

     But by the field of tourney lingering yet
  Muttered the damsel, 'Wherefore did the King
  Scorn me? for, were Sir Lancelot lackt, at least
  He might have yielded to me one of those
  Who tilt for lady's love and glory here,
  Rather than--O sweet heaven!  O fie upon him--
  His kitchen-knave.'

                     To whom Sir Gareth drew
  (And there were none but few goodlier than he)
  Shining in arms, 'Damsel, the quest is mine.
  Lead, and I follow.'  She thereat, as one
  That smells a foul-fleshed agaric in the holt,
  And deems it carrion of some woodland thing,
  Or shrew, or weasel, nipt her slender nose
  With petulant thumb and finger, shrilling, 'Hence!
  Avoid, thou smellest all of kitchen-grease.
  And look who comes behind,' for there was Kay.
  'Knowest thou not me? thy master? I am Kay.
  We lack thee by the hearth.'

                              And Gareth to him,
  'Master no more! too well I know thee, ay--
  The most ungentle knight in Arthur's hall.'
  'Have at thee then,' said Kay:  they shocked, and Kay
  Fell shoulder-slipt, and Gareth cried again,
  'Lead, and I follow,' and fast away she fled.

     But after sod and shingle ceased to fly
  Behind her, and the heart of her good horse
  Was nigh to burst with violence of the beat,
  Perforce she stayed, and overtaken spoke.

     'What doest thou, scullion, in my fellowship?
  Deem'st thou that I accept thee aught the more
  Or love thee better, that by some device
  Full cowardly, or by mere unhappiness,
  Thou hast overthrown and slain thy master--thou!--
  Dish-washer and broach-turner, loon!--to me
  Thou smellest all of kitchen as before.'

     'Damsel,' Sir Gareth answered gently, 'say
  Whate'er ye will, but whatsoe'er ye say,
  I leave not till I finish this fair quest,
  Or die therefore.'

                    'Ay, wilt thou finish it?
  Sweet lord, how like a noble knight he talks!
  The listening rogue hath caught the manner of it.
  But, knave, anon thou shalt be met with, knave,
  And then by such a one that thou for all
  The kitchen brewis that was ever supt
  Shalt not once dare to look him in the face.'

     'I shall assay,' said Gareth with a smile
  That maddened her, and away she flashed again
  Down the long avenues of a boundless wood,
  And Gareth following was again beknaved.

     'Sir Kitchen-knave, I have missed the only way
  Where Arthur's men are set along the wood;
  The wood is nigh as full of thieves as leaves:
  If both be slain, I am rid of thee; but yet,
  Sir Scullion, canst thou use that spit of thine?
  Fight, an thou canst:  I have missed the only way.'

     So till the dusk that followed evensong
  Rode on the two, reviler and reviled;
  Then after one long slope was mounted, saw,
  Bowl-shaped, through tops of many thousand pines
  A gloomy-gladed hollow slowly sink
  To westward--in the deeps whereof a mere,
  Round as the red eye of an Eagle-owl,
  Under the half-dead sunset glared; and shouts
  Ascended, and there brake a servingman
  Flying from out of the black wood, and crying,
  'They have bound my lord to cast him in the mere.'
  Then Gareth, 'Bound am I to right the wronged,
  But straitlier bound am I to bide with thee.'
  And when the damsel spake contemptuously,
  'Lead, and I follow,' Gareth cried again,
  'Follow, I lead!' so down among the pines
  He plunged; and there, blackshadowed nigh the mere,
  And mid-thigh-deep in bulrushes and reed,
  Saw six tall men haling a seventh along,
  A stone about his neck to drown him in it.
  Three with good blows he quieted, but three
  Fled through the pines; and Gareth loosed the stone
  From off his neck, then in the mere beside
  Tumbled it; oilily bubbled up the mere.
  Last, Gareth loosed his bonds and on free feet
  Set him, a stalwart Baron, Arthur's friend.

     'Well that ye came, or else these caitiff rogues
  Had wreaked themselves on me; good cause is theirs
  To hate me, for my wont hath ever been
  To catch my thief, and then like vermin here
  Drown him, and with a stone about his neck;
  And under this wan water many of them
  Lie rotting, but at night let go the stone,
  And rise, and flickering in a grimly light
  Dance on the mere.  Good now, ye have saved a life
  Worth somewhat as the cleanser of this wood.
  And fain would I reward thee worshipfully.
  What guerdon will ye?'
                        Gareth sharply spake,
  'None! for the deed's sake have I done the deed,
  In uttermost obedience to the King.
  But wilt thou yield this damsel harbourage?'

     Whereat the Baron saying, 'I well believe
  You be of Arthur's Table,' a light laugh
  Broke from Lynette, 'Ay, truly of a truth,
  And in a sort, being Arthur's kitchen-knave!--
  But deem not I accept thee aught the more,
  Scullion, for running sharply with thy spit
  Down on a rout of craven foresters.
  A thresher with his flail had scattered them.
  Nay--for thou smellest of the kitchen still.
  But an this lord will yield us harbourage,
  Well.'

        So she spake.  A league beyond the wood,
  All in a full-fair manor and a rich,
  His towers where that day a feast had been
  Held in high hall, and many a viand left,
  And many a costly cate, received the three.
  And there they placed a peacock in his pride
  Before the damsel, and the Baron set
  Gareth beside her, but at once she rose.

     'Meseems, that here is much discourtesy,
  Setting this knave, Lord Baron, at my side.
  Hear me--this morn I stood in Arthur's hall,
  And prayed the King would grant me Lancelot
  To fight the brotherhood of Day and Night--
  The last a monster unsubduable
  Of any save of him for whom I called--
  Suddenly bawls this frontless kitchen-knave,
  "The quest is mine; thy kitchen-knave am I,
  And mighty through thy meats and drinks am I."
  Then Arthur all at once gone mad replies,
  "Go therefore," and so gives the quest to him--
  Him--here--a villain fitter to stick swine
  Than ride abroad redressing women's wrong,
  Or sit beside a noble gentlewoman.'

     Then half-ashamed and part-amazed, the lord
  Now looked at one and now at other, left
  The damsel by the peacock in his pride,
  And, seating Gareth at another board,
  Sat down beside him, ate and then began.

     'Friend, whether thou be kitchen-knave, or not,
  Or whether it be the maiden's fantasy,
  And whether she be mad, or else the King,
  Or both or neither, or thyself be mad,
  I ask not:  but thou strikest a strong stroke,
  For strong thou art and goodly therewithal,
  And saver of my life; and therefore now,
  For here be mighty men to joust with, weigh
  Whether thou wilt not with thy damsel back
  To crave again Sir Lancelot of the King.
  Thy pardon; I but speak for thine avail,
  The saver of my life.'

                        And Gareth said,
  'Full pardon, but I follow up the quest,
  Despite of Day and Night and Death and Hell.'

     So when, next morn, the lord whose life he saved
  Had, some brief space, conveyed them on their way
  And left them with God-speed, Sir Gareth spake,
  'Lead, and I follow.'  Haughtily she replied.

     'I fly no more:  I allow thee for an hour.
  Lion and stout have isled together, knave,
  In time of flood.  Nay, furthermore, methinks
  Some ruth is mine for thee.  Back wilt thou, fool?
  For hard by here is one will overthrow
  And slay thee:  then will I to court again,
  And shame the King for only yielding me
  My champion from the ashes of his hearth.'

     To whom Sir Gareth answered courteously,
  'Say thou thy say, and I will do my deed.
  Allow me for mine hour, and thou wilt find
  My fortunes all as fair as hers who lay
  Among the ashes and wedded the King's son.'

     Then to the shore of one of those long loops
  Wherethrough the serpent river coiled, they came.
  Rough-thicketed were the banks and steep; the stream
  Full, narrow; this a bridge of single arc
  Took at a leap; and on the further side
  Arose a silk pavilion, gay with gold
  In streaks and rays, and all Lent-lily in hue,
  Save that the dome was purple, and above,
  Crimson, a slender banneret fluttering.
  And therebefore the lawless warrior paced
  Unarmed, and calling, 'Damsel, is this he,
  The champion thou hast brought from Arthur's hall?
  For whom we let thee pass.'  'Nay, nay,' she said,
  'Sir Morning-Star.  The King in utter scorn
  Of thee and thy much folly hath sent thee here
  His kitchen-knave:  and look thou to thyself:
  See that he fall not on thee suddenly,
  And slay thee unarmed:  he is not knight but knave.'

     Then at his call, 'O daughters of the Dawn,
  And servants of the Morning-Star, approach,
  Arm me,' from out the silken curtain-folds
  Bare-footed and bare-headed three fair girls
  In gilt and rosy raiment came:  their feet
  In dewy grasses glistened; and the hair
  All over glanced with dewdrop or with gem
  Like sparkles in the stone Avanturine.
  These armed him in blue arms, and gave a shield
  Blue also, and thereon the morning star.
  And Gareth silent gazed upon the knight,
  Who stood a moment, ere his horse was brought,
  Glorying; and in the stream beneath him, shone
  Immingled with Heaven's azure waveringly,
  The gay pavilion and the naked feet,
  His arms, the rosy raiment, and the star.

     Then she that watched him, 'Wherefore stare ye so?
  Thou shakest in thy fear:  there yet is time:
  Flee down the valley before he get to horse.
  Who will cry shame?  Thou art not knight but knave.'

     Said Gareth, 'Damsel, whether knave or knight,
  Far liefer had I fight a score of times
  Than hear thee so missay me and revile.
  Fair words were best for him who fights for thee;
  But truly foul are better, for they send
  That strength of anger through mine arms, I know
  That I shall overthrow him.'

                              And he that bore
  The star, when mounted, cried from o'er the bridge,
  'A kitchen-knave, and sent in scorn of me!
  Such fight not I, but answer scorn with scorn.
  For this were shame to do him further wrong
  Than set him on his feet, and take his horse
  And arms, and so return him to the King.
  Come, therefore, leave thy lady lightly, knave.
  Avoid:  for it beseemeth not a knave
  To ride with such a lady.'

                            'Dog, thou liest.
  I spring from loftier lineage than thine own.'
  He spake; and all at fiery speed the two
  Shocked on the central bridge, and either spear
  Bent but not brake, and either knight at once,
  Hurled as a stone from out of a catapult
  Beyond his horse's crupper and the bridge,
  Fell, as if dead; but quickly rose and drew,
  And Gareth lashed so fiercely with his brand
  He drave his enemy backward down the bridge,
  The damsel crying, 'Well-stricken, kitchen-knave!'
  Till Gareth's shield was cloven; but one stroke
  Laid him that clove it grovelling on the ground.

     Then cried the fallen, 'Take not my life:  I yield.'
  And Gareth, 'So this damsel ask it of me
  Good--I accord it easily as a grace.'
  She reddening, 'Insolent scullion:  I of thee?
  I bound to thee for any favour asked!'
  'Then he shall die.'  And Gareth there unlaced
  His helmet as to slay him, but she shrieked,
  'Be not so hardy, scullion, as to slay
  One nobler than thyself.'  'Damsel, thy charge
  Is an abounding pleasure to me.  Knight,
  Thy life is thine at her command.  Arise
  And quickly pass to Arthur's hall, and say
  His kitchen-knave hath sent thee.  See thou crave
  His pardon for thy breaking of his laws.
  Myself, when I return, will plead for thee.
  Thy shield is mine--farewell; and, damsel, thou,
  Lead, and I follow.'

                      And fast away she fled.
  Then when he came upon her, spake, 'Methought,
  Knave, when I watched thee striking on the bridge
  The savour of thy kitchen came upon me
  A little faintlier:  but the wind hath changed:
  I scent it twenty-fold.'  And then she sang,
  '"O morning star" (not that tall felon there
  Whom thou by sorcery or unhappiness
  Or some device, hast foully overthrown),
  "O morning star that smilest in the blue,
  O star, my morning dream hath proven true,
  Smile sweetly, thou! my love hath smiled on me."

     'But thou begone, take counsel, and away,
  For hard by here is one that guards a ford--
  The second brother in their fool's parable--
  Will pay thee all thy wages, and to boot.
  Care not for shame:  thou art not knight but knave.'

     To whom Sir Gareth answered, laughingly,
  'Parables?  Hear a parable of the knave.
  When I was kitchen-knave among the rest
  Fierce was the hearth, and one of my co-mates
  Owned a rough dog, to whom he cast his coat,
  "Guard it," and there was none to meddle with it.
  And such a coat art thou, and thee the King
  Gave me to guard, and such a dog am I,
  To worry, and not to flee--and--knight or knave--
  The knave that doth thee service as full knight
  Is all as good, meseems, as any knight
  Toward thy sister's freeing.'

                               'Ay, Sir Knave!
  Ay, knave, because thou strikest as a knight,
  Being but knave, I hate thee all the more.'

     'Fair damsel, you should worship me the more,
  That, being but knave, I throw thine enemies.'

     'Ay, ay,' she said, 'but thou shalt meet thy match.'

     So when they touched the second river-loop,
  Huge on a huge red horse, and all in mail
  Burnished to blinding, shone the Noonday Sun
  Beyond a raging shallow.  As if the flower,
  That blows a globe of after arrowlets,
  Ten thousand-fold had grown, flashed the fierce shield,
  All sun; and Gareth's eyes had flying blots
  Before them when he turned from watching him.
  He from beyond the roaring shallow roared,
  'What doest thou, brother, in my marches here?'
  And she athwart the shallow shrilled again,
  'Here is a kitchen-knave from Arthur's hall
  Hath overthrown thy brother, and hath his arms.'
  'Ugh!' cried the Sun, and vizoring up a red
  And cipher face of rounded foolishness,
  Pushed horse across the foamings of the ford,
  Whom Gareth met midstream:  no room was there
  For lance or tourney-skill:  four strokes they struck
  With sword, and these were mighty; the new knight
  Had fear he might be shamed; but as the Sun
  Heaved up a ponderous arm to strike the fifth,
  The hoof of his horse slipt in the stream, the stream
  Descended, and the Sun was washed away.

     Then Gareth laid his lance athwart the ford;
  So drew him home; but he that fought no more,
  As being all bone-battered on the rock,
  Yielded; and Gareth sent him to the King,
  'Myself when I return will plead for thee.'
  'Lead, and I follow.'  Quietly she led.
  'Hath not the good wind, damsel, changed again?'
  'Nay, not a point:  nor art thou victor here.
  There lies a ridge of slate across the ford;
  His horse thereon stumbled--ay, for I saw it.

     '"O Sun" (not this strong fool whom thou, Sir Knave,
  Hast overthrown through mere unhappiness),
  "O Sun, that wakenest all to bliss or pain,
  O moon, that layest all to sleep again,
  Shine sweetly:  twice my love hath smiled on me."

     What knowest thou of lovesong or of love?
  Nay, nay, God wot, so thou wert nobly born,
  Thou hast a pleasant presence.  Yea, perchance,--

     '"O dewy flowers that open to the sun,
  O dewy flowers that close when day is done,
  Blow sweetly:  twice my love hath smiled on me."

     'What knowest thou of flowers, except, belike,
  To garnish meats with? hath not our good King
  Who lent me thee, the flower of kitchendom,
  A foolish love for flowers? what stick ye round
  The pasty? wherewithal deck the boar's head?
  Flowers? nay, the boar hath rosemaries and bay.

     '"O birds, that warble to the morning sky,
  O birds that warble as the day goes by,
  Sing sweetly:  twice my love hath smiled on me."

     'What knowest thou of birds, lark, mavis, merle,
  Linnet? what dream ye when they utter forth
  May-music growing with the growing light,
  Their sweet sun-worship? these be for the snare
  (So runs thy fancy) these be for the spit,
  Larding and basting.  See thou have not now
  Larded thy last, except thou turn and fly.
  There stands the third fool of their allegory.'

     For there beyond a bridge of treble bow,
  All in a rose-red from the west, and all
  Naked it seemed, and glowing in the broad
  Deep-dimpled current underneath, the knight,
  That named himself the Star of Evening, stood.

     And Gareth, 'Wherefore waits the madman there
  Naked in open dayshine?'  'Nay,' she cried,
  'Not naked, only wrapt in hardened skins
  That fit him like his own; and so ye cleave
  His armour off him, these will turn the blade.'

     Then the third brother shouted o'er the bridge,
  'O brother-star, why shine ye here so low?
  Thy ward is higher up:  but have ye slain
  The damsel's champion?' and the damsel cried,

     'No star of thine, but shot from Arthur's heaven
  With all disaster unto thine and thee!
  For both thy younger brethren have gone down
  Before this youth; and so wilt thou, Sir Star;
  Art thou not old?'
                    'Old, damsel, old and hard,
  Old, with the might and breath of twenty boys.'
  Said Gareth, 'Old, and over-bold in brag!
  But that same strength which threw the Morning Star
  Can throw the Evening.'

                         Then that other blew
  A hard and deadly note upon the horn.
  'Approach and arm me!'  With slow steps from out
  An old storm-beaten, russet, many-stained
  Pavilion, forth a grizzled damsel came,
  And armed him in old arms, and brought a helm
  With but a drying evergreen for crest,
  And gave a shield whereon the Star of Even
  Half-tarnished and half-bright, his emblem, shone.
  But when it glittered o'er the saddle-bow,
  They madly hurled together on the bridge;
  And Gareth overthrew him, lighted, drew,
  There met him drawn, and overthrew him again,
  But up like fire he started:  and as oft
  As Gareth brought him grovelling on his knees,
  So many a time he vaulted up again;
  Till Gareth panted hard, and his great heart,
  Foredooming all his trouble was in vain,
  Laboured within him, for he seemed as one
  That all in later, sadder age begins
  To war against ill uses of a life,
  But these from all his life arise, and cry,
  'Thou hast made us lords, and canst not put us down!'
  He half despairs; so Gareth seemed to strike
  Vainly, the damsel clamouring all the while,
  'Well done, knave-knight, well-stricken, O good knight-knave--
  O knave, as noble as any of all the knights--
  Shame me not, shame me not.  I have prophesied--
  Strike, thou art worthy of the Table Round--
  His arms are old, he trusts the hardened skin--
  Strike--strike--the wind will never change again.'
  And Gareth hearing ever stronglier smote,
  And hewed great pieces of his armour off him,
  But lashed in vain against the hardened skin,
  And could not wholly bring him under, more
  Than loud Southwesterns, rolling ridge on ridge,
  The buoy that rides at sea, and dips and springs
  For ever; till at length Sir Gareth's brand
  Clashed his, and brake it utterly to the hilt.
  'I have thee now;' but forth that other sprang,
  And, all unknightlike, writhed his wiry arms
  Around him, till he felt, despite his mail,
  Strangled, but straining even his uttermost
  Cast, and so hurled him headlong o'er the bridge
  Down to the river, sink or swim, and cried,
  'Lead, and I follow.'

                       But the damsel said,
  'I lead no longer; ride thou at my side;
  Thou art the kingliest of all kitchen-knaves.

     '"O trefoil, sparkling on the rainy plain,
  O rainbow with three colours after rain,
  Shine sweetly:  thrice my love hath smiled on me."

     'Sir,--and, good faith, I fain had added--Knight,
  But that I heard thee call thyself a knave,--
  Shamed am I that I so rebuked, reviled,
  Missaid thee; noble I am; and thought the King
  Scorned me and mine; and now thy pardon, friend,
  For thou hast ever answered courteously,
  And wholly bold thou art, and meek withal
  As any of Arthur's best, but, being knave,
  Hast mazed my wit:  I marvel what thou art.'

     'Damsel,' he said, 'you be not all to blame,
  Saving that you mistrusted our good King
  Would handle scorn, or yield you, asking, one
  Not fit to cope your quest.  You said your say;
  Mine answer was my deed.  Good sooth!  I hold
  He scarce is knight, yea but half-man, nor meet
  To fight for gentle damsel, he, who lets
  His heart be stirred with any foolish heat
  At any gentle damsel's waywardness.
  Shamed? care not! thy foul sayings fought for me:
  And seeing now thy words are fair, methinks
  There rides no knight, not Lancelot, his great self,
  Hath force to quell me.'
                          Nigh upon that hour
  When the lone hern forgets his melancholy,
  Lets down his other leg, and stretching, dreams
  Of goodly supper in the distant pool,
  Then turned the noble damsel smiling at him,
  And told him of a cavern hard at hand,
  Where bread and baken meats and good red wine
  Of Southland, which the Lady Lyonors
  Had sent her coming champion, waited him.

     Anon they past a narrow comb wherein
  Where slabs of rock with figures, knights on horse
  Sculptured, and deckt in slowly-waning hues.
  'Sir Knave, my knight, a hermit once was here,
  Whose holy hand hath fashioned on the rock
  The war of Time against the soul of man.
  And yon four fools have sucked their allegory
  From these damp walls, and taken but the form.
  Know ye not these?' and Gareth lookt and read--
  In letters like to those the vexillary
  Hath left crag-carven o'er the streaming Gelt--
  'PHOSPHORUS,' then 'MERIDIES'--'HESPERUS'--
  'NOX'--'MORS,' beneath five figures, armed men,
  Slab after slab, their faces forward all,
  And running down the Soul, a Shape that fled
  With broken wings, torn raiment and loose hair,
  For help and shelter to the hermit's cave.
  'Follow the faces, and we find it.  Look,
  Who comes behind?'

                    For one--delayed at first
  Through helping back the dislocated Kay
  To Camelot, then by what thereafter chanced,
  The damsel's headlong error through the wood--
  Sir Lancelot, having swum the river-loops--
  His blue shield-lions covered--softly drew
  Behind the twain, and when he saw the star
  Gleam, on Sir Gareth's turning to him, cried,
  'Stay, felon knight, I avenge me for my friend.'
  And Gareth crying pricked against the cry;
  But when they closed--in a moment--at one touch
  Of that skilled spear, the wonder of the world--
  Went sliding down so easily, and fell,
  That when he found the grass within his hands
  He laughed; the laughter jarred upon Lynette:
  Harshly she asked him, 'Shamed and overthrown,
  And tumbled back into the kitchen-knave,
  Why laugh ye? that ye blew your boast in vain?'
  'Nay, noble damsel, but that I, the son
  Of old King Lot and good Queen Bellicent,
  And victor of the bridges and the ford,
  And knight of Arthur, here lie thrown by whom
  I know not, all through mere unhappiness--
  Device and sorcery and unhappiness--
  Out, sword; we are thrown!'  And Lancelot answered, 'Prince,
  O Gareth--through the mere unhappiness
  Of one who came to help thee, not to harm,
  Lancelot, and all as glad to find thee whole,
  As on the day when Arthur knighted him.'

     Then Gareth, 'Thou--Lancelot!--thine the hand
  That threw me?  An some chance to mar the boast
  Thy brethren of thee make--which could not chance--
  Had sent thee down before a lesser spear,
  Shamed had I been, and sad--O Lancelot--thou!'

     Whereat the maiden, petulant, 'Lancelot,
  Why came ye not, when called? and wherefore now
  Come ye, not called?  I gloried in my knave,
  Who being still rebuked, would answer still
  Courteous as any knight--but now, if knight,
  The marvel dies, and leaves me fooled and tricked,
  And only wondering wherefore played upon:
  And doubtful whether I and mine be scorned.
  Where should be truth if not in Arthur's hall,
  In Arthur's presence?  Knight, knave, prince and fool,
  I hate thee and for ever.'

                            And Lancelot said,
  'Blessed be thou, Sir Gareth! knight art thou
  To the King's best wish.  O damsel, be you wise
  To call him shamed, who is but overthrown?
  Thrown have I been, nor once, but many a time.
  Victor from vanquished issues at the last,
  And overthrower from being overthrown.
  With sword we have not striven; and thy good horse
  And thou are weary; yet not less I felt
  Thy manhood through that wearied lance of thine.
  Well hast thou done; for all the stream is freed,
  And thou hast wreaked his justice on his foes,
  And when reviled, hast answered graciously,
  And makest merry when overthrown.  Prince, Knight
  Hail, Knight and Prince, and of our Table Round!'

     And then when turning to Lynette he told
  The tale of Gareth, petulantly she said,
  'Ay well--ay well--for worse than being fooled
  Of others, is to fool one's self.  A cave,
  Sir Lancelot, is hard by, with meats and drinks
  And forage for the horse, and flint for fire.
  But all about it flies a honeysuckle.
  Seek, till we find.'  And when they sought and found,
  Sir Gareth drank and ate, and all his life
  Past into sleep; on whom the maiden gazed.
  'Sound sleep be thine! sound cause to sleep hast thou.
  Wake lusty!  Seem I not as tender to him
  As any mother?  Ay, but such a one
  As all day long hath rated at her child,
  And vext his day, but blesses him asleep--
  Good lord, how sweetly smells the honeysuckle
  In the hushed night, as if the world were one
  Of utter peace, and love, and gentleness!
  O Lancelot, Lancelot'--and she clapt her hands--
  'Full merry am I to find my goodly knave
  Is knight and noble.  See now, sworn have I,
  Else yon black felon had not let me pass,
  To bring thee back to do the battle with him.
  Thus an thou goest, he will fight thee first;
  Who doubts thee victor? so will my knight-knave
  Miss the full flower of this accomplishment.'

     Said Lancelot, 'Peradventure he, you name,
  May know my shield.  Let Gareth, an he will,
  Change his for mine, and take my charger, fresh,
  Not to be spurred, loving the battle as well
  As he that rides him.'  'Lancelot-like,' she said,
  'Courteous in this, Lord Lancelot, as in all.'

     And Gareth, wakening, fiercely clutched the shield;
  'Ramp ye lance-splintering lions, on whom all spears
  Are rotten sticks! ye seem agape to roar!
  Yea, ramp and roar at leaving of your lord!--
  Care not, good beasts, so well I care for you.
  O noble Lancelot, from my hold on these
  Streams virtue--fire--through one that will not shame
  Even the shadow of Lancelot under shield.
  Hence:  let us go.'

                     Silent the silent field
  They traversed.  Arthur's harp though summer-wan,
  In counter motion to the clouds, allured
  The glance of Gareth dreaming on his liege.
  A star shot:  'Lo,' said Gareth, 'the foe falls!'
  An owl whoopt:  'Hark the victor pealing there!'
  Suddenly she that rode upon his left
  Clung to the shield that Lancelot lent him, crying,
  'Yield, yield him this again:  'tis he must fight:
  I curse the tongue that all through yesterday
  Reviled thee, and hath wrought on Lancelot now
  To lend thee horse and shield:  wonders ye have done;
  Miracles ye cannot:  here is glory enow
  In having flung the three:  I see thee maimed,
  Mangled:  I swear thou canst not fling the fourth.'

     'And wherefore, damsel? tell me all ye know.
  You cannot scare me; nor rough face, or voice,
  Brute bulk of limb, or boundless savagery
  Appal me from the quest.'

                           'Nay, Prince,' she cried,
  'God wot, I never looked upon the face,
  Seeing he never rides abroad by day;
  But watched him have I like a phantom pass
  Chilling the night:  nor have I heard the voice.
  Always he made his mouthpiece of a page
  Who came and went, and still reported him
  As closing in himself the strength of ten,
  And when his anger tare him, massacring
  Man, woman, lad and girl--yea, the soft babe!
  Some hold that he hath swallowed infant flesh,
  Monster!  O Prince, I went for Lancelot first,
  The quest is Lancelot's:  give him back the shield.'

     Said Gareth laughing, 'An he fight for this,
  Belike he wins it as the better man:
  Thus--and not else!'

                      But Lancelot on him urged
  All the devisings of their chivalry
  When one might meet a mightier than himself;
  How best to manage horse, lance, sword and shield,
  And so fill up the gap where force might fail
  With skill and fineness.  Instant were his words.

     Then Gareth, 'Here be rules.  I know but one--
  To dash against mine enemy and win.
  Yet have I seen thee victor in the joust,
  And seen thy way.'  'Heaven help thee,' sighed Lynette.

     Then for a space, and under cloud that grew
  To thunder-gloom palling all stars, they rode
  In converse till she made her palfrey halt,
  Lifted an arm, and softly whispered, 'There.'
  And all the three were silent seeing, pitched
  Beside the Castle Perilous on flat field,
  A huge pavilion like a mountain peak
  Sunder the glooming crimson on the marge,
  Black, with black banner, and a long black horn
  Beside it hanging; which Sir Gareth graspt,
  And so, before the two could hinder him,
  Sent all his heart and breath through all the horn.
  Echoed the walls; a light twinkled; anon
  Came lights and lights, and once again he blew;
  Whereon were hollow tramplings up and down
  And muffled voices heard, and shadows past;
  Till high above him, circled with her maids,
  The Lady Lyonors at a window stood,
  Beautiful among lights, and waving to him
  White hands, and courtesy; but when the Prince
  Three times had blown--after long hush--at last--
  The huge pavilion slowly yielded up,
  Through those black foldings, that which housed therein.
  High on a nightblack horse, in nightblack arms,
  With white breast-bone, and barren ribs of Death,
  And crowned with fleshless laughter--some ten steps--
  In the half-light--through the dim dawn--advanced
  The monster, and then paused, and spake no word.

     But Gareth spake and all indignantly,
  'Fool, for thou hast, men say, the strength of ten,
  Canst thou not trust the limbs thy God hath given,
  But must, to make the terror of thee more,
  Trick thyself out in ghastly imageries
  Of that which Life hath done with, and the clod,
  Less dull than thou, will hide with mantling flowers
  As if for pity?'  But he spake no word;
  Which set the horror higher:  a maiden swooned;
  The Lady Lyonors wrung her hands and wept,
  As doomed to be the bride of Night and Death;
  Sir Gareth's head prickled beneath his helm;
  And even Sir Lancelot through his warm blood felt
  Ice strike, and all that marked him were aghast.

     At once Sir Lancelot's charger fiercely neighed,
  And Death's dark war-horse bounded forward with him.
  Then those that did not blink the terror, saw
  That Death was cast to ground, and slowly rose.
  But with one stroke Sir Gareth split the skull.
  Half fell to right and half to left and lay.
  Then with a stronger buffet he clove the helm
  As throughly as the skull; and out from this
  Issued the bright face of a blooming boy
  Fresh as a flower new-born, and crying, 'Knight,
  Slay me not:  my three brethren bad me do it,
  To make a horror all about the house,
  And stay the world from Lady Lyonors.
  They never dreamed the passes would be past.'
  Answered Sir Gareth graciously to one
  Not many a moon his younger, 'My fair child,
  What madness made thee challenge the chief knight
  Of Arthur's hall?'  'Fair Sir, they bad me do it.
  They hate the King, and Lancelot, the King's friend,
  They hoped to slay him somewhere on the stream,
  They never dreamed the passes could be past.'

     Then sprang the happier day from underground;
  And Lady Lyonors and her house, with dance
  And revel and song, made merry over Death,
  As being after all their foolish fears
  And horrors only proven a blooming boy.
  So large mirth lived and Gareth won the quest.

     And he that told the tale in older times
  Says that Sir Gareth wedded Lyonors,
  But he, that told it later, says Lynette.



  The Marriage of Geraint

  The brave Geraint, a knight of Arthur's court,
  A tributary prince of Devon, one
  Of that great Order of the Table Round,
  Had married Enid, Yniol's only child,
  And loved her, as he loved the light of Heaven.
  And as the light of Heaven varies, now
  At sunrise, now at sunset, now by night
  With moon and trembling stars, so loved Geraint
  To make her beauty vary day by day,
  In crimsons and in purples and in gems.
  And Enid, but to please her husband's eye,
  Who first had found and loved her in a state
  Of broken fortunes, daily fronted him
  In some fresh splendour; and the Queen herself,
  Grateful to Prince Geraint for service done,
  Loved her, and often with her own white hands
  Arrayed and decked her, as the loveliest,
  Next after her own self, in all the court.
  And Enid loved the Queen, and with true heart
  Adored her, as the stateliest and the best
  And loveliest of all women upon earth.
  And seeing them so tender and so close,
  Long in their common love rejoiced Geraint.
  But when a rumour rose about the Queen,
  Touching her guilty love for Lancelot,
  Though yet there lived no proof, nor yet was heard
  The world's loud whisper breaking into storm,
  Not less Geraint believed it; and there fell
  A horror on him, lest his gentle wife,
  Through that great tenderness for Guinevere,
  Had suffered, or should suffer any taint
  In nature:  wherefore going to the King,
  He made this pretext, that his princedom lay
  Close on the borders of a territory,
  Wherein were bandit earls, and caitiff knights,
  Assassins, and all flyers from the hand
  Of Justice, and whatever loathes a law:
  And therefore, till the King himself should please
  To cleanse this common sewer of all his realm,
  He craved a fair permission to depart,
  And there defend his marches; and the King
  Mused for a little on his plea, but, last,
  Allowing it, the Prince and Enid rode,
  And fifty knights rode with them, to the shores
  Of Severn, and they past to their own land;
  Where, thinking, that if ever yet was wife
  True to her lord, mine shall be so to me,
  He compassed her with sweet observances
  And worship, never leaving her, and grew
  Forgetful of his promise to the King,
  Forgetful of the falcon and the hunt,
  Forgetful of the tilt and tournament,
  Forgetful of his glory and his name,
  Forgetful of his princedom and its cares.
  And this forgetfulness was hateful to her.
  And by and by the people, when they met
  In twos and threes, or fuller companies,
  Began to scoff and jeer and babble of him
  As of a prince whose manhood was all gone,
  And molten down in mere uxoriousness.
  And this she gathered from the people's eyes:
  This too the women who attired her head,
  To please her, dwelling on his boundless love,
  Told Enid, and they saddened her the more:
  And day by day she thought to tell Geraint,
  But could not out of bashful delicacy;
  While he that watched her sadden, was the more
  Suspicious that her nature had a taint.

     At last, it chanced that on a summer morn
  (They sleeping each by either) the new sun
  Beat through the blindless casement of the room,
  And heated the strong warrior in his dreams;
  Who, moving, cast the coverlet aside,
  And bared the knotted column of his throat,
  The massive square of his heroic breast,
  And arms on which the standing muscle sloped,
  As slopes a wild brook o'er a little stone,
  Running too vehemently to break upon it.
  And Enid woke and sat beside the couch,
  Admiring him, and thought within herself,
  Was ever man so grandly made as he?
  Then, like a shadow, past the people's talk
  And accusation of uxoriousness
  Across her mind, and bowing over him,
  Low to her own heart piteously she said:

     'O noble breast and all-puissant arms,
  Am I the cause, I the poor cause that men
  Reproach you, saying all your force is gone?
  I am the cause, because I dare not speak
  And tell him what I think and what they say.
  And yet I hate that he should linger here;
  I cannot love my lord and not his name.
  Far liefer had I gird his harness on him,
  And ride with him to battle and stand by,
  And watch his mightful hand striking great blows
  At caitiffs and at wrongers of the world.
  Far better were I laid in the dark earth,
  Not hearing any more his noble voice,
  Not to be folded more in these dear arms,
  And darkened from the high light in his eyes,
  Than that my lord through me should suffer shame.
  Am I so bold, and could I so stand by,
  And see my dear lord wounded in the strife,
  And maybe pierced to death before mine eyes,
  And yet not dare to tell him what I think,
  And how men slur him, saying all his force
  Is melted into mere effeminacy?
  O me, I fear that I am no true wife.'

     Half inwardly, half audibly she spoke,
  And the strong passion in her made her weep
  True tears upon his broad and naked breast,
  And these awoke him, and by great mischance
  He heard but fragments of her later words,
  And that she feared she was not a true wife.
  And then he thought, 'In spite of all my care,
  For all my pains, poor man, for all my pains,
  She is not faithful to me, and I see her
  Weeping for some gay knight in Arthur's hall.'
  Then though he loved and reverenced her too much
  To dream she could be guilty of foul act,
  Right through his manful breast darted the pang
  That makes a man, in the sweet face of her
  Whom he loves most, lonely and miserable.
  At this he hurled his huge limbs out of bed,
  And shook his drowsy squire awake and cried,
  'My charger and her palfrey;' then to her,
  'I will ride forth into the wilderness;
  For though it seems my spurs are yet to win,
  I have not fallen so low as some would wish.
  And thou, put on thy worst and meanest dress
  And ride with me.'  And Enid asked, amazed,
  'If Enid errs, let Enid learn her fault.'
  But he, 'I charge thee, ask not, but obey.'
  Then she bethought her of a faded silk,
  A faded mantle and a faded veil,
  And moving toward a cedarn cabinet,
  Wherein she kept them folded reverently
  With sprigs of summer laid between the folds,
  She took them, and arrayed herself therein,
  Remembering when first he came on her
  Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,
  And all her foolish fears about the dress,
  And all his journey to her, as himself
  Had told her, and their coming to the court.

     For Arthur on the Whitsuntide before
  Held court at old Caerleon upon Usk.
  There on a day, he sitting high in hall,
  Before him came a forester of Dean,
  Wet from the woods, with notice of a hart
  Taller than all his fellows, milky-white,
  First seen that day:  these things he told the King.
  Then the good King gave order to let blow
  His horns for hunting on the morrow morn.
  And when the King petitioned for his leave
  To see the hunt, allowed it easily.
  So with the morning all the court were gone.
  But Guinevere lay late into the morn,
  Lost in sweet dreams, and dreaming of her love
  For Lancelot, and forgetful of the hunt;
  But rose at last, a single maiden with her,
  Took horse, and forded Usk, and gained the wood;
  There, on a little knoll beside it, stayed
  Waiting to hear the hounds; but heard instead
  A sudden sound of hoofs, for Prince Geraint,
  Late also, wearing neither hunting-dress
  Nor weapon, save a golden-hilted brand,
  Came quickly flashing through the shallow ford
  Behind them, and so galloped up the knoll.
  A purple scarf, at either end whereof
  There swung an apple of the purest gold,
  Swayed round about him, as he galloped up
  To join them, glancing like a dragon-fly
  In summer suit and silks of holiday.
  Low bowed the tributary Prince, and she,
  Sweet and statelily, and with all grace
  Of womanhood and queenhood, answered him:
  'Late, late, Sir Prince,' she said, 'later than we!'
  'Yea, noble Queen,' he answered, 'and so late
  That I but come like you to see the hunt,
  Not join it.'  'Therefore wait with me,' she said;
  'For on this little knoll, if anywhere,
  There is good chance that we shall hear the hounds:
  Here often they break covert at our feet.'

     And while they listened for the distant hunt,
  And chiefly for the baying of Cavall,
  King Arthur's hound of deepest mouth, there rode
  Full slowly by a knight, lady, and dwarf;
  Whereof the dwarf lagged latest, and the knight
  Had vizor up, and showed a youthful face,
  Imperious, and of haughtiest lineaments.
  And Guinevere, not mindful of his face
  In the King's hall, desired his name, and sent
  Her maiden to demand it of the dwarf;
  Who being vicious, old and irritable,
  And doubling all his master's vice of pride,
  Made answer sharply that she should not know.
  'Then will I ask it of himself,' she said.
  'Nay, by my faith, thou shalt not,' cried the dwarf;
  'Thou art not worthy even to speak of him;'
  And when she put her horse toward the knight,
  Struck at her with his whip, and she returned
  Indignant to the Queen; whereat Geraint
  Exclaiming, 'Surely I will learn the name,'
  Made sharply to the dwarf, and asked it of him,
  Who answered as before; and when the Prince
  Had put his horse in motion toward the knight,
  Struck at him with his whip, and cut his cheek.
  The Prince's blood spirted upon the scarf,
  Dyeing it; and his quick, instinctive hand
  Caught at the hilt, as to abolish him:
  But he, from his exceeding manfulness
  And pure nobility of temperament,
  Wroth to be wroth at such a worm, refrained
  From even a word, and so returning said:

     'I will avenge this insult, noble Queen,
  Done in your maiden's person to yourself:
  And I will track this vermin to their earths:
  For though I ride unarmed, I do not doubt
  To find, at some place I shall come at, arms
  On loan, or else for pledge; and, being found,
  Then will I fight him, and will break his pride,
  And on the third day will again be here,
  So that I be not fallen in fight.  Farewell.'

     'Farewell, fair Prince,' answered the stately Queen.
  'Be prosperous in this journey, as in all;
  And may you light on all things that you love,
  And live to wed with her whom first you love:
  But ere you wed with any, bring your bride,
  And I, were she the daughter of a king,
  Yea, though she were a beggar from the hedge,
  Will clothe her for her bridals like the sun.'

     And Prince Geraint, now thinking that he heard
  The noble hart at bay, now the far horn,
  A little vext at losing of the hunt,
  A little at the vile occasion, rode,
  By ups and downs, through many a grassy glade
  And valley, with fixt eye following the three.
  At last they issued from the world of wood,
  And climbed upon a fair and even ridge,
  And showed themselves against the sky, and sank.
  And thither there came Geraint, and underneath
  Beheld the long street of a little town
  In a long valley, on one side whereof,
  White from the mason's hand, a fortress rose;
  And on one side a castle in decay,
  Beyond a bridge that spanned a dry ravine:
  And out of town and valley came a noise
  As of a broad brook o'er a shingly bed
  Brawling, or like a clamour of the rooks
  At distance, ere they settle for the night.

     And onward to the fortress rode the three,
  And entered, and were lost behind the walls.
  'So,' thought Geraint, 'I have tracked him to his earth.'
  And down the long street riding wearily,
  Found every hostel full, and everywhere
  Was hammer laid to hoof, and the hot hiss
  And bustling whistle of the youth who scoured
  His master's armour; and of such a one
  He asked, 'What means the tumult in the town?'
  Who told him, scouring still, 'The sparrow-hawk!'
  Then riding close behind an ancient churl,
  Who, smitten by the dusty sloping beam,
  Went sweating underneath a sack of corn,
  Asked yet once more what meant the hubbub here?
  Who answered gruffly, 'Ugh! the sparrow-hawk.'
  Then riding further past an armourer's,
  Who, with back turned, and bowed above his work,
  Sat riveting a helmet on his knee,
  He put the self-same query, but the man
  Not turning round, nor looking at him, said:
  'Friend, he that labours for the sparrow-hawk
  Has little time for idle questioners.'
  Whereat Geraint flashed into sudden spleen:
  'A thousand pips eat up your sparrow-hawk!
  Tits, wrens, and all winged nothings peck him dead!
  Ye think the rustic cackle of your bourg
  The murmur of the world!  What is it to me?
  O wretched set of sparrows, one and all,
  Who pipe of nothing but of sparrow-hawks!
  Speak, if ye be not like the rest, hawk-mad,
  Where can I get me harbourage for the night?
  And arms, arms, arms to fight my enemy?  Speak!'
  Whereat the armourer turning all amazed
  And seeing one so gay in purple silks,
  Came forward with the helmet yet in hand
  And answered, 'Pardon me, O stranger knight;
  We hold a tourney here tomorrow morn,
  And there is scantly time for half the work.
  Arms? truth! I know not:  all are wanted here.
  Harbourage? truth, good truth, I know not, save,
  It may be, at Earl Yniol's, o'er the bridge
  Yonder.'  He spoke and fell to work again.

     Then rode Geraint, a little spleenful yet,
  Across the bridge that spanned the dry ravine.
  There musing sat the hoary-headed Earl,
  (His dress a suit of frayed magnificence,
  Once fit for feasts of ceremony) and said:
  'Whither, fair son?' to whom Geraint replied,
  'O friend, I seek a harbourage for the night.'
  Then Yniol, 'Enter therefore and partake
  The slender entertainment of a house
  Once rich, now poor, but ever open-doored.'
  'Thanks, venerable friend,' replied Geraint;
  'So that ye do not serve me sparrow-hawks
  For supper, I will enter, I will eat
  With all the passion of a twelve hours' fast.'
  Then sighed and smiled the hoary-headed Earl,
  And answered, 'Graver cause than yours is mine
  To curse this hedgerow thief, the sparrow-hawk:
  But in, go in; for save yourself desire it,
  We will not touch upon him even in jest.'

     Then rode Geraint into the castle court,
  His charger trampling many a prickly star
  Of sprouted thistle on the broken stones.
  He looked and saw that all was ruinous.
  Here stood a shattered archway plumed with fern;
  And here had fallen a great part of a tower,
  Whole, like a crag that tumbles from the cliff,
  And like a crag was gay with wilding flowers:
  And high above a piece of turret stair,
  Worn by the feet that now were silent, wound
  Bare to the sun, and monstrous ivy-stems
  Claspt the gray walls with hairy-fibred arms,
  And sucked the joining of the stones, and looked
  A knot, beneath, of snakes, aloft, a grove.

     And while he waited in the castle court,
  The voice of Enid, Yniol's daughter, rang
  Clear through the open casement of the hall,
  Singing; and as the sweet voice of a bird,
  Heard by the lander in a lonely isle,
  Moves him to think what kind of bird it is
  That sings so delicately clear, and make
  Conjecture of the plumage and the form;
  So the sweet voice of Enid moved Geraint;
  And made him like a man abroad at morn
  When first the liquid note beloved of men
  Comes flying over many a windy wave
  To Britain, and in April suddenly
  Breaks from a coppice gemmed with green and red,
  And he suspends his converse with a friend,
  Or it may be the labour of his hands,
  To think or say, 'There is the nightingale;'
  So fared it with Geraint, who thought and said,
  'Here, by God's grace, is the one voice for me.'

     It chanced the song that Enid sang was one
  Of Fortune and her wheel, and Enid sang:

     'Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel and lower the proud;
  Turn thy wild wheel through sunshine, storm, and cloud;
  Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.

     'Turn, Fortune, turn thy wheel with smile or frown;
  With that wild wheel we go not up or down;
  Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.

     'Smile and we smile, the lords of many lands;
  Frown and we smile, the lords of our own hands;
  For man is man and master of his fate.

     'Turn, turn thy wheel above the staring crowd;
  Thy wheel and thou are shadows in the cloud;
  Thy wheel and thee we neither love nor hate.'

     'Hark, by the bird's song ye may learn the nest,'
  Said Yniol; 'enter quickly.'  Entering then,
  Right o'er a mount of newly-fallen stones,
  The dusky-raftered many-cobwebbed hall,
  He found an ancient dame in dim brocade;
  And near her, like a blossom vermeil-white,
  That lightly breaks a faded flower-sheath,
  Moved the fair Enid, all in faded silk,
  Her daughter.  In a moment thought Geraint,
  'Here by God's rood is the one maid for me.'
  But none spake word except the hoary Earl:
  'Enid, the good knight's horse stands in the court;
  Take him to stall, and give him corn, and then
  Go to the town and buy us flesh and wine;
  And we will make us merry as we may.
  Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great.'

     He spake:  the Prince, as Enid past him, fain
  To follow, strode a stride, but Yniol caught
  His purple scarf, and held, and said, 'Forbear!
  Rest! the good house, though ruined, O my son,
  Endures not that her guest should serve himself.'
  And reverencing the custom of the house
  Geraint, from utter courtesy, forbore.

     So Enid took his charger to the stall;
  And after went her way across the bridge,
  And reached the town, and while the Prince and Earl
  Yet spoke together, came again with one,
  A youth, that following with a costrel bore
  The means of goodly welcome, flesh and wine.
  And Enid brought sweet cakes to make them cheer,
  And in her veil enfolded, manchet bread.
  And then, because their hall must also serve
  For kitchen, boiled the flesh, and spread the board,
  And stood behind, and waited on the three.
  And seeing her so sweet and serviceable,
  Geraint had longing in him evermore
  To stoop and kiss the tender little thumb,
  That crost the trencher as she laid it down:
  But after all had eaten, then Geraint,
  For now the wine made summer in his veins,
  Let his eye rove in following, or rest
  On Enid at her lowly handmaid-work,
  Now here, now there, about the dusky hall;
  Then suddenly addrest the hoary Earl:

     'Fair Host and Earl, I pray your courtesy;
  This sparrow-hawk, what is he? tell me of him.
  His name? but no, good faith, I will not have it:
  For if he be the knight whom late I saw
  Ride into that new fortress by your town,
  White from the mason's hand, then have I sworn
  From his own lips to have it--I am Geraint
  Of Devon--for this morning when the Queen
  Sent her own maiden to demand the name,
  His dwarf, a vicious under-shapen thing,
  Struck at her with his whip, and she returned
  Indignant to the Queen; and then I swore
  That I would track this caitiff to his hold,
  And fight and break his pride, and have it of him.
  And all unarmed I rode, and thought to find
  Arms in your town, where all the men are mad;
  They take the rustic murmur of their bourg
  For the great wave that echoes round the world;
  They would not hear me speak:  but if ye know
  Where I can light on arms, or if yourself
  Should have them, tell me, seeing I have sworn
  That I will break his pride and learn his name,
  Avenging this great insult done the Queen.'

     Then cried Earl Yniol, 'Art thou he indeed,
  Geraint, a name far-sounded among men
  For noble deeds? and truly I, when first
  I saw you moving by me on the bridge,
  Felt ye were somewhat, yea, and by your state
  And presence might have guessed you one of those
  That eat in Arthur's hall in Camelot.
  Nor speak I now from foolish flattery;
  For this dear child hath often heard me praise
  Your feats of arms, and often when I paused
  Hath asked again, and ever loved to hear;
  So grateful is the noise of noble deeds
  To noble hearts who see but acts of wrong:
  O never yet had woman such a pair
  Of suitors as this maiden:  first Limours,
  A creature wholly given to brawls and wine,
  Drunk even when he wooed; and be he dead
  I know not, but he past to the wild land.
  The second was your foe, the sparrow-hawk,
  My curse, my nephew--I will not let his name
  Slip from my lips if I can help it--he,
  When that I knew him fierce and turbulent
  Refused her to him, then his pride awoke;
  And since the proud man often is the mean,
  He sowed a slander in the common ear,
  Affirming that his father left him gold,
  And in my charge, which was not rendered to him;
  Bribed with large promises the men who served
  About my person, the more easily
  Because my means were somewhat broken into
  Through open doors and hospitality;
  Raised my own town against me in the night
  Before my Enid's birthday, sacked my house;
  From mine own earldom foully ousted me;
  Built that new fort to overawe my friends,
  For truly there are those who love me yet;
  And keeps me in this ruinous castle here,
  Where doubtless he would put me soon to death,
  But that his pride too much despises me:
  And I myself sometimes despise myself;
  For I have let men be, and have their way;
  Am much too gentle, have not used my power:
  Nor know I whether I be very base
  Or very manful, whether very wise
  Or very foolish; only this I know,
  That whatsoever evil happen to me,
  I seem to suffer nothing heart or limb,
  But can endure it all most patiently.'

     'Well said, true heart,' replied Geraint, 'but arms,
  That if the sparrow-hawk, this nephew, fight
  In next day's tourney I may break his pride.'

     And Yniol answered, 'Arms, indeed, but old
  And rusty, old and rusty, Prince Geraint,
  Are mine, and therefore at thy asking, thine.
  But in this tournament can no man tilt,
  Except the lady he loves best be there.
  Two forks are fixt into the meadow ground,
  And over these is placed a silver wand,
  And over that a golden sparrow-hawk,
  The prize of beauty for the fairest there.
  And this, what knight soever be in field
  Lays claim to for the lady at his side,
  And tilts with my good nephew thereupon,
  Who being apt at arms and big of bone
  Has ever won it for the lady with him,
  And toppling over all antagonism
  Has earned himself the name of sparrow-hawk.'
  But thou, that hast no lady, canst not fight.'

     To whom Geraint with eyes all bright replied,
  Leaning a little toward him, 'Thy leave!
  Let me lay lance in rest, O noble host,
  For this dear child, because I never saw,
  Though having seen all beauties of our time,
  Nor can see elsewhere, anything so fair.
  And if I fall her name will yet remain
  Untarnished as before; but if I live,
  So aid me Heaven when at mine uttermost,
  As I will make her truly my true wife.'

     Then, howsoever patient, Yniol's heart
  Danced in his bosom, seeing better days,
  And looking round he saw not Enid there,
  (Who hearing her own name had stolen away)
  But that old dame, to whom full tenderly
  And folding all her hand in his he said,
  'Mother, a maiden is a tender thing,
  And best by her that bore her understood.
  Go thou to rest, but ere thou go to rest
  Tell her, and prove her heart toward the Prince.'

     So spake the kindly-hearted Earl, and she
  With frequent smile and nod departing found,
  Half disarrayed as to her rest, the girl;
  Whom first she kissed on either cheek, and then
  On either shining shoulder laid a hand,
  And kept her off and gazed upon her face,
  And told them all their converse in the hall,
  Proving her heart:  but never light and shade
  Coursed one another more on open ground
  Beneath a troubled heaven, than red and pale
  Across the face of Enid hearing her;
  While slowly falling as a scale that falls,
  When weight is added only grain by grain,
  Sank her sweet head upon her gentle breast;
  Nor did she lift an eye nor speak a word,
  Rapt in the fear and in the wonder of it;
  So moving without answer to her rest
  She found no rest, and ever failed to draw
  The quiet night into her blood, but lay
  Contemplating her own unworthiness;
  And when the pale and bloodless east began
  To quicken to the sun, arose, and raised
  Her mother too, and hand in hand they moved
  Down to the meadow where the jousts were held,
  And waited there for Yniol and Geraint.

     And thither came the twain, and when Geraint
  Beheld her first in field, awaiting him,
  He felt, were she the prize of bodily force,
  Himself beyond the rest pushing could move
  The chair of Idris.  Yniol's rusted arms
  Were on his princely person, but through these
  Princelike his bearing shone; and errant knights
  And ladies came, and by and by the town
  Flowed in, and settling circled all the lists.
  And there they fixt the forks into the ground,
  And over these they placed the silver wand,
  And over that the golden sparrow-hawk.
  Then Yniol's nephew, after trumpet blown,
  Spake to the lady with him and proclaimed,
  'Advance and take, as fairest of the fair,
  What I these two years past have won for thee,
  The prize of beauty.'  Loudly spake the Prince,
  'Forbear:  there is a worthier,' and the knight
  With some surprise and thrice as much disdain
  Turned, and beheld the four, and all his face
  Glowed like the heart of a great fire at Yule,
  So burnt he was with passion, crying out,
  'Do battle for it then,' no more; and thrice
  They clashed together, and thrice they brake their spears.
  Then each, dishorsed and drawing, lashed at each
  So often and with such blows, that all the crowd
  Wondered, and now and then from distant walls
  There came a clapping as of phantom hands.
  So twice they fought, and twice they breathed, and still
  The dew of their great labour, and the blood
  Of their strong bodies, flowing, drained their force.
  But either's force was matched till Yniol's cry,
  'Remember that great insult done the Queen,'
  Increased Geraint's, who heaved his blade aloft,
  And cracked the helmet through, and bit the bone,
  And felled him, and set foot upon his breast,
  And said, 'Thy name?'  To whom the fallen man
  Made answer, groaning, 'Edyrn, son of Nudd!
  Ashamed am I that I should tell it thee.
  My pride is broken:  men have seen my fall.'
  'Then, Edyrn, son of Nudd,' replied Geraint,
  'These two things shalt thou do, or else thou diest.
  First, thou thyself, with damsel and with dwarf,
  Shalt ride to Arthur's court, and coming there,
  Crave pardon for that insult done the Queen,
  And shalt abide her judgment on it; next,
  Thou shalt give back their earldom to thy kin.
  These two things shalt thou do, or thou shalt die.'
  And Edyrn answered, 'These things will I do,
  For I have never yet been overthrown,
  And thou hast overthrown me, and my pride
  Is broken down, for Enid sees my fall!'
  And rising up, he rode to Arthur's court,
  And there the Queen forgave him easily.
  And being young, he changed and came to loathe
  His crime of traitor, slowly drew himself
  Bright from his old dark life, and fell at last
  In the great battle fighting for the King.

     But when the third day from the hunting-morn
  Made a low splendour in the world, and wings
  Moved in her ivy, Enid, for she lay
  With her fair head in the dim-yellow light,
  Among the dancing shadows of the birds,
  Woke and bethought her of her promise given
  No later than last eve to Prince Geraint--
  So bent he seemed on going the third day,
  He would not leave her, till her promise given--
  To ride with him this morning to the court,
  And there be made known to the stately Queen,
  And there be wedded with all ceremony.
  At this she cast her eyes upon her dress,
  And thought it never yet had looked so mean.
  For as a leaf in mid-November is
  To what it is in mid-October, seemed
  The dress that now she looked on to the dress
  She looked on ere the coming of Geraint.
  And still she looked, and still the terror grew
  Of that strange bright and dreadful thing, a court,
  All staring at her in her faded silk:
  And softly to her own sweet heart she said:

     'This noble prince who won our earldom back,
  So splendid in his acts and his attire,
  Sweet heaven, how much I shall discredit him!
  Would he could tarry with us here awhile,
  But being so beholden to the Prince,
  It were but little grace in any of us,
  Bent as he seemed on going this third day,
  To seek a second favour at his hands.
  Yet if he could but tarry a day or two,
  Myself would work eye dim, and finger lame,
  Far liefer than so much discredit him.'

     And Enid fell in longing for a dress
  All branched and flowered with gold, a costly gift
  Of her good mother, given her on the night
  Before her birthday, three sad years ago,
  That night of fire, when Edyrn sacked their house,
  And scattered all they had to all the winds:
  For while the mother showed it, and the two
  Were turning and admiring it, the work
  To both appeared so costly, rose a cry
  That Edyrn's men were on them, and they fled
  With little save the jewels they had on,
  Which being sold and sold had bought them bread:
  And Edyrn's men had caught them in their flight,
  And placed them in this ruin; and she wished
  The Prince had found her in her ancient home;
  Then let her fancy flit across the past,
  And roam the goodly places that she knew;
  And last bethought her how she used to watch,
  Near that old home, a pool of golden carp;
  And one was patched and blurred and lustreless
  Among his burnished brethren of the pool;
  And half asleep she made comparison
  Of that and these to her own faded self
  And the gay court, and fell asleep again;
  And dreamt herself was such a faded form
  Among her burnished sisters of the pool;
  But this was in the garden of a king;
  And though she lay dark in the pool, she knew
  That all was bright; that all about were birds
  Of sunny plume in gilded trellis-work;
  That all the turf was rich in plots that looked
  Each like a garnet or a turkis in it;
  And lords and ladies of the high court went
  In silver tissue talking things of state;
  And children of the King in cloth of gold
  Glanced at the doors or gamboled down the walks;
  And while she thought 'They will not see me,' came
  A stately queen whose name was Guinevere,
  And all the children in their cloth of gold
  Ran to her, crying, 'If we have fish at all
  Let them be gold; and charge the gardeners now
  To pick the faded creature from the pool,
  And cast it on the mixen that it die.'
  And therewithal one came and seized on her,
  And Enid started waking, with her heart
  All overshadowed by the foolish dream,
  And lo! it was her mother grasping her
  To get her well awake; and in her hand
  A suit of bright apparel, which she laid
  Flat on the couch, and spoke exultingly:

     'See here, my child, how fresh the colours look,
  How fast they hold like colours of a shell
  That keeps the wear and polish of the wave.
  Why not?  It never yet was worn, I trow:
  Look on it, child, and tell me if ye know it.'

     And Enid looked, but all confused at first,
  Could scarce divide it from her foolish dream:
  Then suddenly she knew it and rejoiced,
  And answered, 'Yea, I know it; your good gift,
  So sadly lost on that unhappy night;
  Your own good gift!'  'Yea, surely,' said the dame,
  'And gladly given again this happy morn.
  For when the jousts were ended yesterday,
  Went Yniol through the town, and everywhere
  He found the sack and plunder of our house
  All scattered through the houses of the town;
  And gave command that all which once was ours
  Should now be ours again:  and yester-eve,
  While ye were talking sweetly with your Prince,
  Came one with this and laid it in my hand,
  For love or fear, or seeking favour of us,
  Because we have our earldom back again.
  And yester-eve I would not tell you of it,
  But kept it for a sweet surprise at morn.
  Yea, truly is it not a sweet surprise?
  For I myself unwillingly have worn
  My faded suit, as you, my child, have yours,
  And howsoever patient, Yniol his.
  Ah, dear, he took me from a goodly house,
  With store of rich apparel, sumptuous fare,
  And page, and maid, and squire, and seneschal,
  And pastime both of hawk and hound, and all
  That appertains to noble maintenance.
  Yea, and he brought me to a goodly house;
  But since our fortune swerved from sun to shade,
  And all through that young traitor, cruel need
  Constrained us, but a better time has come;
  So clothe yourself in this, that better fits
  Our mended fortunes and a Prince's bride:
  For though ye won the prize of fairest fair,
  And though I heard him call you fairest fair,
  Let never maiden think, however fair,
  She is not fairer in new clothes than old.
  And should some great court-lady say, the Prince
  Hath picked a ragged-robin from the hedge,
  And like a madman brought her to the court,
  Then were ye shamed, and, worse, might shame the Prince
  To whom we are beholden; but I know,
  That when my dear child is set forth at her best,
  That neither court nor country, though they sought
  Through all the provinces like those of old
  That lighted on Queen Esther, has her match.'

     Here ceased the kindly mother out of breath;
  And Enid listened brightening as she lay;
  Then, as the white and glittering star of morn
  Parts from a bank of snow, and by and by
  Slips into golden cloud, the maiden rose,
  And left her maiden couch, and robed herself,
  Helped by the mother's careful hand and eye,
  Without a mirror, in the gorgeous gown;
  Who, after, turned her daughter round, and said,
  She never yet had seen her half so fair;
  And called her like that maiden in the tale,
  Whom Gwydion made by glamour out of flowers
  And sweeter than the bride of Cassivelaun,
  Flur, for whose love the Roman Caesar first
  Invaded Britain, 'But we beat him back,
  As this great Prince invaded us, and we,
  Not beat him back, but welcomed him with joy
  And I can scarcely ride with you to court,
  For old am I, and rough the ways and wild;
  But Yniol goes, and I full oft shall dream
  I see my princess as I see her now,
  Clothed with my gift, and gay among the gay.'

     But while the women thus rejoiced, Geraint
  Woke where he slept in the high hall, and called
  For Enid, and when Yniol made report
  Of that good mother making Enid gay
  In such apparel as might well beseem
  His princess, or indeed the stately Queen,
  He answered:  'Earl, entreat her by my love,
  Albeit I give no reason but my wish,
  That she ride with me in her faded silk.'
  Yniol with that hard message went; it fell
  Like flaws in summer laying lusty corn:
  For Enid, all abashed she knew not why,
  Dared not to glance at her good mother's face,
  But silently, in all obedience,
  Her mother silent too, nor helping her,
  Laid from her limbs the costly-broidered gift,
  And robed them in her ancient suit again,
  And so descended.  Never man rejoiced
  More than Geraint to greet her thus attired;
  And glancing all at once as keenly at her
  As careful robins eye the delver's toil,
  Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall,
  But rested with her sweet face satisfied;
  Then seeing cloud upon the mother's brow,
  Her by both hands she caught, and sweetly said,

     'O my new mother, be not wroth or grieved
  At thy new son, for my petition to her.
  When late I left Caerleon, our great Queen,
  In words whose echo lasts, they were so sweet,
  Made promise, that whatever bride I brought,
  Herself would clothe her like the sun in Heaven.
  Thereafter, when I reached this ruined hall,
  Beholding one so bright in dark estate,
  I vowed that could I gain her, our fair Queen,
  No hand but hers, should make your Enid burst
  Sunlike from cloud--and likewise thought perhaps,
  That service done so graciously would bind
  The two together; fain I would the two
  Should love each other:  how can Enid find
  A nobler friend?  Another thought was mine;
  I came among you here so suddenly,
  That though her gentle presence at the lists
  Might well have served for proof that I was loved,
  I doubted whether daughter's tenderness,
  Or easy nature, might not let itself
  Be moulded by your wishes for her weal;
  Or whether some false sense in her own self
  Of my contrasting brightness, overbore
  Her fancy dwelling in this dusky hall;
  And such a sense might make her long for court
  And all its perilous glories:  and I thought,
  That could I someway prove such force in her
  Linked with such love for me, that at a word
  (No reason given her) she could cast aside
  A splendour dear to women, new to her,
  And therefore dearer; or if not so new,
  Yet therefore tenfold dearer by the power
  Of intermitted usage; then I felt
  That I could rest, a rock in ebbs and flows,
  Fixt on her faith.  Now, therefore, I do rest,
  A prophet certain of my prophecy,
  That never shadow of mistrust can cross
  Between us.  Grant me pardon for my thoughts:
  And for my strange petition I will make
  Amends hereafter by some gaudy-day,
  When your fair child shall wear your costly gift
  Beside your own warm hearth, with, on her knees,
  Who knows? another gift of the high God,
  Which, maybe, shall have learned to lisp you thanks.'

     He spoke:  the mother smiled, but half in tears,
  Then brought a mantle down and wrapt her in it,
  And claspt and kissed her, and they rode away.

     Now thrice that morning Guinevere had climbed
  The giant tower, from whose high crest, they say,
  Men saw the goodly hills of Somerset,
  And white sails flying on the yellow sea;
  But not to goodly hill or yellow sea
  Looked the fair Queen, but up the vale of Usk,
  By the flat meadow, till she saw them come;
  And then descending met them at the gates,
  Embraced her with all welcome as a friend,
  And did her honour as the Prince's bride,
  And clothed her for her bridals like the sun;
  And all that week was old Caerleon gay,
  For by the hands of Dubric, the high saint,
  They twain were wedded with all ceremony.

     And this was on the last year's Whitsuntide.
  But Enid ever kept the faded silk,
  Remembering how first he came on her,
  Drest in that dress, and how he loved her in it,
  And all her foolish fears about the dress,
  And all his journey toward her, as himself
  Had told her, and their coming to the court.

     And now this morning when he said to her,
  'Put on your worst and meanest dress,' she found
  And took it, and arrayed herself therein.



  Geraint and Enid

  O purblind race of miserable men,
  How many among us at this very hour
  Do forge a life-long trouble for ourselves,
  By taking true for false, or false for true;
  Here, through the feeble twilight of this world
  Groping, how many, until we pass and reach
  That other, where we see as we are seen!

     So fared it with Geraint, who issuing forth
  That morning, when they both had got to horse,
  Perhaps because he loved her passionately,
  And felt that tempest brooding round his heart,
  Which, if he spoke at all, would break perforce
  Upon a head so dear in thunder, said:
  'Not at my side.  I charge thee ride before,
  Ever a good way on before; and this
  I charge thee, on thy duty as a wife,
  Whatever happens, not to speak to me,
  No, not a word!' and Enid was aghast;
  And forth they rode, but scarce three paces on,
  When crying out, 'Effeminate as I am,
  I will not fight my way with gilded arms,
  All shall be iron;' he loosed a mighty purse,
  Hung at his belt, and hurled it toward the squire.
  So the last sight that Enid had of home
  Was all the marble threshold flashing, strown
  With gold and scattered coinage, and the squire
  Chafing his shoulder:  then he cried again,
  'To the wilds!' and Enid leading down the tracks
  Through which he bad her lead him on, they past
  The marches, and by bandit-haunted holds,
  Gray swamps and pools, waste places of the hern,
  And wildernesses, perilous paths, they rode:
  Round was their pace at first, but slackened soon:
  A stranger meeting them had surely thought
  They rode so slowly and they looked so pale,
  That each had suffered some exceeding wrong.
  For he was ever saying to himself,
  'O I that wasted time to tend upon her,
  To compass her with sweet observances,
  To dress her beautifully and keep her true'--
  And there he broke the sentence in his heart
  Abruptly, as a man upon his tongue
  May break it, when his passion masters him.
  And she was ever praying the sweet heavens
  To save her dear lord whole from any wound.
  And ever in her mind she cast about
  For that unnoticed failing in herself,
  Which made him look so cloudy and so cold;
  Till the great plover's human whistle amazed
  Her heart, and glancing round the waste she feared
  In ever wavering brake an ambuscade.
  Then thought again, 'If there be such in me,
  I might amend it by the grace of Heaven,
  If he would only speak and tell me of it.'

     But when the fourth part of the day was gone,
  Then Enid was aware of three tall knights
  On horseback, wholly armed, behind a rock
  In shadow, waiting for them, caitiffs all;
  And heard one crying to his fellow, 'Look,
  Here comes a laggard hanging down his head,
  Who seems no bolder than a beaten hound;
  Come, we will slay him and will have his horse
  And armour, and his damsel shall be ours.'

     Then Enid pondered in her heart, and said:
  'I will go back a little to my lord,
  And I will tell him all their caitiff talk;
  For, be he wroth even to slaying me,
  Far liefer by his dear hand had I die,
  Than that my lord should suffer loss or shame.'

     Then she went back some paces of return,
  Met his full frown timidly firm, and said;
  'My lord, I saw three bandits by the rock
  Waiting to fall on you, and heard them boast
  That they would slay you, and possess your horse
  And armour, and your damsel should be theirs.'

     He made a wrathful answer:  'Did I wish
  Your warning or your silence? one command
  I laid upon you, not to speak to me,
  And thus ye keep it!  Well then, look--for now,
  Whether ye wish me victory or defeat,
  Long for my life, or hunger for my death,
  Yourself shall see my vigour is not lost.'

     Then Enid waited pale and sorrowful,
  And down upon him bare the bandit three.
  And at the midmost charging, Prince Geraint
  Drave the long spear a cubit through his breast
  And out beyond; and then against his brace
  Of comrades, each of whom had broken on him
  A lance that splintered like an icicle,
  Swung from his brand a windy buffet out
  Once, twice, to right, to left, and stunned the twain
  Or slew them, and dismounting like a man
  That skins the wild beast after slaying him,
  Stript from the three dead wolves of woman born
  The three gay suits of armour which they wore,
  And let the bodies lie, but bound the suits
  Of armour on their horses, each on each,
  And tied the bridle-reins of all the three
  Together, and said to her, 'Drive them on
  Before you;' and she drove them through the waste.

     He followed nearer; ruth began to work
  Against his anger in him, while he watched
  The being he loved best in all the world,
  With difficulty in mild obedience
  Driving them on:  he fain had spoken to her,
  And loosed in words of sudden fire the wrath
  And smouldered wrong that burnt him all within;
  But evermore it seemed an easier thing
  At once without remorse to strike her dead,
  Than to cry 'Halt,' and to her own bright face
  Accuse her of the least immodesty:
  And thus tongue-tied, it made him wroth the more
  That she could speak whom his own ear had heard
  Call herself false:  and suffering thus he made
  Minutes an age:  but in scarce longer time
  Than at Caerleon the full-tided Usk,
  Before he turn to fall seaward again,
  Pauses, did Enid, keeping watch, behold
  In the first shallow shade of a deep wood,
  Before a gloom of stubborn-shafted oaks,
  Three other horsemen waiting, wholly armed,
  Whereof one seemed far larger than her lord,
  And shook her pulses, crying, 'Look, a prize!
  Three horses and three goodly suits of arms,
  And all in charge of whom? a girl:  set on.'
  'Nay,' said the second, 'yonder comes a knight.'
  The third, 'A craven; how he hangs his head.'
  The giant answered merrily, 'Yea, but one?
  Wait here, and when he passes fall upon him.'

     And Enid pondered in her heart and said,
  'I will abide the coming of my lord,
  And I will tell him all their villainy.
  My lord is weary with the fight before,
  And they will fall upon him unawares.
  I needs must disobey him for his good;
  How should I dare obey him to his harm?
  Needs must I speak, and though he kill me for it,
  I save a life dearer to me than mine.'

     And she abode his coming, and said to him
  With timid firmness, 'Have I leave to speak?'
  He said, 'Ye take it, speaking,' and she spoke.

     'There lurk three villains yonder in the wood,
  And each of them is wholly armed, and one
  Is larger-limbed than you are, and they say
  That they will fall upon you while ye pass.'

     To which he flung a wrathful answer back:
  'And if there were an hundred in the wood,
  And every man were larger-limbed than I,
  And all at once should sally out upon me,
  I swear it would not ruffle me so much
  As you that not obey me.  Stand aside,
  And if I fall, cleave to the better man.'

     And Enid stood aside to wait the event,
  Not dare to watch the combat, only breathe
  Short fits of prayer, at every stroke a breath.
  And he, she dreaded most, bare down upon him.
  Aimed at the helm, his lance erred; but Geraint's,
  A little in the late encounter strained,
  Struck through the bulky bandit's corselet home,
  And then brake short, and down his enemy rolled,
  And there lay still; as he that tells the tale
  Saw once a great piece of a promontory,
  That had a sapling growing on it, slide
  From the long shore-cliff's windy walls to the beach,
  And there lie still, and yet the sapling grew:
  So lay the man transfixt.  His craven pair
  Of comrades making slowlier at the Prince,
  When now they saw their bulwark fallen, stood;
  On whom the victor, to confound them more,
  Spurred with his terrible war-cry; for as one,
  That listens near a torrent mountain-brook,
  All through the crash of the near cataract hears
  The drumming thunder of the huger fall
  At distance, were the soldiers wont to hear
  His voice in battle, and be kindled by it,
  And foemen scared, like that false pair who turned
  Flying, but, overtaken, died the death
  Themselves had wrought on many an innocent.

     Thereon Geraint, dismounting, picked the lance
  That pleased him best, and drew from those dead wolves
  Their three gay suits of armour, each from each,
  And bound them on their horses, each on each,
  And tied the bridle-reins of all the three
  Together, and said to her, 'Drive them on
  Before you,' and she drove them through the wood.

     He followed nearer still:  the pain she had
  To keep them in the wild ways of the wood,
  Two sets of three laden with jingling arms,
  Together, served a little to disedge
  The sharpness of that pain about her heart:
  And they themselves, like creatures gently born
  But into bad hands fallen, and now so long
  By bandits groomed, pricked their light ears, and felt
  Her low firm voice and tender government.

     So through the green gloom of the wood they past,
  And issuing under open heavens beheld
  A little town with towers, upon a rock,
  And close beneath, a meadow gemlike chased
  In the brown wild, and mowers mowing in it:
  And down a rocky pathway from the place
  There came a fair-haired youth, that in his hand
  Bare victual for the mowers:  and Geraint
  Had ruth again on Enid looking pale:
  Then, moving downward to the meadow ground,
  He, when the fair-haired youth came by him, said,
  'Friend, let her eat; the damsel is so faint.'
  'Yea, willingly,' replied the youth; 'and thou,
  My lord, eat also, though the fare is coarse,
  And only meet for mowers;' then set down
  His basket, and dismounting on the sward
  They let the horses graze, and ate themselves.
  And Enid took a little delicately,
  Less having stomach for it than desire
  To close with her lord's pleasure; but Geraint
  Ate all the mowers' victual unawares,
  And when he found all empty, was amazed;
  And 'Boy,' said he, 'I have eaten all, but take
  A horse and arms for guerdon; choose the best.'
  He, reddening in extremity of delight,
  'My lord, you overpay me fifty-fold.'
  'Ye will be all the wealthier,' cried the Prince.
  'I take it as free gift, then,' said the boy,
  'Not guerdon; for myself can easily,
  While your good damsel rests, return, and fetch
  Fresh victual for these mowers of our Earl;
  For these are his, and all the field is his,
  And I myself am his; and I will tell him
  How great a man thou art:  he loves to know
  When men of mark are in his territory:
  And he will have thee to his palace here,
  And serve thee costlier than with mowers' fare.'

     Then said Geraint, 'I wish no better fare:
  I never ate with angrier appetite
  Than when I left your mowers dinnerless.
  And into no Earl's palace will I go.
  I know, God knows, too much of palaces!
  And if he want me, let him come to me.
  But hire us some fair chamber for the night,
  And stalling for the horses, and return
  With victual for these men, and let us know.'

     'Yea, my kind lord,' said the glad youth, and went,
  Held his head high, and thought himself a knight,
  And up the rocky pathway disappeared,
  Leading the horse, and they were left alone.

     But when the Prince had brought his errant eyes
  Home from the rock, sideways he let them glance
  At Enid, where she droopt:  his own false doom,
  That shadow of mistrust should never cross
  Betwixt them, came upon him, and he sighed;
  Then with another humorous ruth remarked
  The lusty mowers labouring dinnerless,
  And watched the sun blaze on the turning scythe,
  And after nodded sleepily in the heat.
  But she, remembering her old ruined hall,
  And all the windy clamour of the daws
  About her hollow turret, plucked the grass
  There growing longest by the meadow's edge,
  And into many a listless annulet,
  Now over, now beneath her marriage ring,
  Wove and unwove it, till the boy returned
  And told them of a chamber, and they went;
  Where, after saying to her, 'If ye will,
  Call for the woman of the house,' to which
  She answered, 'Thanks, my lord;' the two remained
  Apart by all the chamber's width, and mute
  As two creatures voiceless through the fault of birth,
  Or two wild men supporters of a shield,
  Painted, who stare at open space, nor glance
  The one at other, parted by the shield.

     On a sudden, many a voice along the street,
  And heel against the pavement echoing, burst
  Their drowse; and either started while the door,
  Pushed from without, drave backward to the wall,
  And midmost of a rout of roisterers,
  Femininely fair and dissolutely pale,
  Her suitor in old years before Geraint,
  Entered, the wild lord of the place, Limours.
  He moving up with pliant courtliness,
  Greeted Geraint full face, but stealthily,
  In the mid-warmth of welcome and graspt hand,
  Found Enid with the corner of his eye,
  And knew her sitting sad and solitary.
  Then cried Geraint for wine and goodly cheer
  To feed the sudden guest, and sumptuously
  According to his fashion, bad the host
  Call in what men soever were his friends,
  And feast with these in honour of their Earl;
  'And care not for the cost; the cost is mine.'

     And wine and food were brought, and Earl Limours
  Drank till he jested with all ease, and told
  Free tales, and took the word and played upon it,
  And made it of two colours; for his talk,
  When wine and free companions kindled him,
  Was wont to glance and sparkle like a gem
  Of fifty facets; thus he moved the Prince
  To laughter and his comrades to applause.
  Then, when the Prince was merry, asked Limours,
  'Your leave, my lord, to cross the room, and speak
  To your good damsel there who sits apart,
  And seems so lonely?'  'My free leave,' he said;
  'Get her to speak:  she doth not speak to me.'
  Then rose Limours, and looking at his feet,
  Like him who tries the bridge he fears may fail,
  Crost and came near, lifted adoring eyes,
  Bowed at her side and uttered whisperingly:

     'Enid, the pilot star of my lone life,
  Enid, my early and my only love,
  Enid, the loss of whom hath turned me wild--
  What chance is this? how is it I see you here?
  Ye are in my power at last, are in my power.
  Yet fear me not:  I call mine own self wild,
  But keep a touch of sweet civility
  Here in the heart of waste and wilderness.
  I thought, but that your father came between,
  In former days you saw me favourably.
  And if it were so do not keep it back:
  Make me a little happier:  let me know it:
  Owe you me nothing for a life half-lost?
  Yea, yea, the whole dear debt of all you are.
  And, Enid, you and he, I see with joy,
  Ye sit apart, you do not speak to him,
  You come with no attendance, page or maid,
  To serve you--doth he love you as of old?
  For, call it lovers' quarrels, yet I know
  Though men may bicker with the things they love,
  They would not make them laughable in all eyes,
  Not while they loved them; and your wretched dress,
  A wretched insult on you, dumbly speaks
  Your story, that this man loves you no more.
  Your beauty is no beauty to him now:
  A common chance--right well I know it--palled--
  For I know men:  nor will ye win him back,
  For the man's love once gone never returns.
  But here is one who loves you as of old;
  With more exceeding passion than of old:
  Good, speak the word:  my followers ring him round:
  He sits unarmed; I hold a finger up;
  They understand:  nay; I do not mean blood:
  Nor need ye look so scared at what I say:
  My malice is no deeper than a moat,
  No stronger than a wall:  there is the keep;
  He shall not cross us more; speak but the word:
  Or speak it not; but then by Him that made me
  The one true lover whom you ever owned,
  I will make use of all the power I have.
  O pardon me! the madness of that hour,
  When first I parted from thee, moves me yet.'

     At this the tender sound of his own voice
  And sweet self-pity, or the fancy of it,
  Made his eye moist; but Enid feared his eyes,
  Moist as they were, wine-heated from the feast;
  And answered with such craft as women use,
  Guilty or guiltless, to stave off a chance
  That breaks upon them perilously, and said:

     'Earl, if you love me as in former years,
  And do not practise on me, come with morn,
  And snatch me from him as by violence;
  Leave me tonight:  I am weary to the death.'

     Low at leave-taking, with his brandished plume
  Brushing his instep, bowed the all-amorous Earl,
  And the stout Prince bad him a loud good-night.
  He moving homeward babbled to his men,
  How Enid never loved a man but him,
  Nor cared a broken egg-shell for her lord.

     But Enid left alone with Prince Geraint,
  Debating his command of silence given,
  And that she now perforce must violate it,
  Held commune with herself, and while she held
  He fell asleep, and Enid had no heart
  To wake him, but hung o'er him, wholly pleased
  To find him yet unwounded after fight,
  And hear him breathing low and equally.
  Anon she rose, and stepping lightly, heaped
  The pieces of his armour in one place,
  All to be there against a sudden need;
  Then dozed awhile herself, but overtoiled
  By that day's grief and travel, evermore
  Seemed catching at a rootless thorn, and then
  Went slipping down horrible precipices,
  And strongly striking out her limbs awoke;
  Then thought she heard the wild Earl at the door,
  With all his rout of random followers,
  Sound on a dreadful trumpet, summoning her;
  Which was the red cock shouting to the light,
  As the gray dawn stole o'er the dewy world,
  And glimmered on his armour in the room.
  And once again she rose to look at it,
  But touched it unawares:  jangling, the casque
  Fell, and he started up and stared at her.
  Then breaking his command of silence given,
  She told him all that Earl Limours had said,
  Except the passage that he loved her not;
  Nor left untold the craft herself had used;
  But ended with apology so sweet,
  Low-spoken, and of so few words, and seemed
  So justified by that necessity,
  That though he thought 'was it for him she wept
  In Devon?' he but gave a wrathful groan,
  Saying, 'Your sweet faces make good fellows fools
  And traitors.  Call the host and bid him bring
  Charger and palfrey.'  So she glided out
  Among the heavy breathings of the house,
  And like a household Spirit at the walls
  Beat, till she woke the sleepers, and returned:
  Then tending her rough lord, though all unasked,
  In silence, did him service as a squire;
  Till issuing armed he found the host and cried,
  'Thy reckoning, friend?' and ere he learnt it, 'Take
  Five horses and their armours;' and the host
  Suddenly honest, answered in amaze,
  'My lord, I scarce have spent the worth of one!'
  'Ye will be all the wealthier,' said the Prince,
  And then to Enid, 'Forward! and today
  I charge you, Enid, more especially,
  What thing soever ye may hear, or see,
  Or fancy (though I count it of small use
  To charge you) that ye speak not but obey.'

     And Enid answered, 'Yea, my lord, I know
  Your wish, and would obey; but riding first,
  I hear the violent threats you do not hear,
  I see the danger which you cannot see:
  Then not to give you warning, that seems hard;
  Almost beyond me:  yet I would obey.'

     'Yea so,' said he, 'do it:  be not too wise;
  Seeing that ye are wedded to a man,
  Not all mismated with a yawning clown,
  But one with arms to guard his head and yours,
  With eyes to find you out however far,
  And ears to hear you even in his dreams.'

     With that he turned and looked as keenly at her
  As careful robins eye the delver's toil;
  And that within her, which a wanton fool,
  Or hasty judger would have called her guilt,
  Made her cheek burn and either eyelid fall.
  And Geraint looked and was not satisfied.

     Then forward by a way which, beaten broad,
  Led from the territory of false Limours
  To the waste earldom of another earl,
  Doorm, whom his shaking vassals called the Bull,
  Went Enid with her sullen follower on.
  Once she looked back, and when she saw him ride
  More near by many a rood than yestermorn,
  It wellnigh made her cheerful; till Geraint
  Waving an angry hand as who should say
  'Ye watch me,' saddened all her heart again.
  But while the sun yet beat a dewy blade,
  The sound of many a heavily-galloping hoof
  Smote on her ear, and turning round she saw
  Dust, and the points of lances bicker in it.
  Then not to disobey her lord's behest,
  And yet to give him warning, for he rode
  As if he heard not, moving back she held
  Her finger up, and pointed to the dust.
  At which the warrior in his obstinacy,
  Because she kept the letter of his word,
  Was in a manner pleased, and turning, stood.
  And in the moment after, wild Limours,
  Borne on a black horse, like a thunder-cloud
  Whose skirts are loosened by the breaking storm,
  Half ridden off with by the thing he rode,
  And all in passion uttering a dry shriek,
  Dashed down on Geraint, who closed with him, and bore
  Down by the length of lance and arm beyond
  The crupper, and so left him stunned or dead,
  And overthrew the next that followed him,
  And blindly rushed on all the rout behind.
  But at the flash and motion of the man
  They vanished panic-stricken, like a shoal
  Of darting fish, that on a summer morn
  Adown the crystal dykes at Camelot
  Come slipping o'er their shadows on the sand,
  But if a man who stands upon the brink
  But lift a shining hand against the sun,
  There is not left the twinkle of a fin
  Betwixt the cressy islets white in flower;
  So, scared but at the motion of the man,
  Fled all the boon companions of the Earl,
  And left him lying in the public way;
  So vanish friendships only made in wine.

     Then like a stormy sunlight smiled Geraint,
  Who saw the chargers of the two that fell
  Start from their fallen lords, and wildly fly,
  Mixt with the flyers.  'Horse and man,' he said,
  'All of one mind and all right-honest friends!
  Not a hoof left:  and I methinks till now
  Was honest--paid with horses and with arms;
  I cannot steal or plunder, no nor beg:
  And so what say ye, shall we strip him there
  Your lover? has your palfrey heart enough
  To bear his armour? shall we fast, or dine?
  No?--then do thou, being right honest, pray
  That we may meet the horsemen of Earl Doorm,
  I too would still be honest.'  Thus he said:
  And sadly gazing on her bridle-reins,
  And answering not one word, she led the way.

     But as a man to whom a dreadful loss
  Falls in a far land and he knows it not,
  But coming back he learns it, and the loss
  So pains him that he sickens nigh to death;
  So fared it with Geraint, who being pricked
  In combat with the follower of Limours,
  Bled underneath his armour secretly,
  And so rode on, nor told his gentle wife
  What ailed him, hardly knowing it himself,
  Till his eye darkened and his helmet wagged;
  And at a sudden swerving of the road,
  Though happily down on a bank of grass,
  The Prince, without a word, from his horse fell.

     And Enid heard the clashing of his fall,
  Suddenly came, and at his side all pale
  Dismounting, loosed the fastenings of his arms,
  Nor let her true hand falter, nor blue eye
  Moisten, till she had lighted on his wound,
  And tearing off her veil of faded silk
  Had bared her forehead to the blistering sun,
  And swathed the hurt that drained her dear lord's life.
  Then after all was done that hand could do,
  She rested, and her desolation came
  Upon her, and she wept beside the way.

     And many past, but none regarded her,
  For in that realm of lawless turbulence,
  A woman weeping for her murdered mate
  Was cared as much for as a summer shower:
  One took him for a victim of Earl Doorm,
  Nor dared to waste a perilous pity on him:
  Another hurrying past, a man-at-arms,
  Rode on a mission to the bandit Earl;
  Half whistling and half singing a coarse song,
  He drove the dust against her veilless eyes:
  Another, flying from the wrath of Doorm
  Before an ever-fancied arrow, made
  The long way smoke beneath him in his fear;
  At which her palfrey whinnying lifted heel,
  And scoured into the coppices and was lost,
  While the great charger stood, grieved like a man.

     But at the point of noon the huge Earl Doorm,
  Broad-faced with under-fringe of russet beard,
  Bound on a foray, rolling eyes of prey,
  Came riding with a hundred lances up;
  But ere he came, like one that hails a ship,
  Cried out with a big voice, 'What, is he dead?'
  'No, no, not dead!' she answered in all haste.
  'Would some of your people take him up,
  And bear him hence out of this cruel sun?
  Most sure am I, quite sure, he is not dead.'

     Then said Earl Doorm:  'Well, if he be not dead,
  Why wail ye for him thus? ye seem a child.
  And be he dead, I count you for a fool;
  Your wailing will not quicken him:  dead or not,
  Ye mar a comely face with idiot tears.
  Yet, since the face is comely--some of you,
  Here, take him up, and bear him to our hall:
  An if he live, we will have him of our band;
  And if he die, why earth has earth enough
  To hide him.  See ye take the charger too,
  A noble one.'
               He spake, and past away,
  But left two brawny spearmen, who advanced,
  Each growling like a dog, when his good bone
  Seems to be plucked at by the village boys
  Who love to vex him eating, and he fears
  To lose his bone, and lays his foot upon it,
  Gnawing and growling:  so the ruffians growled,
  Fearing to lose, and all for a dead man,
  Their chance of booty from the morning's raid,
  Yet raised and laid him on a litter-bier,
  Such as they brought upon their forays out
  For those that might be wounded; laid him on it
  All in the hollow of his shield, and took
  And bore him to the naked hall of Doorm,
  (His gentle charger following him unled)
  And cast him and the bier in which he lay
  Down on an oaken settle in the hall,
  And then departed, hot in haste to join
  Their luckier mates, but growling as before,
  And cursing their lost time, and the dead man,
  And their own Earl, and their own souls, and her.
  They might as well have blest her:  she was deaf
  To blessing or to cursing save from one.

     So for long hours sat Enid by her lord,
  There in the naked hall, propping his head,
  And chafing his pale hands, and calling to him.
  Till at the last he wakened from his swoon,
  And found his own dear bride propping his head,
  And chafing his faint hands, and calling to him;
  And felt the warm tears falling on his face;
  And said to his own heart, 'She weeps for me:'
  And yet lay still, and feigned himself as dead,
  That he might prove her to the uttermost,
  And say to his own heart, 'She weeps for me.'

     But in the falling afternoon returned
  The huge Earl Doorm with plunder to the hall.
  His lusty spearmen followed him with noise:
  Each hurling down a heap of things that rang
  Against his pavement, cast his lance aside,
  And doffed his helm:  and then there fluttered in,
  Half-bold, half-frighted, with dilated eyes,
  A tribe of women, dressed in many hues,
  And mingled with the spearmen:  and Earl Doorm
  Struck with a knife's haft hard against the board,
  And called for flesh and wine to feed his spears.
  And men brought in whole hogs and quarter beeves,
  And all the hall was dim with steam of flesh:
  And none spake word, but all sat down at once,
  And ate with tumult in the naked hall,
  Feeding like horses when you hear them feed;
  Till Enid shrank far back into herself,
  To shun the wild ways of the lawless tribe.
  But when Earl Doorm had eaten all he would,
  He rolled his eyes about the hall, and found
  A damsel drooping in a corner of it.
  Then he remembered her, and how she wept;
  And out of her there came a power upon him;
  And rising on the sudden he said, 'Eat!
  I never yet beheld a thing so pale.
  God's curse, it makes me mad to see you weep.
  Eat!  Look yourself.  Good luck had your good man,
  For were I dead who is it would weep for me?
  Sweet lady, never since I first drew breath
  Have I beheld a lily like yourself.
  And so there lived some colour in your cheek,
  There is not one among my gentlewomen
  Were fit to wear your slipper for a glove.
  But listen to me, and by me be ruled,
  And I will do the thing I have not done,
  For ye shall share my earldom with me, girl,
  And we will live like two birds in one nest,
  And I will fetch you forage from all fields,
  For I compel all creatures to my will.'

     He spoke:  the brawny spearman let his cheek
  Bulge with the unswallowed piece, and turning stared;
  While some, whose souls the old serpent long had drawn
  Down, as the worm draws in the withered leaf
  And makes it earth, hissed each at other's ear
  What shall not be recorded--women they,
  Women, or what had been those gracious things,
  But now desired the humbling of their best,
  Yea, would have helped him to it:  and all at once
  They hated her, who took no thought of them,
  But answered in low voice, her meek head yet
  Drooping, 'I pray you of your courtesy,
  He being as he is, to let me be.'

     She spake so low he hardly heard her speak,
  But like a mighty patron, satisfied
  With what himself had done so graciously,
  Assumed that she had thanked him, adding, 'Yea,
  Eat and be glad, for I account you mine.'

     She answered meekly, 'How should I be glad
  Henceforth in all the world at anything,
  Until my lord arise and look upon me?'

     Here the huge Earl cried out upon her talk,
  As all but empty heart and weariness
  And sickly nothing; suddenly seized on her,
  And bare her by main violence to the board,
  And thrust the dish before her, crying, 'Eat.'

     'No, no,' said Enid, vext, 'I will not eat
  Till yonder man upon the bier arise,
  And eat with me.'  'Drink, then,' he answered.  'Here!'
  (And filled a horn with wine and held it to her,)
  'Lo! I, myself, when flushed with fight, or hot,
  God's curse, with anger--often I myself,
  Before I well have drunken, scarce can eat:
  Drink therefore and the wine will change thy will.'

     'Not so,' she cried, 'by Heaven, I will not drink
  Till my dear lord arise and bid me do it,
  And drink with me; and if he rise no more,
  I will not look at wine until I die.'

     At this he turned all red and paced his hall,
  Now gnawed his under, now his upper lip,
  And coming up close to her, said at last:
  'Girl, for I see ye scorn my courtesies,
  Take warning:  yonder man is surely dead;
  And I compel all creatures to my will.
  Not eat nor drink?  And wherefore wail for one,
  Who put your beauty to this flout and scorn
  By dressing it in rags?  Amazed am I,
  Beholding how ye butt against my wish,
  That I forbear you thus:  cross me no more.
  At least put off to please me this poor gown,
  This silken rag, this beggar-woman's weed:
  I love that beauty should go beautifully:
  For see ye not my gentlewomen here,
  How gay, how suited to the house of one
  Who loves that beauty should go beautifully?
  Rise therefore; robe yourself in this:  obey.'

     He spoke, and one among his gentlewomen
  Displayed a splendid silk of foreign loom,
  Where like a shoaling sea the lovely blue
  Played into green, and thicker down the front
  With jewels than the sward with drops of dew,
  When all night long a cloud clings to the hill,
  And with the dawn ascending lets the day
  Strike where it clung:  so thickly shone the gems.

     But Enid answered, harder to be moved
  Than hardest tyrants in their day of power,
  With life-long injuries burning unavenged,
  And now their hour has come; and Enid said:

     'In this poor gown my dear lord found me first,
  And loved me serving in my father's hall:
  In this poor gown I rode with him to court,
  And there the Queen arrayed me like the sun:
  In this poor gown he bad me clothe myself,
  When now we rode upon this fatal quest
  Of honour, where no honour can be gained:
  And this poor gown I will not cast aside
  Until himself arise a living man,
  And bid me cast it.  I have griefs enough:
  Pray you be gentle, pray you let me be:
  I never loved, can never love but him:
  Yea, God, I pray you of your gentleness,
  He being as he is, to let me be.'

     Then strode the brute Earl up and down his hall,
  And took his russet beard between his teeth;
  Last, coming up quite close, and in his mood
  Crying, 'I count it of no more avail,
  Dame, to be gentle than ungentle with you;
  Take my salute,' unknightly with flat hand,
  However lightly, smote her on the cheek.

     Then Enid, in her utter helplessness,
  And since she thought, 'He had not dared to do it,
  Except he surely knew my lord was dead,'
  Sent forth a sudden sharp and bitter cry,
  As of a wild thing taken in the trap,
  Which sees the trapper coming through the wood.

     This heard Geraint, and grasping at his sword,
  (It lay beside him in the hollow shield),
  Made but a single bound, and with a sweep of it
  Shore through the swarthy neck, and like a ball
  The russet-bearded head rolled on the floor.
  So died Earl Doorm by him he counted dead.
  And all the men and women in the hall
  Rose when they saw the dead man rise, and fled
  Yelling as from a spectre, and the two
  Were left alone together, and he said:

     'Enid, I have used you worse than that dead man;
  Done you more wrong:  we both have undergone
  That trouble which has left me thrice your own:
  Henceforward I will rather die than doubt.
  And here I lay this penance on myself,
  Not, though mine own ears heard you yestermorn--
  You thought me sleeping, but I heard you say,
  I heard you say, that you were no true wife:
  I swear I will not ask your meaning in it:
  I do believe yourself against yourself,
  And will henceforward rather die than doubt.'

     And Enid could not say one tender word,
  She felt so blunt and stupid at the heart:
  She only prayed him, 'Fly, they will return
  And slay you; fly, your charger is without,
  My palfrey lost.'  'Then, Enid, shall you ride
  Behind me.'  'Yea,' said Enid, 'let us go.'
  And moving out they found the stately horse,
  Who now no more a vassal to the thief,
  But free to stretch his limbs in lawful fight,
  Neighed with all gladness as they came, and stooped
  With a low whinny toward the pair:  and she
  Kissed the white star upon his noble front,
  Glad also; then Geraint upon the horse
  Mounted, and reached a hand, and on his foot
  She set her own and climbed; he turned his face
  And kissed her climbing, and she cast her arms
  About him, and at once they rode away.

     And never yet, since high in Paradise
  O'er the four rivers the first roses blew,
  Came purer pleasure unto mortal kind
  Than lived through her, who in that perilous hour
  Put hand to hand beneath her husband's heart,
  And felt him hers again:  she did not weep,
  But o'er her meek eyes came a happy mist
  Like that which kept the heart of Eden green
  Before the useful trouble of the rain:
  Yet not so misty were her meek blue eyes
  As not to see before them on the path,
  Right in the gateway of the bandit hold,
  A knight of Arthur's court, who laid his lance
  In rest, and made as if to fall upon him.
  Then, fearing for his hurt and loss of blood,
  She, with her mind all full of what had chanced,
  Shrieked to the stranger 'Slay not a dead man!'
  'The voice of Enid,' said the knight; but she,
  Beholding it was Edyrn son of Nudd,
  Was moved so much the more, and shrieked again,
  'O cousin, slay not him who gave you life.'
  And Edyrn moving frankly forward spake:
  'My lord Geraint, I greet you with all love;
  I took you for a bandit knight of Doorm;
  And fear not, Enid, I should fall upon him,
  Who love you, Prince, with something of the love
  Wherewith we love the Heaven that chastens us.
  For once, when I was up so high in pride
  That I was halfway down the slope to Hell,
  By overthrowing me you threw me higher.
  Now, made a knight of Arthur's Table Round,
  And since I knew this Earl, when I myself
  Was half a bandit in my lawless hour,
  I come the mouthpiece of our King to Doorm
  (The King is close behind me) bidding him
  Disband himself, and scatter all his powers,
  Submit, and hear the judgment of the King.'

     'He hears the judgment of the King of kings,'
  Cried the wan Prince; 'and lo, the powers of Doorm
  Are scattered,' and he pointed to the field,
  Where, huddled here and there on mound and knoll,
  Were men and women staring and aghast,
  While some yet fled; and then he plainlier told
  How the huge Earl lay slain within his hall.
  But when the knight besought him, 'Follow me,
  Prince, to the camp, and in the King's own ear
  Speak what has chanced; ye surely have endured
  Strange chances here alone;' that other flushed,
  And hung his head, and halted in reply,
  Fearing the mild face of the blameless King,
  And after madness acted question asked:
  Till Edyrn crying, 'If ye will not go
  To Arthur, then will Arthur come to you,'
  'Enough,' he said, 'I follow,' and they went.
  But Enid in their going had two fears,
  One from the bandit scattered in the field,
  And one from Edyrn.  Every now and then,
  When Edyrn reined his charger at her side,
  She shrank a little.  In a hollow land,
  From which old fires have broken, men may fear
  Fresh fire and ruin.  He, perceiving, said:

     'Fair and dear cousin, you that most had cause
  To fear me, fear no longer, I am changed.
  Yourself were first the blameless cause to make
  My nature's prideful sparkle in the blood
  Break into furious flame; being repulsed
  By Yniol and yourself, I schemed and wrought
  Until I overturned him; then set up
  (With one main purpose ever at my heart)
  My haughty jousts, and took a paramour;
  Did her mock-honour as the fairest fair,
  And, toppling over all antagonism,
  So waxed in pride, that I believed myself
  Unconquerable, for I was wellnigh mad:
  And, but for my main purpose in these jousts,
  I should have slain your father, seized yourself.
  I lived in hope that sometime you would come
  To these my lists with him whom best you loved;
  And there, poor cousin, with your meek blue eyes
  The truest eyes that ever answered Heaven,
  Behold me overturn and trample on him.
  Then, had you cried, or knelt, or prayed to me,
  I should not less have killed him.  And so you came,--
  But once you came,--and with your own true eyes
  Beheld the man you loved (I speak as one
  Speaks of a service done him) overthrow
  My proud self, and my purpose three years old,
  And set his foot upon me, and give me life.
  There was I broken down; there was I saved:
  Though thence I rode all-shamed, hating the life
  He gave me, meaning to be rid of it.
  And all the penance the Queen laid upon me
  Was but to rest awhile within her court;
  Where first as sullen as a beast new-caged,
  And waiting to be treated like a wolf,
  Because I knew my deeds were known, I found,
  Instead of scornful pity or pure scorn,
  Such fine reserve and noble reticence,
  Manners so kind, yet stately, such a grace
  Of tenderest courtesy, that I began
  To glance behind me at my former life,
  And find that it had been the wolf's indeed:
  And oft I talked with Dubric, the high saint,
  Who, with mild heat of holy oratory,
  Subdued me somewhat to that gentleness,
  Which, when it weds with manhood, makes a man.
  And you were often there about the Queen,
  But saw me not, or marked not if you saw;
  Nor did I care or dare to speak with you,
  But kept myself aloof till I was changed;
  And fear not, cousin; I am changed indeed.'

     He spoke, and Enid easily believed,
  Like simple noble natures, credulous
  Of what they long for, good in friend or foe,
  There most in those who most have done them ill.
  And when they reached the camp the King himself
  Advanced to greet them, and beholding her
  Though pale, yet happy, asked her not a word,
  But went apart with Edyrn, whom he held
  In converse for a little, and returned,
  And, gravely smiling, lifted her from horse,
  And kissed her with all pureness, brother-like,
  And showed an empty tent allotted her,
  And glancing for a minute, till he saw her
  Pass into it, turned to the Prince, and said:

     'Prince, when of late ye prayed me for my leave
  To move to your own land, and there defend
  Your marches, I was pricked with some reproof,
  As one that let foul wrong stagnate and be,
  By having looked too much through alien eyes,
  And wrought too long with delegated hands,
  Not used mine own:  but now behold me come
  To cleanse this common sewer of all my realm,
  With Edyrn and with others:  have ye looked
  At Edyrn? have ye seen how nobly changed?
  This work of his is great and wonderful.
  His very face with change of heart is changed.
  The world will not believe a man repents:
  And this wise world of ours is mainly right.
  Full seldom doth a man repent, or use
  Both grace and will to pick the vicious quitch
  Of blood and custom wholly out of him,
  And make all clean, and plant himself afresh.
  Edyrn has done it, weeding all his heart
  As I will weed this land before I go.
  I, therefore, made him of our Table Round,
  Not rashly, but have proved him everyway
  One of our noblest, our most valorous,
  Sanest and most obedient:  and indeed
  This work of Edyrn wrought upon himself
  After a life of violence, seems to me
  A thousand-fold more great and wonderful
  Than if some knight of mine, risking his life,
  My subject with my subjects under him,
  Should make an onslaught single on a realm
  Of robbers, though he slew them one by one,
  And were himself nigh wounded to the death.'

     So spake the King; low bowed the Prince, and felt
  His work was neither great nor wonderful,
  And past to Enid's tent; and thither came
  The King's own leech to look into his hurt;
  And Enid tended on him there; and there
  Her constant motion round him, and the breath
  Of her sweet tendance hovering over him,
  Filled all the genial courses of his blood
  With deeper and with ever deeper love,
  As the south-west that blowing Bala lake
  Fills all the sacred Dee.  So past the days.

     But while Geraint lay healing of his hurt,
  The blameless King went forth and cast his eyes
  On each of all whom Uther left in charge
  Long since, to guard the justice of the King:
  He looked and found them wanting; and as now
  Men weed the white horse on the Berkshire hills
  To keep him bright and clean as heretofore,
  He rooted out the slothful officer
  Or guilty, which for bribe had winked at wrong,
  And in their chairs set up a stronger race
  With hearts and hands, and sent a thousand men
  To till the wastes, and moving everywhere
  Cleared the dark places and let in the law,
  And broke the bandit holds and cleansed the land.

     Then, when Geraint was whole again, they past
  With Arthur to Caerleon upon Usk.
  There the great Queen once more embraced her friend,
  And clothed her in apparel like the day.
  And though Geraint could never take again
  That comfort from their converse which he took
  Before the Queen's fair name was breathed upon,
  He rested well content that all was well.
  Thence after tarrying for a space they rode,
  And fifty knights rode with them to the shores
  Of Severn, and they past to their own land.
  And there he kept the justice of the King
  So vigorously yet mildly, that all hearts
  Applauded, and the spiteful whisper died:
  And being ever foremost in the chase,
  And victor at the tilt and tournament,
  They called him the great Prince and man of men.
  But Enid, whom her ladies loved to call
  Enid the Fair, a grateful people named
  Enid the Good; and in their halls arose
  The cry of children, Enids and Geraints
  Of times to be; nor did he doubt her more,
  But rested in her fealty, till he crowned
  A happy life with a fair death, and fell
  Against the heathen of the Northern Sea
  In battle, fighting for the blameless King.



  Balin and Balan

  Pellam the King, who held and lost with Lot
  In that first war, and had his realm restored
  But rendered tributary, failed of late
  To send his tribute; wherefore Arthur called
  His treasurer, one of many years, and spake,
  'Go thou with him and him and bring it to us,
  Lest we should set one truer on his throne.
  Man's word is God in man.'
                            His Baron said
  'We go but harken:  there be two strange knights
  Who sit near Camelot at a fountain-side,
  A mile beneath the forest, challenging
  And overthrowing every knight who comes.
  Wilt thou I undertake them as we pass,
  And send them to thee?'
                         Arthur laughed upon him.
  'Old friend, too old to be so young, depart,
  Delay not thou for aught, but let them sit,
  Until they find a lustier than themselves.'

     So these departed.  Early, one fair dawn,
  The light-winged spirit of his youth returned
  On Arthur's heart; he armed himself and went,
  So coming to the fountain-side beheld
  Balin and Balan sitting statuelike,
  Brethren, to right and left the spring, that down,
  From underneath a plume of lady-fern,
  Sang, and the sand danced at the bottom of it.
  And on the right of Balin Balin's horse
  Was fast beside an alder, on the left
  Of Balan Balan's near a poplartree.
  'Fair Sirs,' said Arthur, 'wherefore sit ye here?'
  Balin and Balan answered 'For the sake
  Of glory; we be mightier men than all
  In Arthur's court; that also have we proved;
  For whatsoever knight against us came
  Or I or he have easily overthrown.'
  'I too,' said Arthur, 'am of Arthur's hall,
  But rather proven in his Paynim wars
  Than famous jousts; but see, or proven or not,
  Whether me likewise ye can overthrow.'
  And Arthur lightly smote the brethren down,
  And lightly so returned, and no man knew.

     Then Balin rose, and Balan, and beside
  The carolling water set themselves again,
  And spake no word until the shadow turned;
  When from the fringe of coppice round them burst
  A spangled pursuivant, and crying 'Sirs,
  Rise, follow! ye be sent for by the King,'
  They followed; whom when Arthur seeing asked
  'Tell me your names; why sat ye by the well?'
  Balin the stillness of a minute broke
  Saying 'An unmelodious name to thee,
  Balin, "the Savage"--that addition thine--
  My brother and my better, this man here,
  Balan.  I smote upon the naked skull
  A thrall of thine in open hall, my hand
  Was gauntleted, half slew him; for I heard
  He had spoken evil of me; thy just wrath
  Sent me a three-years' exile from thine eyes.
  I have not lived my life delightsomely:
  For I that did that violence to thy thrall,
  Had often wrought some fury on myself,
  Saving for Balan:  those three kingless years
  Have past--were wormwood-bitter to me.  King,
  Methought that if we sat beside the well,
  And hurled to ground what knight soever spurred
  Against us, thou would'st take me gladlier back,
  And make, as ten-times worthier to be thine
  Than twenty Balins, Balan knight.  I have said.
  Not so--not all.  A man of thine today
  Abashed us both, and brake my boast.  Thy will?'
  Said Arthur 'Thou hast ever spoken truth;
  Thy too fierce manhood would not let thee lie.
  Rise, my true knight.  As children learn, be thou
  Wiser for falling! walk with me, and move
  To music with thine Order and the King.
  Thy chair, a grief to all the brethren, stands
  Vacant, but thou retake it, mine again!'

     Thereafter, when Sir Balin entered hall,
  The Lost one Found was greeted as in Heaven
  With joy that blazed itself in woodland wealth
  Of leaf, and gayest garlandage of flowers,
  Along the walls and down the board; they sat,
  And cup clashed cup; they drank and some one sang,
  Sweet-voiced, a song of welcome, whereupon
  Their common shout in chorus, mounting, made
  Those banners of twelve battles overhead
  Stir, as they stirred of old, when Arthur's host
  Proclaimed him Victor, and the day was won.

     Then Balan added to their Order lived
  A wealthier life than heretofore with these
  And Balin, till their embassage returned.

     'Sir King' they brought report 'we hardly found,
  So bushed about it is with gloom, the hall
  Of him to whom ye sent us, Pellam, once
  A Christless foe of thine as ever dashed
  Horse against horse; but seeing that thy realm
  Hath prospered in the name of Christ, the King
  Took, as in rival heat, to holy things;
  And finds himself descended from the Saint
  Arimathaean Joseph; him who first
  Brought the great faith to Britain over seas;
  He boasts his life as purer than thine own;
  Eats scarce enow to keep his pulse abeat;
  Hath pushed aside his faithful wife, nor lets
  Or dame or damsel enter at his gates
  Lest he should be polluted.  This gray King
  Showed us a shrine wherein were wonders--yea--
  Rich arks with priceless bones of martyrdom,
  Thorns of the crown and shivers of the cross,
  And therewithal (for thus he told us) brought
  By holy Joseph thither, that same spear
  Wherewith the Roman pierced the side of Christ.
  He much amazed us; after, when we sought
  The tribute, answered "I have quite foregone
  All matters of this world:  Garlon, mine heir,
  Of him demand it," which this Garlon gave
  With much ado, railing at thine and thee.

     'But when we left, in those deep woods we found
  A knight of thine spear-stricken from behind,
  Dead, whom we buried; more than one of us
  Cried out on Garlon, but a woodman there
  Reported of some demon in the woods
  Was once a man, who driven by evil tongues
  From all his fellows, lived alone, and came
  To learn black magic, and to hate his kind
  With such a hate, that when he died, his soul
  Became a Fiend, which, as the man in life
  Was wounded by blind tongues he saw not whence,
  Strikes from behind.  This woodman showed the cave
  From which he sallies, and wherein he dwelt.
  We saw the hoof-print of a horse, no more.'

     Then Arthur, 'Let who goes before me, see
  He do not fall behind me:  foully slain
  And villainously! who will hunt for me
  This demon of the woods?'  Said Balan, 'I'!
  So claimed the quest and rode away, but first,
  Embracing Balin, 'Good my brother, hear!
  Let not thy moods prevail, when I am gone
  Who used to lay them! hold them outer fiends,
  Who leap at thee to tear thee; shake them aside,
  Dreams ruling when wit sleeps! yea, but to dream
  That any of these would wrong thee, wrongs thyself.
  Witness their flowery welcome.  Bound are they
  To speak no evil.  Truly save for fears,
  My fears for thee, so rich a fellowship
  Would make me wholly blest:  thou one of them,
  Be one indeed:  consider them, and all
  Their bearing in their common bond of love,
  No more of hatred than in Heaven itself,
  No more of jealousy than in Paradise.'

     So Balan warned, and went; Balin remained:
  Who--for but three brief moons had glanced away
  From being knighted till he smote the thrall,
  And faded from the presence into years
  Of exile--now would strictlier set himself
  To learn what Arthur meant by courtesy,
  Manhood, and knighthood; wherefore hovered round
  Lancelot, but when he marked his high sweet smile
  In passing, and a transitory word
  Make knight or churl or child or damsel seem
  From being smiled at happier in themselves--
  Sighed, as a boy lame-born beneath a height,
  That glooms his valley, sighs to see the peak
  Sun-flushed, or touch at night the northern star;
  For one from out his village lately climed
  And brought report of azure lands and fair,
  Far seen to left and right; and he himself
  Hath hardly scaled with help a hundred feet
  Up from the base:  so Balin marvelling oft
  How far beyond him Lancelot seemed to move,
  Groaned, and at times would mutter, 'These be gifts,
  Born with the blood, not learnable, divine,
  Beyond my reach.  Well had I foughten--well--
  In those fierce wars, struck hard--and had I crowned
  With my slain self the heaps of whom I slew--
  So--better!--But this worship of the Queen,
  That honour too wherein she holds him--this,
  This was the sunshine that hath given the man
  A growth, a name that branches o'er the rest,
  And strength against all odds, and what the King
  So prizes--overprizes--gentleness.
  Her likewise would I worship an I might.
  I never can be close with her, as he
  That brought her hither.  Shall I pray the King
  To let me bear some token of his Queen
  Whereon to gaze, remembering her--forget
  My heats and violences? live afresh?
  What, if the Queen disdained to grant it! nay
  Being so stately-gentle, would she make
  My darkness blackness? and with how sweet grace
  She greeted my return!  Bold will I be--
  Some goodly cognizance of Guinevere,
  In lieu of this rough beast upon my shield,
  Langued gules, and toothed with grinning savagery.'

     And Arthur, when Sir Balin sought him, said
  'What wilt thou bear?' Balin was bold, and asked
  To bear her own crown-royal upon shield,
  Whereat she smiled and turned her to the King,
  Who answered 'Thou shalt put the crown to use.
  The crown is but the shadow of the King,
  And this a shadow's shadow, let him have it,
  So this will help him of his violences!'
  'No shadow' said Sir Balin 'O my Queen,
  But light to me! no shadow, O my King,
  But golden earnest of a gentler life!'

     So Balin bare the crown, and all the knights
  Approved him, and the Queen, and all the world
  Made music, and he felt his being move
  In music with his Order, and the King.

     The nightingale, full-toned in middle May,
  Hath ever and anon a note so thin
  It seems another voice in other groves;
  Thus, after some quick burst of sudden wrath,
  The music in him seemed to change, and grow
  Faint and far-off.
                    And once he saw the thrall
  His passion half had gauntleted to death,
  That causer of his banishment and shame,
  Smile at him, as he deemed, presumptuously:
  His arm half rose to strike again, but fell:
  The memory of that cognizance on shield
  Weighted it down, but in himself he moaned:

     'Too high this mount of Camelot for me:
  These high-set courtesies are not for me.
  Shall I not rather prove the worse for these?
  Fierier and stormier from restraining, break
  Into some madness even before the Queen?'

     Thus, as a hearth lit in a mountain home,
  And glancing on the window, when the gloom
  Of twilight deepens round it, seems a flame
  That rages in the woodland far below,
  So when his moods were darkened, court and King
  And all the kindly warmth of Arthur's hall
  Shadowed an angry distance:  yet he strove
  To learn the graces of their Table, fought
  Hard with himself, and seemed at length in peace.

     Then chanced, one morning, that Sir Balin sat
  Close-bowered in that garden nigh the hall.
  A walk of roses ran from door to door;
  A walk of lilies crost it to the bower:
  And down that range of roses the great Queen
  Came with slow steps, the morning on her face;
  And all in shadow from the counter door
  Sir Lancelot as to meet her, then at once,
  As if he saw not, glanced aside, and paced
  The long white walk of lilies toward the bower.
  Followed the Queen; Sir Balin heard her 'Prince,
  Art thou so little loyal to thy Queen,
  As pass without good morrow to thy Queen?'
  To whom Sir Lancelot with his eyes on earth,
  'Fain would I still be loyal to the Queen.'
  'Yea so' she said 'but so to pass me by--
  So loyal scarce is loyal to thyself,
  Whom all men rate the king of courtesy.
  Let be:  ye stand, fair lord, as in a dream.'

     Then Lancelot with his hand among the flowers
  'Yea--for a dream.  Last night methought I saw
  That maiden Saint who stands with lily in hand
  In yonder shrine.  All round her prest the dark,
  And all the light upon her silver face
  Flowed from the spiritual lily that she held.
  Lo! these her emblems drew mine eyes--away:
  For see, how perfect-pure!  As light a flush
  As hardly tints the blossom of the quince
  Would mar their charm of stainless maidenhood.'

     'Sweeter to me' she said 'this garden rose
  Deep-hued and many-folded! sweeter still
  The wild-wood hyacinth and the bloom of May.
  Prince, we have ridden before among the flowers
  In those fair days--not all as cool as these,
  Though season-earlier.  Art thou sad? or sick?
  Our noble King will send thee his own leech--
  Sick? or for any matter angered at me?'

     Then Lancelot lifted his large eyes; they dwelt
  Deep-tranced on hers, and could not fall:  her hue
  Changed at his gaze:  so turning side by side
  They past, and Balin started from his bower.

     'Queen? subject? but I see not what I see.
  Damsel and lover? hear not what I hear.
  My father hath begotten me in his wrath.
  I suffer from the things before me, know,
  Learn nothing; am not worthy to be knight;
  A churl, a clown!' and in him gloom on gloom
  Deepened:  he sharply caught his lance and shield,
  Nor stayed to crave permission of the King,
  But, mad for strange adventure, dashed away.

     He took the selfsame track as Balan, saw
  The fountain where they sat together, sighed
  'Was I not better there with him?' and rode
  The skyless woods, but under open blue
  Came on the hoarhead woodman at a bough
  Wearily hewing.  'Churl, thine axe!' he cried,
  Descended, and disjointed it at a blow:
  To whom the woodman uttered wonderingly
  'Lord, thou couldst lay the Devil of these woods
  If arm of flesh could lay him.'  Balin cried
  'Him, or the viler devil who plays his part,
  To lay that devil would lay the Devil in me.'
  'Nay' said the churl, 'our devil is a truth,
  I saw the flash of him but yestereven.
  And some do say that our Sir Garlon too
  Hath learned black magic, and to ride unseen.
  Look to the cave.'  But Balin answered him
  'Old fabler, these be fancies of the churl,
  Look to thy woodcraft,' and so leaving him,
  Now with slack rein and careless of himself,
  Now with dug spur and raving at himself,
  Now with droopt brow down the long glades he rode;
  So marked not on his right a cavern-chasm
  Yawn over darkness, where, nor far within,
  The whole day died, but, dying, gleamed on rocks
  Roof-pendent, sharp; and others from the floor,
  Tusklike, arising, made that mouth of night
  Whereout the Demon issued up from Hell.
  He marked not this, but blind and deaf to all
  Save that chained rage, which ever yelpt within,
  Past eastward from the falling sun.  At once
  He felt the hollow-beaten mosses thud
  And tremble, and then the shadow of a spear,
  Shot from behind him, ran along the ground.
  Sideways he started from the path, and saw,
  With pointed lance as if to pierce, a shape,
  A light of armour by him flash, and pass
  And vanish in the woods; and followed this,
  But all so blind in rage that unawares
  He burst his lance against a forest bough,
  Dishorsed himself, and rose again, and fled
  Far, till the castle of a King, the hall
  Of Pellam, lichen-bearded, grayly draped
  With streaming grass, appeared, low-built but strong;
  The ruinous donjon as a knoll of moss,
  The battlement overtopt with ivytods,
  A home of bats, in every tower an owl.
     Then spake the men of Pellam crying 'Lord,
  Why wear ye this crown-royal upon shield?'
  Said Balin 'For the fairest and the best
  Of ladies living gave me this to bear.'
  So stalled his horse, and strode across the court,
  But found the greetings both of knight and King
  Faint in the low dark hall of banquet:  leaves
  Laid their green faces flat against the panes,
  Sprays grated, and the cankered boughs without
  Whined in the wood; for all was hushed within,
  Till when at feast Sir Garlon likewise asked
  'Why wear ye that crown-royal?' Balin said
  'The Queen we worship, Lancelot, I, and all,
  As fairest, best and purest, granted me
  To bear it!'  Such a sound (for Arthur's knights
  Were hated strangers in the hall) as makes
  The white swan-mother, sitting, when she hears
  A strange knee rustle through her secret reeds,
  Made Garlon, hissing; then he sourly smiled.
  'Fairest I grant her:  I have seen; but best,
  Best, purest? thou from Arthur's hall, and yet
  So simple! hast thou eyes, or if, are these
  So far besotted that they fail to see
  This fair wife-worship cloaks a secret shame?
  Truly, ye men of Arthur be but babes.'

     A goblet on the board by Balin, bossed
  With holy Joseph's legend, on his right
  Stood, all of massiest bronze:  one side had sea
  And ship and sail and angels blowing on it:
  And one was rough with wattling, and the walls
  Of that low church he built at Glastonbury.
  This Balin graspt, but while in act to hurl,
  Through memory of that token on the shield
  Relaxed his hold:  'I will be gentle' he thought
  'And passing gentle' caught his hand away,
  Then fiercely to Sir Garlon 'Eyes have I
  That saw today the shadow of a spear,
  Shot from behind me, run along the ground;
  Eyes too that long have watched how Lancelot draws
  From homage to the best and purest, might,
  Name, manhood, and a grace, but scantly thine,
  Who, sitting in thine own hall, canst endure
  To mouth so huge a foulness--to thy guest,
  Me, me of Arthur's Table.  Felon talk!
  Let be! no more!'
                   But not the less by night
  The scorn of Garlon, poisoning all his rest,
  Stung him in dreams.  At length, and dim through leaves
  Blinkt the white morn, sprays grated, and old boughs
  Whined in the wood.  He rose, descended, met
  The scorner in the castle court, and fain,
  For hate and loathing, would have past him by;
  But when Sir Garlon uttered mocking-wise;
  'What, wear ye still that same crown-scandalous?'
  His countenance blackened, and his forehead veins
  Bloated, and branched; and tearing out of sheath
  The brand, Sir Balin with a fiery 'Ha!
  So thou be shadow, here I make thee ghost,'
  Hard upon helm smote him, and the blade flew
  Splintering in six, and clinkt upon the stones.
  Then Garlon, reeling slowly backward, fell,
  And Balin by the banneret of his helm
  Dragged him, and struck, but from the castle a cry
  Sounded across the court, and--men-at-arms,
  A score with pointed lances, making at him--
  He dashed the pummel at the foremost face,
  Beneath a low door dipt, and made his feet
  Wings through a glimmering gallery, till he marked
  The portal of King Pellam's chapel wide
  And inward to the wall; he stept behind;
  Thence in a moment heard them pass like wolves
  Howling; but while he stared about the shrine,
  In which he scarce could spy the Christ for Saints,
  Beheld before a golden altar lie
  The longest lance his eyes had ever seen,
  Point-painted red; and seizing thereupon
  Pushed through an open casement down, leaned on it,
  Leapt in a semicircle, and lit on earth;
  Then hand at ear, and harkening from what side
  The blindfold rummage buried in the walls
  Might echo, ran the counter path, and found
  His charger, mounted on him and away.
  An arrow whizzed to the right, one to the left,
  One overhead; and Pellam's feeble cry
  'Stay, stay him! he defileth heavenly things
  With earthly uses'--made him quickly dive
  Beneath the boughs, and race through many a mile
  Of dense and open, till his goodly horse,
  Arising wearily at a fallen oak,
  Stumbled headlong, and cast him face to ground.

     Half-wroth he had not ended, but all glad,
  Knightlike, to find his charger yet unlamed,
  Sir Balin drew the shield from off his neck,
  Stared at the priceless cognizance, and thought
  'I have shamed thee so that now thou shamest me,
  Thee will I bear no more,' high on a branch
  Hung it, and turned aside into the woods,
  And there in gloom cast himself all along,
  Moaning 'My violences, my violences!'

     But now the wholesome music of the wood
  Was dumbed by one from out the hall of Mark,
  A damsel-errant, warbling, as she rode
  The woodland alleys, Vivien, with her Squire.

     'The fire of Heaven has killed the barren cold,
  And kindled all the plain and all the wold.
  The new leaf ever pushes off the old.
  The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.

     'Old priest, who mumble worship in your quire--
  Old monk and nun, ye scorn the world's desire,
  Yet in your frosty cells ye feel the fire!
  The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.

     'The fire of Heaven is on the dusty ways.
  The wayside blossoms open to the blaze.
  The whole wood-world is one full peal of praise.
  The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell.

     'The fire of Heaven is lord of all things good,
  And starve not thou this fire within thy blood,
  But follow Vivien through the fiery flood!
  The fire of Heaven is not the flame of Hell!'

     Then turning to her Squire 'This fire of Heaven,
  This old sun-worship, boy, will rise again,
  And beat the cross to earth, and break the King
  And all his Table.'
                     Then they reached a glade,
  Where under one long lane of cloudless air
  Before another wood, the royal crown
  Sparkled, and swaying upon a restless elm
  Drew the vague glance of Vivien, and her Squire;
  Amazed were these; 'Lo there' she cried--'a crown--
  Borne by some high lord-prince of Arthur's hall,
  And there a horse! the rider? where is he?
  See, yonder lies one dead within the wood.
  Not dead; he stirs!--but sleeping.  I will speak.
  Hail, royal knight, we break on thy sweet rest,
  Not, doubtless, all unearned by noble deeds.
  But bounden art thou, if from Arthur's hall,
  To help the weak.  Behold, I fly from shame,
  A lustful King, who sought to win my love
  Through evil ways:  the knight, with whom I rode,
  Hath suffered misadventure, and my squire
  Hath in him small defence; but thou, Sir Prince,
  Wilt surely guide me to the warrior King,
  Arthur the blameless, pure as any maid,
  To get me shelter for my maidenhood.
  I charge thee by that crown upon thy shield,
  And by the great Queen's name, arise and hence.'

     And Balin rose, 'Thither no more! nor Prince
  Nor knight am I, but one that hath defamed
  The cognizance she gave me:  here I dwell
  Savage among the savage woods, here die--
  Die:  let the wolves' black maws ensepulchre
  Their brother beast, whose anger was his lord.
  O me, that such a name as Guinevere's,
  Which our high Lancelot hath so lifted up,
  And been thereby uplifted, should through me,
  My violence, and my villainy, come to shame.'

     Thereat she suddenly laughed and shrill, anon
  Sighed all as suddenly.  Said Balin to her
  'Is this thy courtesy--to mock me, ha?
  Hence, for I will not with thee.'  Again she sighed
  'Pardon, sweet lord! we maidens often laugh
  When sick at heart, when rather we should weep.
  I knew thee wronged.  I brake upon thy rest,
  And now full loth am I to break thy dream,
  But thou art man, and canst abide a truth,
  Though bitter.  Hither, boy--and mark me well.
  Dost thou remember at Caerleon once--
  A year ago--nay, then I love thee not--
  Ay, thou rememberest well--one summer dawn--
  By the great tower--Caerleon upon Usk--
  Nay, truly we were hidden:  this fair lord,
  The flower of all their vestal knighthood, knelt
  In amorous homage--knelt--what else?--O ay
  Knelt, and drew down from out his night-black hair
  And mumbled that white hand whose ringed caress
  Had wandered from her own King's golden head,
  And lost itself in darkness, till she cried--
  I thought the great tower would crash down on both--
  "Rise, my sweet King, and kiss me on the lips,
  Thou art my King."  This lad, whose lightest word
  Is mere white truth in simple nakedness,
  Saw them embrace:  he reddens, cannot speak,
  So bashful, he! but all the maiden Saints,
  The deathless mother-maidenhood of Heaven,
  Cry out upon her.  Up then, ride with me!
  Talk not of shame! thou canst not, an thou would'st,
  Do these more shame than these have done themselves.'

     She lied with ease; but horror-stricken he,
  Remembering that dark bower at Camelot,
  Breathed in a dismal whisper 'It is truth.'

     Sunnily she smiled 'And even in this lone wood,
  Sweet lord, ye do right well to whisper this.
  Fools prate, and perish traitors.  Woods have tongues,
  As walls have ears:  but thou shalt go with me,
  And we will speak at first exceeding low.
  Meet is it the good King be not deceived.
  See now, I set thee high on vantage ground,
  From whence to watch the time, and eagle-like
  Stoop at thy will on Lancelot and the Queen.'

     She ceased; his evil spirit upon him leapt,
  He ground his teeth together, sprang with a yell,
  Tore from the branch, and cast on earth, the shield,
  Drove his mailed heel athwart the royal crown,
  Stampt all into defacement, hurled it from him
  Among the forest weeds, and cursed the tale,
  The told-of, and the teller.
                              That weird yell,
  Unearthlier than all shriek of bird or beast,
  Thrilled through the woods; and Balan lurking there
  (His quest was unaccomplished) heard and thought
  'The scream of that Wood-devil I came to quell!'
  Then nearing 'Lo! he hath slain some brother-knight,
  And tramples on the goodly shield to show
  His loathing of our Order and the Queen.
  My quest, meseems, is here.  Or devil or man
  Guard thou thine head.'  Sir Balin spake not word,
  But snatched a sudden buckler from the Squire,
  And vaulted on his horse, and so they crashed
  In onset, and King Pellam's holy spear,
  Reputed to be red with sinless blood,
  Redded at once with sinful, for the point
  Across the maiden shield of Balan pricked
  The hauberk to the flesh; and Balin's horse
  Was wearied to the death, and, when they clashed,
  Rolling back upon Balin, crushed the man
  Inward, and either fell, and swooned away.

     Then to her Squire muttered the damsel 'Fools!
  This fellow hath wrought some foulness with his Queen:
  Else never had he borne her crown, nor raved
  And thus foamed over at a rival name:
  But thou, Sir Chick, that scarce hast broken shell,
  Art yet half-yolk, not even come to down--
  Who never sawest Caerleon upon Usk--
  And yet hast often pleaded for my love--
  See what I see, be thou where I have been,
  Or else Sir Chick--dismount and loose their casques
  I fain would know what manner of men they be.'
  And when the Squire had loosed them, 'Goodly!--look!
  They might have cropt the myriad flower of May,
  And butt each other here, like brainless bulls,
  Dead for one heifer!
                      Then the gentle Squire
  'I hold them happy, so they died for love:
  And, Vivien, though ye beat me like your dog,
  I too could die, as now I live, for thee.'

     'Live on, Sir Boy,' she cried.  'I better prize
  The living dog than the dead lion:  away!
  I cannot brook to gaze upon the dead.'
  Then leapt her palfrey o'er the fallen oak,
  And bounding forward 'Leave them to the wolves.'

     But when their foreheads felt the cooling air,
  Balin first woke, and seeing that true face,
  Familiar up from cradle-time, so wan,
  Crawled slowly with low moans to where he lay,
  And on his dying brother cast himself
  Dying; and he lifted faint eyes; he felt
  One near him; all at once they found the world,
  Staring wild-wide; then with a childlike wail
  And drawing down the dim disastrous brow
  That o'er him hung, he kissed it, moaned and spake;

     'O Balin, Balin, I that fain had died
  To save thy life, have brought thee to thy death.
  Why had ye not the shield I knew? and why
  Trampled ye thus on that which bare the Crown?'

     Then Balin told him brokenly, and in gasps,
  All that had chanced, and Balan moaned again.

     'Brother, I dwelt a day in Pellam's hall:
  This Garlon mocked me, but I heeded not.
  And one said "Eat in peace! a liar is he,
  And hates thee for the tribute!" this good knight
  Told me, that twice a wanton damsel came,
  And sought for Garlon at the castle-gates,
  Whom Pellam drove away with holy heat.
  I well believe this damsel, and the one
  Who stood beside thee even now, the same.
  "She dwells among the woods" he said "and meets
  And dallies with him in the Mouth of Hell."
  Foul are their lives; foul are their lips; they lied.
  Pure as our own true Mother is our Queen."

     'O brother' answered Balin 'woe is me!
  My madness all thy life has been thy doom,
  Thy curse, and darkened all thy day; and now
  The night has come.  I scarce can see thee now.

  Goodnight! for we shall never bid again
  Goodmorrow--Dark my doom was here, and dark
  It will be there.  I see thee now no more.
  I would not mine again should darken thine,
  Goodnight, true brother.
                          Balan answered low
  'Goodnight, true brother here! goodmorrow there!
  We two were born together, and we die
  Together by one doom:' and while he spoke
  Closed his death-drowsing eyes, and slept the sleep
  With Balin, either locked in either's arm.



  Merlin and Vivien

  A storm was coming, but the winds were still,
  And in the wild woods of Broceliande,
  Before an oak, so hollow, huge and old
  It looked a tower of ivied masonwork,
  At Merlin's feet the wily Vivien lay.

     For he that always bare in bitter grudge
  The slights of Arthur and his Table, Mark
  The Cornish King, had heard a wandering voice,
  A minstrel of Caerlon by strong storm
  Blown into shelter at Tintagil, say
  That out of naked knightlike purity
  Sir Lancelot worshipt no unmarried girl
  But the great Queen herself, fought in her name,
  Sware by her--vows like theirs, that high in heaven
  Love most, but neither marry, nor are given
  In marriage, angels of our Lord's report.

     He ceased, and then--for Vivien sweetly said
  (She sat beside the banquet nearest Mark),
  'And is the fair example followed, Sir,
  In Arthur's household?'--answered innocently:

     'Ay, by some few--ay, truly--youths that hold
  It more beseems the perfect virgin knight
  To worship woman as true wife beyond
  All hopes of gaining, than as maiden girl.
  They place their pride in Lancelot and the Queen.
  So passionate for an utter purity
  Beyond the limit of their bond, are these,
  For Arthur bound them not to singleness.
  Brave hearts and clean! and yet--God guide them--young.'

     Then Mark was half in heart to hurl his cup
  Straight at the speaker, but forbore:  he rose
  To leave the hall, and, Vivien following him,
  Turned to her:  'Here are snakes within the grass;
  And you methinks, O Vivien, save ye fear
  The monkish manhood, and the mask of pure
  Worn by this court, can stir them till they sting.'

     And Vivien answered, smiling scornfully,
  'Why fear? because that fostered at thy court
  I savour of thy--virtues? fear them? no.
  As Love, if Love is perfect, casts out fear,
  So Hate, if Hate is perfect, casts out fear.
  My father died in battle against the King,
  My mother on his corpse in open field;
  She bore me there, for born from death was I
  Among the dead and sown upon the wind--
  And then on thee! and shown the truth betimes,
  That old true filth, and bottom of the well
  Where Truth is hidden.  Gracious lessons thine
  And maxims of the mud!  "This Arthur pure!
  Great Nature through the flesh herself hath made
  Gives him the lie!  There is no being pure,
  My cherub; saith not Holy Writ the same?"--
  If I were Arthur, I would have thy blood.
  Thy blessing, stainless King!  I bring thee back,
  When I have ferreted out their burrowings,
  The hearts of all this Order in mine hand--
  Ay--so that fate and craft and folly close,
  Perchance, one curl of Arthur's golden beard.
  To me this narrow grizzled fork of thine
  Is cleaner-fashioned--Well, I loved thee first,
  That warps the wit.'

                      Loud laughed the graceless Mark,
  But Vivien, into Camelot stealing, lodged
  Low in the city, and on a festal day
  When Guinevere was crossing the great hall
  Cast herself down, knelt to the Queen, and wailed.

     'Why kneel ye there?  What evil hath ye wrought?
  Rise!' and the damsel bidden rise arose
  And stood with folded hands and downward eyes
  Of glancing corner, and all meekly said,
  'None wrought, but suffered much, an orphan maid!
  My father died in battle for thy King,
  My mother on his corpse--in open field,
  The sad sea-sounding wastes of Lyonnesse--
  Poor wretch--no friend!--and now by Mark the King
  For that small charm of feature mine, pursued--
  If any such be mine--I fly to thee.
  Save, save me thou--Woman of women--thine
  The wreath of beauty, thine the crown of power,
  Be thine the balm of pity, O Heaven's own white
  Earth-angel, stainless bride of stainless King--
  Help, for he follows! take me to thyself!
  O yield me shelter for mine innocency
  Among thy maidens!

                    Here her slow sweet eyes
  Fear-tremulous, but humbly hopeful, rose
  Fixt on her hearer's, while the Queen who stood
  All glittering like May sunshine on May leaves
  In green and gold, and plumed with green replied,
  'Peace, child! of overpraise and overblame
  We choose the last.  Our noble Arthur, him
  Ye scarce can overpraise, will hear and know.
  Nay--we believe all evil of thy Mark--
  Well, we shall test thee farther; but this hour
  We ride a-hawking with Sir Lancelot.
  He hath given us a fair falcon which he trained;
  We go to prove it.  Bide ye here the while.'

     She past; and Vivien murmured after 'Go!
  I bide the while.'  Then through the portal-arch
  Peering askance, and muttering broken-wise,
  As one that labours with an evil dream,
  Beheld the Queen and Lancelot get to horse.

     'Is that the Lancelot? goodly--ay, but gaunt:
  Courteous--amends for gauntness--takes her hand--
  That glance of theirs, but for the street, had been
  A clinging kiss--how hand lingers in hand!
  Let go at last!--they ride away--to hawk
  For waterfowl.  Royaller game is mine.
  For such a supersensual sensual bond
  As that gray cricket chirpt of at our hearth--
  Touch flax with flame--a glance will serve--the liars!
  Ah little rat that borest in the dyke
  Thy hole by night to let the boundless deep
  Down upon far-off cities while they dance--
  Or dream--of thee they dreamed not--nor of me
  These--ay, but each of either:  ride, and dream
  The mortal dream that never yet was mine--
  Ride, ride and dream until ye wake--to me!
  Then, narrow court and lubber King, farewell!
  For Lancelot will be gracious to the rat,
  And our wise Queen, if knowing that I know,
  Will hate, loathe, fear--but honour me the more.'

     Yet while they rode together down the plain,
  Their talk was all of training, terms of art,
  Diet and seeling, jesses, leash and lure.
  'She is too noble' he said 'to check at pies,
  Nor will she rake:  there is no baseness in her.'
  Here when the Queen demanded as by chance
  'Know ye the stranger woman?'  'Let her be,'
  Said Lancelot and unhooded casting off
  The goodly falcon free; she towered; her bells,
  Tone under tone, shrilled; and they lifted up
  Their eager faces, wondering at the strength,
  Boldness and royal knighthood of the bird
  Who pounced her quarry and slew it.  Many a time
  As once--of old--among the flowers--they rode.

     But Vivien half-forgotten of the Queen
  Among her damsels broidering sat, heard, watched
  And whispered:  through the peaceful court she crept
  And whispered:  then as Arthur in the highest
  Leavened the world, so Vivien in the lowest,
  Arriving at a time of golden rest,
  And sowing one ill hint from ear to ear,
  While all the heathen lay at Arthur's feet,
  And no quest came, but all was joust and play,
  Leavened his hall.  They heard and let her be.

     Thereafter as an enemy that has left
  Death in the living waters, and withdrawn,
  The wily Vivien stole from Arthur's court.

     She hated all the knights, and heard in thought
  Their lavish comment when her name was named.
  For once, when Arthur walking all alone,
  Vext at a rumour issued from herself
  Of some corruption crept among his knights,
  Had met her, Vivien, being greeted fair,
  Would fain have wrought upon his cloudy mood
  With reverent eyes mock-loyal, shaken voice,
  And fluttered adoration, and at last
  With dark sweet hints of some who prized him more
  Than who should prize him most; at which the King
  Had gazed upon her blankly and gone by:
  But one had watched, and had not held his peace:
  It made the laughter of an afternoon
  That Vivien should attempt the blameless King.
  And after that, she set herself to gain
  Him, the most famous man of all those times,
  Merlin, who knew the range of all their arts,
  Had built the King his havens, ships, and halls,
  Was also Bard, and knew the starry heavens;
  The people called him Wizard; whom at first
  She played about with slight and sprightly talk,
  And vivid smiles, and faintly-venomed points
  Of slander, glancing here and grazing there;
  And yielding to his kindlier moods, the Seer
  Would watch her at her petulance, and play,
  Even when they seemed unloveable, and laugh
  As those that watch a kitten; thus he grew
  Tolerant of what he half disdained, and she,
  Perceiving that she was but half disdained,
  Began to break her sports with graver fits,
  Turn red or pale, would often when they met
  Sigh fully, or all-silent gaze upon him
  With such a fixt devotion, that the old man,
  Though doubtful, felt the flattery, and at times
  Would flatter his own wish in age for love,
  And half believe her true:  for thus at times
  He wavered; but that other clung to him,
  Fixt in her will, and so the seasons went.

     Then fell on Merlin a great melancholy;
  He walked with dreams and darkness, and he found
  A doom that ever poised itself to fall,
  An ever-moaning battle in the mist,
  World-war of dying flesh against the life,
  Death in all life and lying in all love,
  The meanest having power upon the highest,
  And the high purpose broken by the worm.

     So leaving Arthur's court he gained the beach;
  There found a little boat, and stept into it;
  And Vivien followed, but he marked her not.
  She took the helm and he the sail; the boat
  Drave with a sudden wind across the deeps,
  And touching Breton sands, they disembarked.
  And then she followed Merlin all the way,
  Even to the wild woods of Broceliande.
  For Merlin once had told her of a charm,
  The which if any wrought on anyone
  With woven paces and with waving arms,
  The man so wrought on ever seemed to lie
  Closed in the four walls of a hollow tower,
  From which was no escape for evermore;
  And none could find that man for evermore,
  Nor could he see but him who wrought the charm
  Coming and going, and he lay as dead
  And lost to life and use and name and fame.
  And Vivien ever sought to work the charm
  Upon the great Enchanter of the Time,
  As fancying that her glory would be great
  According to his greatness whom she quenched.

     There lay she all her length and kissed his feet,
  As if in deepest reverence and in love.
  A twist of gold was round her hair; a robe
  Of samite without price, that more exprest
  Than hid her, clung about her lissome limbs,
  In colour like the satin-shining palm
  On sallows in the windy gleams of March:
  And while she kissed them, crying, 'Trample me,
  Dear feet, that I have followed through the world,
  And I will pay you worship; tread me down
  And I will kiss you for it;' he was mute:
  So dark a forethought rolled about his brain,
  As on a dull day in an Ocean cave
  The blind wave feeling round his long sea-hall
  In silence:  wherefore, when she lifted up
  A face of sad appeal, and spake and said,
  'O Merlin, do ye love me?' and again,
  'O Merlin, do ye love me?' and once more,
  'Great Master, do ye love me?' he was mute.
  And lissome Vivien, holding by his heel,
  Writhed toward him, slided up his knee and sat,
  Behind his ankle twined her hollow feet
  Together, curved an arm about his neck,
  Clung like a snake; and letting her left hand
  Droop from his mighty shoulder, as a leaf,
  Made with her right a comb of pearl to part
  The lists of such a board as youth gone out
  Had left in ashes:  then he spoke and said,
  Not looking at her, 'Who are wise in love
  Love most, say least,' and Vivien answered quick,
  'I saw the little elf-god eyeless once
  In Arthur's arras hall at Camelot:
  But neither eyes nor tongue--O stupid child!
  Yet you are wise who say it; let me think
  Silence is wisdom:  I am silent then,
  And ask no kiss;' then adding all at once,
  'And lo, I clothe myself with wisdom,' drew
  The vast and shaggy mantle of his beard
  Across her neck and bosom to her knee,
  And called herself a gilded summer fly
  Caught in a great old tyrant spider's web,
  Who meant to eat her up in that wild wood
  Without one word.  So Vivien called herself,
  But rather seemed a lovely baleful star
  Veiled in gray vapour; till he sadly smiled:
  'To what request for what strange boon,' he said,
  'Are these your pretty tricks and fooleries,
  O Vivien, the preamble? yet my thanks,
  For these have broken up my melancholy.'

     And Vivien answered smiling saucily,
  'What, O my Master, have ye found your voice?
  I bid the stranger welcome.  Thanks at last!
  But yesterday you never opened lip,
  Except indeed to drink:  no cup had we:
  In mine own lady palms I culled the spring
  That gathered trickling dropwise from the cleft,
  And made a pretty cup of both my hands
  And offered you it kneeling:  then you drank
  And knew no more, nor gave me one poor word;
  O no more thanks than might a goat have given
  With no more sign of reverence than a beard.
  And when we halted at that other well,
  And I was faint to swooning, and you lay
  Foot-gilt with all the blossom-dust of those
  Deep meadows we had traversed, did you know
  That Vivien bathed your feet before her own?
  And yet no thanks:  and all through this wild wood
  And all this morning when I fondled you:
  Boon, ay, there was a boon, one not so strange--
  How had I wronged you? surely ye are wise,
  But such a silence is more wise than kind.'

     And Merlin locked his hand in hers and said:
  'O did ye never lie upon the shore,
  And watch the curled white of the coming wave
  Glassed in the slippery sand before it breaks?
  Even such a wave, but not so pleasurable,
  Dark in the glass of some presageful mood,
  Had I for three days seen, ready to fall.
  And then I rose and fled from Arthur's court
  To break the mood.  You followed me unasked;
  And when I looked, and saw you following me still,
  My mind involved yourself the nearest thing
  In that mind-mist:  for shall I tell you truth?
  You seemed that wave about to break upon me
  And sweep me from my hold upon the world,
  My use and name and fame.  Your pardon, child.
  Your pretty sports have brightened all again.
  And ask your boon, for boon I owe you thrice,
  Once for wrong done you by confusion, next
  For thanks it seems till now neglected, last
  For these your dainty gambols:  wherefore ask;
  And take this boon so strange and not so strange.'

     And Vivien answered smiling mournfully:
  'O not so strange as my long asking it,
  Not yet so strange as you yourself are strange,
  Nor half so strange as that dark mood of yours.
  I ever feared ye were not wholly mine;
  And see, yourself have owned ye did me wrong.
  The people call you prophet:  let it be:
  But not of those that can expound themselves.
  Take Vivien for expounder; she will call
  That three-days-long presageful gloom of yours
  No presage, but the same mistrustful mood
  That makes you seem less noble than yourself,
  Whenever I have asked this very boon,
  Now asked again:  for see you not, dear love,
  That such a mood as that, which lately gloomed
  Your fancy when ye saw me following you,
  Must make me fear still more you are not mine,
  Must make me yearn still more to prove you mine,
  And make me wish still more to learn this charm
  Of woven paces and of waving hands,
  As proof of trust.  O Merlin, teach it me.
  The charm so taught will charm us both to rest.
  For, grant me some slight power upon your fate,
  I, feeling that you felt me worthy trust,
  Should rest and let you rest, knowing you mine.
  And therefore be as great as ye are named,
  Not muffled round with selfish reticence.
  How hard you look and how denyingly!
  O, if you think this wickedness in me,
  That I should prove it on you unawares,
  That makes me passing wrathful; then our bond
  Had best be loosed for ever:  but think or not,
  By Heaven that hears I tell you the clean truth,
  As clean as blood of babes, as white as milk:
  O Merlin, may this earth, if ever I,
  If these unwitty wandering wits of mine,
  Even in the jumbled rubbish of a dream,
  Have tript on such conjectural treachery--
  May this hard earth cleave to the Nadir hell
  Down, down, and close again, and nip me flat,
  If I be such a traitress.  Yield my boon,
  Till which I scarce can yield you all I am;
  And grant my re-reiterated wish,
  The great proof of your love:  because I think,
  However wise, ye hardly know me yet.'

     And Merlin loosed his hand from hers and said,
  'I never was less wise, however wise,
  Too curious Vivien, though you talk of trust,
  Than when I told you first of such a charm.
  Yea, if ye talk of trust I tell you this,
  Too much I trusted when I told you that,
  And stirred this vice in you which ruined man
  Through woman the first hour; for howsoe'er
  In children a great curiousness be well,
  Who have to learn themselves and all the world,
  In you, that are no child, for still I find
  Your face is practised when I spell the lines,
  I call it,--well, I will not call it vice:
  But since you name yourself the summer fly,
  I well could wish a cobweb for the gnat,
  That settles, beaten back, and beaten back
  Settles, till one could yield for weariness:
  But since I will not yield to give you power
  Upon my life and use and name and fame,
  Why will ye never ask some other boon?
  Yea, by God's rood, I trusted you too much.'

     And Vivien, like the tenderest-hearted maid
  That ever bided tryst at village stile,
  Made answer, either eyelid wet with tears:
  'Nay, Master, be not wrathful with your maid;
  Caress her:  let her feel herself forgiven
  Who feels no heart to ask another boon.
  I think ye hardly know the tender rhyme
  Of "trust me not at all or all in all."
  I heard the great Sir Lancelot sing it once,
  And it shall answer for me.  Listen to it.

     "In Love, if Love be Love, if Love be ours,
  Faith and unfaith can ne'er be equal powers:
  Unfaith in aught is want of faith in all.

     "It is the little rift within the lute,
  That by and by will make the music mute,
  And ever widening slowly silence all.

     "The little rift within the lover's lute
  Or little pitted speck in garnered fruit,
  That rotting inward slowly moulders all.

     "It is not worth the keeping:  let it go:
  But shall it? answer, darling, answer, no.
  And trust me not at all or all in all."

  O Master, do ye love my tender rhyme?'

     And Merlin looked and half believed her true,
  So tender was her voice, so fair her face,
  So sweetly gleamed her eyes behind her tears
  Like sunlight on the plain behind a shower:
  And yet he answered half indignantly:

     'Far other was the song that once I heard
  By this huge oak, sung nearly where we sit:
  For here we met, some ten or twelve of us,
  To chase a creature that was current then
  In these wild woods, the hart with golden horns.
  It was the time when first the question rose
  About the founding of a Table Round,
  That was to be, for love of God and men
  And noble deeds, the flower of all the world.
  And each incited each to noble deeds.
  And while we waited, one, the youngest of us,
  We could not keep him silent, out he flashed,
  And into such a song, such fire for fame,
  Such trumpet-glowings in it, coming down
  To such a stern and iron-clashing close,
  That when he stopt we longed to hurl together,
  And should have done it; but the beauteous beast
  Scared by the noise upstarted at our feet,
  And like a silver shadow slipt away
  Through the dim land; and all day long we rode
  Through the dim land against a rushing wind,
  That glorious roundel echoing in our ears,
  And chased the flashes of his golden horns
  Till they vanished by the fairy well
  That laughs at iron--as our warriors did--
  Where children cast their pins and nails, and cry,
  "Laugh, little well!" but touch it with a sword,
  It buzzes fiercely round the point; and there
  We lost him:  such a noble song was that.
  But, Vivien, when you sang me that sweet rhyme,
  I felt as though you knew this cursed charm,
  Were proving it on me, and that I lay
  And felt them slowly ebbing, name and fame.'

     And Vivien answered smiling mournfully:
  'O mine have ebbed away for evermore,
  And all through following you to this wild wood,
  Because I saw you sad, to comfort you.
  Lo now, what hearts have men! they never mount
  As high as woman in her selfless mood.
  And touching fame, howe'er ye scorn my song,
  Take one verse more--the lady speaks it--this:

     '"My name, once mine, now thine, is closelier mine,
  For fame, could fame be mine, that fame were thine,
  And shame, could shame be thine, that shame were mine.
  So trust me not at all or all in all."

     'Says she not well? and there is more--this rhyme
  Is like the fair pearl-necklace of the Queen,
  That burst in dancing, and the pearls were spilt;
  Some lost, some stolen, some as relics kept.
  But nevermore the same two sister pearls
  Ran down the silken thread to kiss each other
  On her white neck--so is it with this rhyme:
  It lives dispersedly in many hands,
  And every minstrel sings it differently;
  Yet is there one true line, the pearl of pearls:
  "Man dreams of Fame while woman wakes to love."
  Yea!  Love, though Love were of the grossest, carves
  A portion from the solid present, eats
  And uses, careless of the rest; but Fame,
  The Fame that follows death is nothing to us;
  And what is Fame in life but half-disfame,
  And counterchanged with darkness? ye yourself
  Know well that Envy calls you Devil's son,
  And since ye seem the Master of all Art,
  They fain would make you Master of all vice.'

     And Merlin locked his hand in hers and said,
  'I once was looking for a magic weed,
  And found a fair young squire who sat alone,
  Had carved himself a knightly shield of wood,
  And then was painting on it fancied arms,
  Azure, an Eagle rising or, the Sun
  In dexter chief; the scroll "I follow fame."
  And speaking not, but leaning over him
  I took his brush and blotted out the bird,
  And made a Gardener putting in a graff,
  With this for motto, "Rather use than fame."
  You should have seen him blush; but afterwards
  He made a stalwart knight.  O Vivien,
  For you, methinks you think you love me well;
  For me, I love you somewhat; rest:  and Love
  Should have some rest and pleasure in himself,
  Not ever be too curious for a boon,
  Too prurient for a proof against the grain
  Of him ye say ye love:  but Fame with men,
  Being but ampler means to serve mankind,
  Should have small rest or pleasure in herself,
  But work as vassal to the larger love,
  That dwarfs the petty love of one to one.
  Use gave me Fame at first, and Fame again
  Increasing gave me use.  Lo, there my boon!
  What other? for men sought to prove me vile,
  Because I fain had given them greater wits:
  And then did Envy call me Devil's son:
  The sick weak beast seeking to help herself
  By striking at her better, missed, and brought
  Her own claw back, and wounded her own heart.
  Sweet were the days when I was all unknown,
  But when my name was lifted up, the storm
  Brake on the mountain and I cared not for it.
  Right well know I that Fame is half-disfame,
  Yet needs must work my work.  That other fame,
  To one at least, who hath not children, vague,
  The cackle of the unborn about the grave,
  I cared not for it:  a single misty star,
  Which is the second in a line of stars
  That seem a sword beneath a belt of three,
  I never gazed upon it but I dreamt
  Of some vast charm concluded in that star
  To make fame nothing.  Wherefore, if I fear,
  Giving you power upon me through this charm,
  That you might play me falsely, having power,
  However well ye think ye love me now
  (As sons of kings loving in pupilage
  Have turned to tyrants when they came to power)
  I rather dread the loss of use than fame;
  If you--and not so much from wickedness,
  As some wild turn of anger, or a mood
  Of overstrained affection, it may be,
  To keep me all to your own self,--or else
  A sudden spurt of woman's jealousy,--
  Should try this charm on whom ye say ye love.'

     And Vivien answered smiling as in wrath:
  'Have I not sworn?  I am not trusted.  Good!
  Well, hide it, hide it; I shall find it out;
  And being found take heed of Vivien.
  A woman and not trusted, doubtless I
  Might feel some sudden turn of anger born
  Of your misfaith; and your fine epithet
  Is accurate too, for this full love of mine
  Without the full heart back may merit well
  Your term of overstrained.  So used as I,
  My daily wonder is, I love at all.
  And as to woman's jealousy, O why not?
  O to what end, except a jealous one,
  And one to make me jealous if I love,
  Was this fair charm invented by yourself?
  I well believe that all about this world
  Ye cage a buxom captive here and there,
  Closed in the four walls of a hollow tower
  From which is no escape for evermore.'

     Then the great Master merrily answered her:
  'Full many a love in loving youth was mine;
  I needed then no charm to keep them mine
  But youth and love; and that full heart of yours
  Whereof ye prattle, may now assure you mine;
  So live uncharmed.  For those who wrought it first,
  The wrist is parted from the hand that waved,
  The feet unmortised from their ankle-bones
  Who paced it, ages back:  but will ye hear
  The legend as in guerdon for your rhyme?

     'There lived a king in the most Eastern East,
  Less old than I, yet older, for my blood
  Hath earnest in it of far springs to be.
  A tawny pirate anchored in his port,
  Whose bark had plundered twenty nameless isles;
  And passing one, at the high peep of dawn,
  He saw two cities in a thousand boats
  All fighting for a woman on the sea.
  And pushing his black craft among them all,
  He lightly scattered theirs and brought her off,
  With loss of half his people arrow-slain;
  A maid so smooth, so white, so wonderful,
  They said a light came from her when she moved:
  And since the pirate would not yield her up,
  The King impaled him for his piracy;
  Then made her Queen:  but those isle-nurtured eyes
  Waged such unwilling though successful war
  On all the youth, they sickened; councils thinned,
  And armies waned, for magnet-like she drew
  The rustiest iron of old fighters' hearts;
  And beasts themselves would worship; camels knelt
  Unbidden, and the brutes of mountain back
  That carry kings in castles, bowed black knees
  Of homage, ringing with their serpent hands,
  To make her smile, her golden ankle-bells.
  What wonder, being jealous, that he sent
  His horns of proclamation out through all
  The hundred under-kingdoms that he swayed
  To find a wizard who might teach the King
  Some charm, which being wrought upon the Queen
  Might keep her all his own:  to such a one
  He promised more than ever king has given,
  A league of mountain full of golden mines,
  A province with a hundred miles of coast,
  A palace and a princess, all for him:
  But on all those who tried and failed, the King
  Pronounced a dismal sentence, meaning by it
  To keep the list low and pretenders back,
  Or like a king, not to be trifled with--
  Their heads should moulder on the city gates.
  And many tried and failed, because the charm
  Of nature in her overbore their own:
  And many a wizard brow bleached on the walls:
  And many weeks a troop of carrion crows
  Hung like a cloud above the gateway towers.'

     And Vivien breaking in upon him, said:
  'I sit and gather honey; yet, methinks,
  Thy tongue has tript a little:  ask thyself.
  The lady never made unwilling war
  With those fine eyes:  she had her pleasure in it,
  And made her good man jealous with good cause.
  And lived there neither dame nor damsel then
  Wroth at a lover's loss? were all as tame,
  I mean, as noble, as the Queen was fair?
  Not one to flirt a venom at her eyes,
  Or pinch a murderous dust into her drink,
  Or make her paler with a poisoned rose?
  Well, those were not our days:  but did they find
  A wizard?  Tell me, was he like to thee?

     She ceased, and made her lithe arm round his neck
  Tighten, and then drew back, and let her eyes
  Speak for her, glowing on him, like a bride's
  On her new lord, her own, the first of men.

     He answered laughing, 'Nay, not like to me.
  At last they found--his foragers for charms--
  A little glassy-headed hairless man,
  Who lived alone in a great wild on grass;
  Read but one book, and ever reading grew
  So grated down and filed away with thought,
  So lean his eyes were monstrous; while the skin
  Clung but to crate and basket, ribs and spine.
  And since he kept his mind on one sole aim,
  Nor ever touched fierce wine, nor tasted flesh,
  Nor owned a sensual wish, to him the wall
  That sunders ghosts and shadow-casting men
  Became a crystal, and he saw them through it,
  And heard their voices talk behind the wall,
  And learnt their elemental secrets, powers
  And forces; often o'er the sun's bright eye
  Drew the vast eyelid of an inky cloud,
  And lashed it at the base with slanting storm;
  Or in the noon of mist and driving rain,
  When the lake whitened and the pinewood roared,
  And the cairned mountain was a shadow, sunned
  The world to peace again:  here was the man.
  And so by force they dragged him to the King.
  And then he taught the King to charm the Queen
  In such-wise, that no man could see her more,
  Nor saw she save the King, who wrought the charm,
  Coming and going, and she lay as dead,
  And lost all use of life:  but when the King
  Made proffer of the league of golden mines,
  The province with a hundred miles of coast,
  The palace and the princess, that old man
  Went back to his old wild, and lived on grass,
  And vanished, and his book came down to me.'

     And Vivien answered smiling saucily:
  'Ye have the book:  the charm is written in it:
  Good:  take my counsel:  let me know it at once:
  For keep it like a puzzle chest in chest,
  With each chest locked and padlocked thirty-fold,
  And whelm all this beneath as vast a mound
  As after furious battle turfs the slain
  On some wild down above the windy deep,
  I yet should strike upon a sudden means
  To dig, pick, open, find and read the charm:
  Then, if I tried it, who should blame me then?'

     And smiling as a master smiles at one
  That is not of his school, nor any school
  But that where blind and naked Ignorance
  Delivers brawling judgments, unashamed,
  On all things all day long, he answered her:

     'Thou read the book, my pretty Vivien!
  O ay, it is but twenty pages long,
  But every page having an ample marge,
  And every marge enclosing in the midst
  A square of text that looks a little blot,
  The text no larger than the limbs of fleas;
  And every square of text an awful charm,
  Writ in a language that has long gone by.
  So long, that mountains have arisen since
  With cities on their flanks--thou read the book!
  And ever margin scribbled, crost, and crammed
  With comment, densest condensation, hard
  To mind and eye; but the long sleepless nights
  Of my long life have made it easy to me.
  And none can read the text, not even I;
  And none can read the comment but myself;
  And in the comment did I find the charm.
  O, the results are simple; a mere child
  Might use it to the harm of anyone,
  And never could undo it:  ask no more:
  For though you should not prove it upon me,
  But keep that oath ye sware, ye might, perchance,
  Assay it on some one of the Table Round,
  And all because ye dream they babble of you.'

     And Vivien, frowning in true anger, said:
  'What dare the full-fed liars say of me?
  They ride abroad redressing human wrongs!
  They sit with knife in meat and wine in horn!
  They bound to holy vows of chastity!
  Were I not woman, I could tell a tale.
  But you are man, you well can understand
  The shame that cannot be explained for shame.
  Not one of all the drove should touch me:  swine!'

     Then answered Merlin careless of her words:
  'You breathe but accusation vast and vague,
  Spleen-born, I think, and proofless.  If ye know,
  Set up the charge ye know, to stand or fall!'

     And Vivien answered frowning wrathfully:
  'O ay, what say ye to Sir Valence, him
  Whose kinsman left him watcher o'er his wife
  And two fair babes, and went to distant lands;
  Was one year gone, and on returning found
  Not two but three? there lay the reckling, one
  But one hour old!  What said the happy sire?'
  A seven-months' babe had been a truer gift.
  Those twelve sweet moons confused his fatherhood.'

     Then answered Merlin, 'Nay, I know the tale.
  Sir Valence wedded with an outland dame:
  Some cause had kept him sundered from his wife:
  One child they had:  it lived with her:  she died:
  His kinsman travelling on his own affair
  Was charged by Valence to bring home the child.
  He brought, not found it therefore:  take the truth.'

     'O ay,' said Vivien, 'overtrue a tale.
  What say ye then to sweet Sir Sagramore,
  That ardent man? "to pluck the flower in season,"
  So says the song, "I trow it is no treason."
  O Master, shall we call him overquick
  To crop his own sweet rose before the hour?'

     And Merlin answered, 'Overquick art thou
  To catch a loathly plume fallen from the wing
  Of that foul bird of rapine whose whole prey
  Is man's good name:  he never wronged his bride.
  I know the tale.  An angry gust of wind
  Puffed out his torch among the myriad-roomed
  And many-corridored complexities
  Of Arthur's palace:  then he found a door,
  And darkling felt the sculptured ornament
  That wreathen round it made it seem his own;
  And wearied out made for the couch and slept,
  A stainless man beside a stainless maid;
  And either slept, nor knew of other there;
  Till the high dawn piercing the royal rose
  In Arthur's casement glimmered chastely down,
  Blushing upon them blushing, and at once
  He rose without a word and parted from her:
  But when the thing was blazed about the court,
  The brute world howling forced them into bonds,
  And as it chanced they are happy, being pure.'

     'O ay,' said Vivien, 'that were likely too.
  What say ye then to fair Sir Percivale
  And of the horrid foulness that he wrought,
  The saintly youth, the spotless lamb of Christ,
  Or some black wether of St Satan's fold.
  What, in the precincts of the chapel-yard,
  Among the knightly brasses of the graves,
  And by the cold Hic Jacets of the dead!'

     And Merlin answered careless of her charge,
  'A sober man is Percivale and pure;
  But once in life was flustered with new wine,
  Then paced for coolness in the chapel-yard;
  Where one of Satan's shepherdesses caught
  And meant to stamp him with her master's mark;
  And that he sinned is not believable;
  For, look upon his face!--but if he sinned,
  The sin that practice burns into the blood,
  And not the one dark hour which brings remorse,
  Will brand us, after, of whose fold we be:
  Or else were he, the holy king, whose hymns
  Are chanted in the minster, worse than all.
  But is your spleen frothed out, or have ye more?'

     And Vivien answered frowning yet in wrath:
  'O ay; what say ye to Sir Lancelot, friend
  Traitor or true? that commerce with the Queen,
  I ask you, is it clamoured by the child,
  Or whispered in the corner? do ye know it?'

     To which he answered sadly, 'Yea, I know it.
  Sir Lancelot went ambassador, at first,
  To fetch her, and she watched him from her walls.
  A rumour runs, she took him for the King,
  So fixt her fancy on him:  let them be.
  But have ye no one word of loyal praise
  For Arthur, blameless King and stainless man?'

     She answered with a low and chuckling laugh:
  'Man! is he man at all, who knows and winks?
  Sees what his fair bride is and does, and winks?
  By which the good King means to blind himself,
  And blinds himself and all the Table Round
  To all the foulness that they work.  Myself
  Could call him (were it not for womanhood)
  The pretty, popular cause such manhood earns,
  Could call him the main cause of all their crime;
  Yea, were he not crowned King, coward, and fool.'

     Then Merlin to his own heart, loathing, said:
  'O true and tender!  O my liege and King!
  O selfless man and stainless gentleman,
  Who wouldst against thine own eye-witness fain
  Have all men true and leal, all women pure;
  How, in the mouths of base interpreters,
  From over-fineness not intelligible
  To things with every sense as false and foul
  As the poached filth that floods the middle street,
  Is thy white blamelessness accounted blame!'

     But Vivien, deeming Merlin overborne
  By instance, recommenced, and let her tongue
  Rage like a fire among the noblest names,
  Polluting, and imputing her whole self,
  Defaming and defacing, till she left
  Not even Lancelot brave, nor Galahad clean.

     Her words had issue other than she willed.
  He dragged his eyebrow bushes down, and made
  A snowy penthouse for his hollow eyes,
  And muttered in himself, 'Tell her the charm!
  So, if she had it, would she rail on me
  To snare the next, and if she have it not
  So will she rail.  What did the wanton say?
  "Not mount as high;" we scarce can sink as low:
  For men at most differ as Heaven and earth,
  But women, worst and best, as Heaven and Hell.
  I know the Table Round, my friends of old;
  All brave, and many generous, and some chaste.
  She cloaks the scar of some repulse with lies;
  I well believe she tempted them and failed,
  Being so bitter:  for fine plots may fail,
  Though harlots paint their talk as well as face
  With colours of the heart that are not theirs.
  I will not let her know:  nine tithes of times
  Face-flatterer and backbiter are the same.
  And they, sweet soul, that most impute a crime
  Are pronest to it, and impute themselves,
  Wanting the mental range; or low desire
  Not to feel lowest makes them level all;
  Yea, they would pare the mountain to the plain,
  To leave an equal baseness; and in this
  Are harlots like the crowd, that if they find
  Some stain or blemish in a name of note,
  Not grieving that their greatest are so small,
  Inflate themselves with some insane delight,
  And judge all nature from her feet of clay,
  Without the will to lift their eyes, and see
  Her godlike head crowned with spiritual fire,
  And touching other worlds.  I am weary of her.'

     He spoke in words part heard, in whispers part,
  Half-suffocated in the hoary fell
  And many-wintered fleece of throat and chin.
  But Vivien, gathering somewhat of his mood,
  And hearing 'harlot' muttered twice or thrice,
  Leapt from her session on his lap, and stood
  Stiff as a viper frozen; loathsome sight,
  How from the rosy lips of life and love,
  Flashed the bare-grinning skeleton of death!
  White was her cheek; sharp breaths of anger puffed
  Her fairy nostril out; her hand half-clenched
  Went faltering sideways downward to her belt,
  And feeling; had she found a dagger there
  (For in a wink the false love turns to hate)
  She would have stabbed him; but she found it not:
  His eye was calm, and suddenly she took
  To bitter weeping like a beaten child,
  A long, long weeping, not consolable.
  Then her false voice made way, broken with sobs:

     'O crueller than was ever told in tale,
  Or sung in song!  O vainly lavished love!
  O cruel, there was nothing wild or strange,
  Or seeming shameful--for what shame in love,
  So love be true, and not as yours is--nothing
  Poor Vivien had not done to win his trust
  Who called her what he called her--all her crime,
  All--all--the wish to prove him wholly hers.'

     She mused a little, and then clapt her hands
  Together with a wailing shriek, and said:
  'Stabbed through the heart's affections to the heart!
  Seethed like the kid in its own mother's milk!
  Killed with a word worse than a life of blows!
  I thought that he was gentle, being great:
  O God, that I had loved a smaller man!
  I should have found in him a greater heart.
  O, I, that flattering my true passion, saw
  The knights, the court, the King, dark in your light,
  Who loved to make men darker than they are,
  Because of that high pleasure which I had
  To seat you sole upon my pedestal
  Of worship--I am answered, and henceforth
  The course of life that seemed so flowery to me
  With you for guide and master, only you,
  Becomes the sea-cliff pathway broken short,
  And ending in a ruin--nothing left,
  But into some low cave to crawl, and there,
  If the wolf spare me, weep my life away,
  Killed with inutterable unkindliness.'

     She paused, she turned away, she hung her head,
  The snake of gold slid from her hair, the braid
  Slipt and uncoiled itself, she wept afresh,
  And the dark wood grew darker toward the storm
  In silence, while his anger slowly died
  Within him, till he let his wisdom go
  For ease of heart, and half believed her true:
  Called her to shelter in the hollow oak,
  'Come from the storm,' and having no reply,
  Gazed at the heaving shoulder, and the face
  Hand-hidden, as for utmost grief or shame;
  Then thrice essayed, by tenderest-touching terms,
  To sleek her ruffled peace of mind, in vain.
  At last she let herself be conquered by him,
  And as the cageling newly flown returns,
  The seeming-injured simple-hearted thing
  Came to her old perch back, and settled there.
  There while she sat, half-falling from his knees,
  Half-nestled at his heart, and since he saw
  The slow tear creep from her closed eyelid yet,
  About her, more in kindness than in love,
  The gentle wizard cast a shielding arm.
  But she dislinked herself at once and rose,
  Her arms upon her breast across, and stood,
  A virtuous gentlewoman deeply wronged,
  Upright and flushed before him:  then she said:

     'There must now be no passages of love
  Betwixt us twain henceforward evermore;
  Since, if I be what I am grossly called,
  What should be granted which your own gross heart
  Would reckon worth the taking?  I will go.
  In truth, but one thing now--better have died
  Thrice than have asked it once--could make me stay--
  That proof of trust--so often asked in vain!
  How justly, after that vile term of yours,
  I find with grief!  I might believe you then,
  Who knows? once more.  Lo! what was once to me
  Mere matter of the fancy, now hath grown
  The vast necessity of heart and life.
  Farewell; think gently of me, for I fear
  My fate or folly, passing gayer youth
  For one so old, must be to love thee still.
  But ere I leave thee let me swear once more
  That if I schemed against thy peace in this,
  May yon just heaven, that darkens o'er me, send
  One flash, that, missing all things else, may make
  My scheming brain a cinder, if I lie.'

     Scarce had she ceased, when out of heaven a bolt
  (For now the storm was close above them) struck,
  Furrowing a giant oak, and javelining
  With darted spikes and splinters of the wood
  The dark earth round.  He raised his eyes and saw
  The tree that shone white-listed through the gloom.
  But Vivien, fearing heaven had heard her oath,
  And dazzled by the livid-flickering fork,
  And deafened with the stammering cracks and claps
  That followed, flying back and crying out,
  'O Merlin, though you do not love me, save,
  Yet save me!' clung to him and hugged him close;
  And called him dear protector in her fright,
  Nor yet forgot her practice in her fright,
  But wrought upon his mood and hugged him close.
  The pale blood of the wizard at her touch
  Took gayer colours, like an opal warmed.
  She blamed herself for telling hearsay tales:
  She shook from fear, and for her fault she wept
  Of petulancy; she called him lord and liege,
  Her seer, her bard, her silver star of eve,
  Her God, her Merlin, the one passionate love
  Of her whole life; and ever overhead
  Bellowed the tempest, and the rotten branch
  Snapt in the rushing of the river-rain
  Above them; and in change of glare and gloom
  Her eyes and neck glittering went and came;
  Till now the storm, its burst of passion spent,
  Moaning and calling out of other lands,
  Had left the ravaged woodland yet once more
  To peace; and what should not have been had been,
  For Merlin, overtalked and overworn,
  Had yielded, told her all the charm, and slept.

     Then, in one moment, she put forth the charm
  Of woven paces and of waving hands,
  And in the hollow oak he lay as dead,
  And lost to life and use and name and fame.

     Then crying 'I have made his glory mine,'
  And shrieking out 'O fool!' the harlot leapt
  Adown the forest, and the thicket closed
  Behind her, and the forest echoed 'fool.'



  Lancelot and Elaine

  Elaine the fair, Elaine the loveable,
  Elaine, the lily maid of Astolat,
  High in her chamber up a tower to the east
  Guarded the sacred shield of Lancelot;
  Which first she placed where the morning's earliest ray
  Might strike it, and awake her with the gleam;
  Then fearing rust or soilure fashioned for it
  A case of silk, and braided thereupon
  All the devices blazoned on the shield
  In their own tinct, and added, of her wit,
  A border fantasy of branch and flower,
  And yellow-throated nestling in the nest.
  Nor rested thus content, but day by day,
  Leaving her household and good father, climbed
  That eastern tower, and entering barred her door,
  Stript off the case, and read the naked shield,
  Now guessed a hidden meaning in his arms,
  Now made a pretty history to herself
  Of every dint a sword had beaten in it,
  And every scratch a lance had made upon it,
  Conjecturing when and where:  this cut is fresh;
  That ten years back; this dealt him at Caerlyle;
  That at Caerleon; this at Camelot:
  And ah God's mercy, what a stroke was there!
  And here a thrust that might have killed, but God
  Broke the strong lance, and rolled his enemy down,
  And saved him:  so she lived in fantasy.

     How came the lily maid by that good shield
  Of Lancelot, she that knew not even his name?
  He left it with her, when he rode to tilt
  For the great diamond in the diamond jousts,
  Which Arthur had ordained, and by that name
  Had named them, since a diamond was the prize.

     For Arthur, long before they crowned him King,
  Roving the trackless realms of Lyonnesse,
  Had found a glen, gray boulder and black tarn.
  A horror lived about the tarn, and clave
  Like its own mists to all the mountain side:
  For here two brothers, one a king, had met
  And fought together; but their names were lost;
  And each had slain his brother at a blow;
  And down they fell and made the glen abhorred:
  And there they lay till all their bones were bleached,
  And lichened into colour with the crags:
  And he, that once was king, had on a crown
  Of diamonds, one in front, and four aside.
  And Arthur came, and labouring up the pass,
  All in a misty moonshine, unawares
  Had trodden that crowned skeleton, and the skull
  Brake from the nape, and from the skull the crown
  Rolled into light, and turning on its rims
  Fled like a glittering rivulet to the tarn:
  And down the shingly scaur he plunged, and caught,
  And set it on his head, and in his heart
  Heard murmurs, 'Lo, thou likewise shalt be King.'

     Thereafter, when a King, he had the gems
  Plucked from the crown, and showed them to his knights,
  Saying, 'These jewels, whereupon I chanced
  Divinely, are the kingdom's, not the King's--
  For public use:  henceforward let there be,
  Once every year, a joust for one of these:
  For so by nine years' proof we needs must learn
  Which is our mightiest, and ourselves shall grow
  In use of arms and manhood, till we drive
  The heathen, who, some say, shall rule the land
  Hereafter, which God hinder.'  Thus he spoke:
  And eight years past, eight jousts had been, and still
  Had Lancelot won the diamond of the year,
  With purpose to present them to the Queen,
  When all were won; but meaning all at once
  To snare her royal fancy with a boon
  Worth half her realm, had never spoken word.

     Now for the central diamond and the last
  And largest, Arthur, holding then his court
  Hard on the river nigh the place which now
  Is this world's hugest, let proclaim a joust
  At Camelot, and when the time drew nigh
  Spake (for she had been sick) to Guinevere,
  'Are you so sick, my Queen, you cannot move
  To these fair jousts?'  'Yea, lord,' she said, 'ye know it.'
  'Then will ye miss,' he answered, 'the great deeds
  Of Lancelot, and his prowess in the lists,
  A sight ye love to look on.'  And the Queen
  Lifted her eyes, and they dwelt languidly
  On Lancelot, where he stood beside the King.
  He thinking that he read her meaning there,
  'Stay with me, I am sick; my love is more
  Than many diamonds,' yielded; and a heart
  Love-loyal to the least wish of the Queen
  (However much he yearned to make complete
  The tale of diamonds for his destined boon)
  Urged him to speak against the truth, and say,
  'Sir King, mine ancient wound is hardly whole,
  And lets me from the saddle;' and the King
  Glanced first at him, then her, and went his way.
  No sooner gone than suddenly she began:

     'To blame, my lord Sir Lancelot, much to blame!
  Why go ye not to these fair jousts? the knights
  Are half of them our enemies, and the crowd
  Will murmur, "Lo the shameless ones, who take
  Their pastime now the trustful King is gone!"'
  Then Lancelot vext at having lied in vain:
  'Are ye so wise? ye were not once so wise,
  My Queen, that summer, when ye loved me first.
  Then of the crowd ye took no more account
  Than of the myriad cricket of the mead,
  When its own voice clings to each blade of grass,
  And every voice is nothing.  As to knights,
  Them surely can I silence with all ease.
  But now my loyal worship is allowed
  Of all men:  many a bard, without offence,
  Has linked our names together in his lay,
  Lancelot, the flower of bravery, Guinevere,
  The pearl of beauty:  and our knights at feast
  Have pledged us in this union, while the King
  Would listen smiling.  How then? is there more?
  Has Arthur spoken aught? or would yourself,
  Now weary of my service and devoir,
  Henceforth be truer to your faultless lord?'

     She broke into a little scornful laugh:
  'Arthur, my lord, Arthur, the faultless King,
  That passionate perfection, my good lord--
  But who can gaze upon the Sun in heaven?
  He never spake word of reproach to me,
  He never had a glimpse of mine untruth,
  He cares not for me:  only here today
  There gleamed a vague suspicion in his eyes:
  Some meddling rogue has tampered with him--else
  Rapt in this fancy of his Table Round,
  And swearing men to vows impossible,
  To make them like himself:  but, friend, to me
  He is all fault who hath no fault at all:
  For who loves me must have a touch of earth;
  The low sun makes the colour:  I am yours,
  Not Arthur's, as ye know, save by the bond.
  And therefore hear my words:  go to the jousts:
  The tiny-trumpeting gnat can break our dream
  When sweetest; and the vermin voices here
  May buzz so loud--we scorn them, but they sting.'

     Then answered Lancelot, the chief of knights:
  'And with what face, after my pretext made,
  Shall I appear, O Queen, at Camelot, I
  Before a King who honours his own word,
  As if it were his God's?'

                           'Yea,' said the Queen,
  'A moral child without the craft to rule,
  Else had he not lost me:  but listen to me,
  If I must find you wit:  we hear it said
  That men go down before your spear at a touch,
  But knowing you are Lancelot; your great name,
  This conquers:  hide it therefore; go unknown:
  Win! by this kiss you will:  and our true King
  Will then allow your pretext, O my knight,
  As all for glory; for to speak him true,
  Ye know right well, how meek soe'er he seem,
  No keener hunter after glory breathes.
  He loves it in his knights more than himself:
  They prove to him his work:  win and return.'

     Then got Sir Lancelot suddenly to horse,
  Wroth at himself.  Not willing to be known,
  He left the barren-beaten thoroughfare,
  Chose the green path that showed the rarer foot,
  And there among the solitary downs,
  Full often lost in fancy, lost his way;
  Till as he traced a faintly-shadowed track,
  That all in loops and links among the dales
  Ran to the Castle of Astolat, he saw
  Fired from the west, far on a hill, the towers.
  Thither he made, and blew the gateway horn.
  Then came an old, dumb, myriad-wrinkled man,
  Who let him into lodging and disarmed.
  And Lancelot marvelled at the wordless man;
  And issuing found the Lord of Astolat
  With two strong sons, Sir Torre and Sir Lavaine,
  Moving to meet him in the castle court;
  And close behind them stept the lily maid
  Elaine, his daughter:  mother of the house
  There was not:  some light jest among them rose
  With laughter dying down as the great knight
  Approached them:  then the Lord of Astolat:
  'Whence comes thou, my guest, and by what name
  Livest thou between the lips? for by thy state
  And presence I might guess thee chief of those,
  After the King, who eat in Arthur's halls.
  Him have I seen:  the rest, his Table Round,
  Known as they are, to me they are unknown.'

     Then answered Sir Lancelot, the chief of knights:
  'Known am I, and of Arthur's hall, and known,
  What I by mere mischance have brought, my shield.
  But since I go to joust as one unknown
  At Camelot for the diamond, ask me not,
  Hereafter ye shall know me--and the shield--
  I pray you lend me one, if such you have,
  Blank, or at least with some device not mine.'

     Then said the Lord of Astolat, 'Here is Torre's:
  Hurt in his first tilt was my son, Sir Torre.
  And so, God wot, his shield is blank enough.
  His ye can have.'  Then added plain Sir Torre,
  'Yea, since I cannot use it, ye may have it.'
  Here laughed the father saying, 'Fie, Sir Churl,
  Is that answer for a noble knight?
  Allow him! but Lavaine, my younger here,
  He is so full of lustihood, he will ride,
  Joust for it, and win, and bring it in an hour,
  And set it in this damsel's golden hair,
  To make her thrice as wilful as before.'

     'Nay, father, nay good father, shame me not
  Before this noble knight,' said young Lavaine,
  'For nothing.  Surely I but played on Torre:
  He seemed so sullen, vext he could not go:
  A jest, no more! for, knight, the maiden dreamt
  That some one put this diamond in her hand,
  And that it was too slippery to be held,
  And slipt and fell into some pool or stream,
  The castle-well, belike; and then I said
  That if I went and if I fought and won it
  (But all was jest and joke among ourselves)
  Then must she keep it safelier.  All was jest.
  But, father, give me leave, an if he will,
  To ride to Camelot with this noble knight:
  Win shall I not, but do my best to win:
  Young as I am, yet would I do my best.'

     'So will ye grace me,' answered Lancelot,
  Smiling a moment, 'with your fellowship
  O'er these waste downs whereon I lost myself,
  Then were I glad of you as guide and friend:
  And you shall win this diamond,--as I hear
  It is a fair large diamond,--if ye may,
  And yield it to this maiden, if ye will.'
  'A fair large diamond,' added plain Sir Torre,
  'Such be for queens, and not for simple maids.'
  Then she, who held her eyes upon the ground,
  Elaine, and heard her name so tost about,
  Flushed slightly at the slight disparagement
  Before the stranger knight, who, looking at her,
  Full courtly, yet not falsely, thus returned:
  'If what is fair be but for what is fair,
  And only queens are to be counted so,
  Rash were my judgment then, who deem this maid
  Might wear as fair a jewel as is on earth,
  Not violating the bond of like to like.'

     He spoke and ceased:  the lily maid Elaine,
  Won by the mellow voice before she looked,
  Lifted her eyes, and read his lineaments.
  The great and guilty love he bare the Queen,
  In battle with the love he bare his lord,
  Had marred his face, and marked it ere his time.
  Another sinning on such heights with one,
  The flower of all the west and all the world,
  Had been the sleeker for it:  but in him
  His mood was often like a fiend, and rose
  And drove him into wastes and solitudes
  For agony, who was yet a living soul.
  Marred as he was, he seemed the goodliest man
  That ever among ladies ate in hall,
  And noblest, when she lifted up her eyes.
  However marred, of more than twice her years,
  Seamed with an ancient swordcut on the cheek,
  And bruised and bronzed, she lifted up her eyes
  And loved him, with that love which was her doom.

     Then the great knight, the darling of the court,
  Loved of the loveliest, into that rude hall
  Stept with all grace, and not with half disdain
  Hid under grace, as in a smaller time,
  But kindly man moving among his kind:
  Whom they with meats and vintage of their best
  And talk and minstrel melody entertained.
  And much they asked of court and Table Round,
  And ever well and readily answered he:
  But Lancelot, when they glanced at Guinevere,
  Suddenly speaking of the wordless man,
  Heard from the Baron that, ten years before,
  The heathen caught and reft him of his tongue.
  'He learnt and warned me of their fierce design
  Against my house, and him they caught and maimed;
  But I, my sons, and little daughter fled
  From bonds or death, and dwelt among the woods
  By the great river in a boatman's hut.
  Dull days were those, till our good Arthur broke
  The Pagan yet once more on Badon hill.'

     'O there, great lord, doubtless,' Lavaine said, rapt
  By all the sweet and sudden passion of youth
  Toward greatness in its elder, 'you have fought.
  O tell us--for we live apart--you know
  Of Arthur's glorious wars.'  And Lancelot spoke
  And answered him at full, as having been
  With Arthur in the fight which all day long
  Rang by the white mouth of the violent Glem;
  And in the four loud battles by the shore
  Of Duglas; that on Bassa; then the war
  That thundered in and out the gloomy skirts
  Of Celidon the forest; and again
  By castle Gurnion, where the glorious King
  Had on his cuirass worn our Lady's Head,
  Carved of one emerald centered in a sun
  Of silver rays, that lightened as he breathed;
  And at Caerleon had he helped his lord,
  When the strong neighings of the wild white Horse
  Set every gilded parapet shuddering;
  And up in Agned-Cathregonion too,
  And down the waste sand-shores of Trath Treroit,
  Where many a heathen fell; 'and on the mount
  Of Badon I myself beheld the King
  Charge at the head of all his Table Round,
  And all his legions crying Christ and him,
  And break them; and I saw him, after, stand
  High on a heap of slain, from spur to plume
  Red as the rising sun with heathen blood,
  And seeing me, with a great voice he cried,
  "They are broken, they are broken!" for the King,
  However mild he seems at home, nor cares
  For triumph in our mimic wars, the jousts--
  For if his own knight cast him down, he laughs
  Saying, his knights are better men than he--
  Yet in this heathen war the fire of God
  Fills him:  I never saw his like:  there lives
  No greater leader.'

                     While he uttered this,
  Low to her own heart said the lily maid,
  'Save your own great self, fair lord;' and when he fell
  From talk of war to traits of pleasantry--
  Being mirthful he, but in a stately kind--
  She still took note that when the living smile
  Died from his lips, across him came a cloud
  Of melancholy severe, from which again,
  Whenever in her hovering to and fro
  The lily maid had striven to make him cheer,
  There brake a sudden-beaming tenderness
  Of manners and of nature:  and she thought
  That all was nature, all, perchance, for her.
  And all night long his face before her lived,
  As when a painter, poring on a face,
  Divinely through all hindrance finds the man
  Behind it, and so paints him that his face,
  The shape and colour of a mind and life,
  Lives for his children, ever at its best
  And fullest; so the face before her lived,
  Dark-splendid, speaking in the silence, full
  Of noble things, and held her from her sleep.
  Till rathe she rose, half-cheated in the thought
  She needs must bid farewell to sweet Lavaine.
  First in fear, step after step, she stole
  Down the long tower-stairs, hesitating:
  Anon, she heard Sir Lancelot cry in the court,
  'This shield, my friend, where is it?' and Lavaine
  Past inward, as she came from out the tower.
  There to his proud horse Lancelot turned, and smoothed
  The glossy shoulder, humming to himself.
  Half-envious of the flattering hand, she drew
  Nearer and stood.  He looked, and more amazed
  Than if seven men had set upon him, saw
  The maiden standing in the dewy light.
  He had not dreamed she was so beautiful.
  Then came on him a sort of sacred fear,
  For silent, though he greeted her, she stood
  Rapt on his face as if it were a God's.
  Suddenly flashed on her a wild desire,
  That he should wear her favour at the tilt.
  She braved a riotous heart in asking for it.
  'Fair lord, whose name I know not--noble it is,
  I well believe, the noblest--will you wear
  My favour at this tourney?'  'Nay,' said he,
  'Fair lady, since I never yet have worn
  Favour of any lady in the lists.
  Such is my wont, as those, who know me, know.'
  'Yea, so,' she answered; 'then in wearing mine
  Needs must be lesser likelihood, noble lord,
  That those who know should know you.'  And he turned
  Her counsel up and down within his mind,
  And found it true, and answered, 'True, my child.
  Well, I will wear it:  fetch it out to me:
  What is it?' and she told him 'A red sleeve
  Broidered with pearls,' and brought it:  then he bound
  Her token on his helmet, with a smile
  Saying, 'I never yet have done so much
  For any maiden living,' and the blood
  Sprang to her face and filled her with delight;
  But left her all the paler, when Lavaine
  Returning brought the yet-unblazoned shield,
  His brother's; which he gave to Lancelot,
  Who parted with his own to fair Elaine:
  'Do me this grace, my child, to have my shield
  In keeping till I come.'  'A grace to me,'
  She answered, 'twice today.  I am your squire!'
  Whereat Lavaine said, laughing, 'Lily maid,
  For fear our people call you lily maid
  In earnest, let me bring your colour back;
  Once, twice, and thrice:  now get you hence to bed:'
  So kissed her, and Sir Lancelot his own hand,
  And thus they moved away:  she stayed a minute,
  Then made a sudden step to the gate, and there--
  Her bright hair blown about the serious face
  Yet rosy-kindled with her brother's kiss--
  Paused by the gateway, standing near the shield
  In silence, while she watched their arms far-off
  Sparkle, until they dipt below the downs.
  Then to her tower she climbed, and took the shield,
  There kept it, and so lived in fantasy.

     Meanwhile the new companions past away
  Far o'er the long backs of the bushless downs,
  To where Sir Lancelot knew there lived a knight
  Not far from Camelot, now for forty years
  A hermit, who had prayed, laboured and prayed,
  And ever labouring had scooped himself
  In the white rock a chapel and a hall
  On massive columns, like a shorecliff cave,
  And cells and chambers:  all were fair and dry;
  The green light from the meadows underneath
  Struck up and lived along the milky roofs;
  And in the meadows tremulous aspen-trees
  And poplars made a noise of falling showers.
  And thither wending there that night they bode.

     But when the next day broke from underground,
  And shot red fire and shadows through the cave,
  They rose, heard mass, broke fast, and rode away:
  Then Lancelot saying, 'Hear, but hold my name
  Hidden, you ride with Lancelot of the Lake,'
  Abashed young Lavaine, whose instant reverence,
  Dearer to true young hearts than their own praise,
  But left him leave to stammer, 'Is it indeed?'
  And after muttering 'The great Lancelot,
  At last he got his breath and answered, 'One,
  One have I seen--that other, our liege lord,
  The dread Pendragon, Britain's King of kings,
  Of whom the people talk mysteriously,
  He will be there--then were I stricken blind
  That minute, I might say that I had seen.'

     So spake Lavaine, and when they reached the lists
  By Camelot in the meadow, let his eyes
  Run through the peopled gallery which half round
  Lay like a rainbow fallen upon the grass,
  Until they found the clear-faced King, who sat
  Robed in red samite, easily to be known,
  Since to his crown the golden dragon clung,
  And down his robe the dragon writhed in gold,
  And from the carven-work behind him crept
  Two dragons gilded, sloping down to make
  Arms for his chair, while all the rest of them
  Through knots and loops and folds innumerable
  Fled ever through the woodwork, till they found
  The new design wherein they lost themselves,
  Yet with all ease, so tender was the work:
  And, in the costly canopy o'er him set,
  Blazed the last diamond of the nameless king.

     Then Lancelot answered young Lavaine and said,
  'Me you call great:  mine is the firmer seat,
  The truer lance:  but there is many a youth
  Now crescent, who will come to all I am
  And overcome it; and in me there dwells
  No greatness, save it be some far-off touch
  Of greatness to know well I am not great:
  There is the man.'  And Lavaine gaped upon him
  As on a thing miraculous, and anon
  The trumpets blew; and then did either side,
  They that assailed, and they that held the lists,
  Set lance in rest, strike spur, suddenly move,
  Meet in the midst, and there so furiously
  Shock, that a man far-off might well perceive,
  If any man that day were left afield,
  The hard earth shake, and a low thunder of arms.
  And Lancelot bode a little, till he saw
  Which were the weaker; then he hurled into it
  Against the stronger:  little need to speak
  Of Lancelot in his glory!  King, duke, earl,
  Count, baron--whom he smote, he overthrew.

     But in the field were Lancelot's kith and kin,
  Ranged with the Table Round that held the lists,
  Strong men, and wrathful that a stranger knight
  Should do and almost overdo the deeds
  Of Lancelot; and one said to the other, 'Lo!
  What is he?  I do not mean the force alone--
  The grace and versatility of the man!
  Is it not Lancelot?'  'When has Lancelot worn
  Favour of any lady in the lists?
  Not such his wont, as we, that know him, know.'
  'How then? who then?' a fury seized them all,
  A fiery family passion for the name
  Of Lancelot, and a glory one with theirs.
  They couched their spears and pricked their steeds, and thus,
  Their plumes driven backward by the wind they made
  In moving, all together down upon him
  Bare, as a wild wave in the wide North-sea,
  Green-glimmering toward the summit, bears, with all
  Its stormy crests that smoke against the skies,
  Down on a bark, and overbears the bark,
  And him that helms it, so they overbore
  Sir Lancelot and his charger, and a spear
  Down-glancing lamed the charger, and a spear
  Pricked sharply his own cuirass, and the head
  Pierced through his side, and there snapt, and remained.

     Then Sir Lavaine did well and worshipfully;
  He bore a knight of old repute to the earth,
  And brought his horse to Lancelot where he lay.
  He up the side, sweating with agony, got,
  But thought to do while he might yet endure,
  And being lustily holpen by the rest,
  His party,--though it seemed half-miracle
  To those he fought with,--drave his kith and kin,
  And all the Table Round that held the lists,
  Back to the barrier; then the trumpets blew
  Proclaiming his the prize, who wore the sleeve
  Of scarlet, and the pearls; and all the knights,
  His party, cried 'Advance and take thy prize
  The diamond;' but he answered, 'Diamond me
  No diamonds! for God's love, a little air!
  Prize me no prizes, for my prize is death!
  Hence will I, and I charge you, follow me not.'

     He spoke, and vanished suddenly from the field
  With young Lavaine into the poplar grove.
  There from his charger down he slid, and sat,
  Gasping to Sir Lavaine, 'Draw the lance-head:'
  'Ah my sweet lord Sir Lancelot,' said Lavaine,
  'I dread me, if I draw it, you will die.'
  But he, 'I die already with it:  draw--
  Draw,'--and Lavaine drew, and Sir Lancelot gave
  A marvellous great shriek and ghastly groan,
  And half his blood burst forth, and down he sank
  For the pure pain, and wholly swooned away.
  Then came the hermit out and bare him in,
  There stanched his wound; and there, in daily doubt
  Whether to live or die, for many a week
  Hid from the wide world's rumour by the grove
  Of poplars with their noise of falling showers,
  And ever-tremulous aspen-trees, he lay.

     But on that day when Lancelot fled the lists,
  His party, knights of utmost North and West,
  Lords of waste marches, kings of desolate isles,
  Came round their great Pendragon, saying to him,
  'Lo, Sire, our knight, through whom we won the day,
  Hath gone sore wounded, and hath left his prize
  Untaken, crying that his prize is death.'
  'Heaven hinder,' said the King, 'that such an one,
  So great a knight as we have seen today--
  He seemed to me another Lancelot--
  Yea, twenty times I thought him Lancelot--
  He must not pass uncared for.  Wherefore, rise,
  O Gawain, and ride forth and find the knight.
  Wounded and wearied needs must he be near.
  I charge you that you get at once to horse.
  And, knights and kings, there breathes not one of you
  Will deem this prize of ours is rashly given:
  His prowess was too wondrous.  We will do him
  No customary honour:  since the knight
  Came not to us, of us to claim the prize,
  Ourselves will send it after.  Rise and take
  This diamond, and deliver it, and return,
  And bring us where he is, and how he fares,
  And cease not from your quest until ye find.'

     So saying, from the carven flower above,
  To which it made a restless heart, he took,
  And gave, the diamond:  then from where he sat
  At Arthur's right, with smiling face arose,
  With smiling face and frowning heart, a Prince
  In the mid might and flourish of his May,
  Gawain, surnamed The Courteous, fair and strong,
  And after Lancelot, Tristram, and Geraint
  And Gareth, a good knight, but therewithal
  Sir Modred's brother, and the child of Lot,
  Nor often loyal to his word, and now
  Wroth that the King's command to sally forth
  In quest of whom he knew not, made him leave
  The banquet, and concourse of knights and kings.

     So all in wrath he got to horse and went;
  While Arthur to the banquet, dark in mood,
  Past, thinking 'Is it Lancelot who hath come
  Despite the wound he spake of, all for gain
  Of glory, and hath added wound to wound,
  And ridden away to die?'  So feared the King,
  And, after two days' tarriance there, returned.
  Then when he saw the Queen, embracing asked,
  'Love, are you yet so sick?'  'Nay, lord,' she said.
  'And where is Lancelot?'  Then the Queen amazed,
  'Was he not with you? won he not your prize?'
  'Nay, but one like him.'  'Why that like was he.'
  And when the King demanded how she knew,
  Said, 'Lord, no sooner had ye parted from us,
  Than Lancelot told me of a common talk
  That men went down before his spear at a touch,
  But knowing he was Lancelot; his great name
  Conquered; and therefore would he hide his name
  From all men, even the King, and to this end
  Had made a pretext of a hindering wound,
  That he might joust unknown of all, and learn
  If his old prowess were in aught decayed;
  And added, "Our true Arthur, when he learns,
  Will well allow me pretext, as for gain
  Of purer glory."'

                   Then replied the King:
  'Far lovelier in our Lancelot had it been,
  In lieu of idly dallying with the truth,
  To have trusted me as he hath trusted thee.
  Surely his King and most familiar friend
  Might well have kept his secret.  True, indeed,
  Albeit I know my knights fantastical,
  So fine a fear in our large Lancelot
  Must needs have moved my laughter:  now remains
  But little cause for laughter:  his own kin--
  Ill news, my Queen, for all who love him, this!--
  His kith and kin, not knowing, set upon him;
  So that he went sore wounded from the field:
  Yet good news too:  for goodly hopes are mine
  That Lancelot is no more a lonely heart.
  He wore, against his wont, upon his helm
  A sleeve of scarlet, broidered with great pearls,
  Some gentle maiden's gift.'

                             'Yea, lord,' she said,
  'Thy hopes are mine,' and saying that, she choked,
  And sharply turned about to hide her face,
  Past to her chamber, and there flung herself
  Down on the great King's couch, and writhed upon it,
  And clenched her fingers till they bit the palm,
  And shrieked out 'Traitor' to the unhearing wall,
  Then flashed into wild tears, and rose again,
  And moved about her palace, proud and pale.

     Gawain the while through all the region round
  Rode with his diamond, wearied of the quest,
  Touched at all points, except the poplar grove,
  And came at last, though late, to Astolat:
  Whom glittering in enamelled arms the maid
  Glanced at, and cried, 'What news from Camelot, lord?
  What of the knight with the red sleeve?'  'He won.'
  'I knew it,' she said.  'But parted from the jousts
  Hurt in the side,' whereat she caught her breath;
  Through her own side she felt the sharp lance go;
  Thereon she smote her hand:  wellnigh she swooned:
  And, while he gazed wonderingly at her, came
  The Lord of Astolat out, to whom the Prince
  Reported who he was, and on what quest
  Sent, that he bore the prize and could not find
  The victor, but had ridden a random round
  To seek him, and had wearied of the search.
  To whom the Lord of Astolat, 'Bide with us,
  And ride no more at random, noble Prince!
  Here was the knight, and here he left a shield;
  This will he send or come for:  furthermore
  Our son is with him; we shall hear anon,
  Needs must hear.'  To this the courteous Prince
  Accorded with his wonted courtesy,
  Courtesy with a touch of traitor in it,
  And stayed; and cast his eyes on fair Elaine:
  Where could be found face daintier? then her shape
  From forehead down to foot, perfect--again
  From foot to forehead exquisitely turned:
  'Well--if I bide, lo! this wild flower for me!'
  And oft they met among the garden yews,
  And there he set himself to play upon her
  With sallying wit, free flashes from a height
  Above her, graces of the court, and songs,
  Sighs, and slow smiles, and golden eloquence
  And amorous adulation, till the maid
  Rebelled against it, saying to him, 'Prince,
  O loyal nephew of our noble King,
  Why ask you not to see the shield he left,
  Whence you might learn his name?  Why slight your King,
  And lose the quest he sent you on, and prove
  No surer than our falcon yesterday,
  Who lost the hern we slipt her at, and went
  To all the winds?'  'Nay, by mine head,' said he,
  'I lose it, as we lose the lark in heaven,
  O damsel, in the light of your blue eyes;
  But an ye will it let me see the shield.'
  And when the shield was brought, and Gawain saw
  Sir Lancelot's azure lions, crowned with gold,
  Ramp in the field, he smote his thigh, and mocked:
  'Right was the King! our Lancelot! that true man!'
  'And right was I,' she answered merrily, 'I,
  Who dreamed my knight the greatest knight of all.'
  'And if I dreamed,' said Gawain, 'that you love
  This greatest knight, your pardon! lo, ye know it!
  Speak therefore:  shall I waste myself in vain?'
  Full simple was her answer, 'What know I?
  My brethren have been all my fellowship;
  And I, when often they have talked of love,
  Wished it had been my mother, for they talked,
  Meseemed, of what they knew not; so myself--
  I know not if I know what true love is,
  But if I know, then, if I love not him,
  I know there is none other I can love.'
  'Yea, by God's death,' said he, 'ye love him well,
  But would not, knew ye what all others know,
  And whom he loves.'  'So be it,' cried Elaine,
  And lifted her fair face and moved away:
  But he pursued her, calling, 'Stay a little!
  One golden minute's grace! he wore your sleeve:
  Would he break faith with one I may not name?
  Must our true man change like a leaf at last?
  Nay--like enow:  why then, far be it from me
  To cross our mighty Lancelot in his loves!
  And, damsel, for I deem you know full well
  Where your great knight is hidden, let me leave
  My quest with you; the diamond also:  here!
  For if you love, it will be sweet to give it;
  And if he love, it will be sweet to have it
  From your own hand; and whether he love or not,
  A diamond is a diamond.  Fare you well
  A thousand times!--a thousand times farewell!
  Yet, if he love, and his love hold, we two
  May meet at court hereafter:  there, I think,
  So ye will learn the courtesies of the court,
  We two shall know each other.'

                                Then he gave,
  And slightly kissed the hand to which he gave,
  The diamond, and all wearied of the quest
  Leapt on his horse, and carolling as he went
  A true-love ballad, lightly rode away.

     Thence to the court he past; there told the King
  What the King knew, 'Sir Lancelot is the knight.'
  And added, 'Sire, my liege, so much I learnt;
  But failed to find him, though I rode all round
  The region:  but I lighted on the maid
  Whose sleeve he wore; she loves him; and to her,
  Deeming our courtesy is the truest law,
  I gave the diamond:  she will render it;
  For by mine head she knows his hiding-place.'

     The seldom-frowning King frowned, and replied,
  'Too courteous truly! ye shall go no more
  On quest of mine, seeing that ye forget
  Obedience is the courtesy due to kings.'

     He spake and parted.  Wroth, but all in awe,
  For twenty strokes of the blood, without a word,
  Lingered that other, staring after him;
  Then shook his hair, strode off, and buzzed abroad
  About the maid of Astolat, and her love.
  All ears were pricked at once, all tongues were loosed:
  'The maid of Astolat loves Sir Lancelot,
  Sir Lancelot loves the maid of Astolat.'
  Some read the King's face, some the Queen's, and all
  Had marvel what the maid might be, but most
  Predoomed her as unworthy.  One old dame
  Came suddenly on the Queen with the sharp news.
  She, that had heard the noise of it before,
  But sorrowing Lancelot should have stooped so low,
  Marred her friend's aim with pale tranquillity.
  So ran the tale like fire about the court,
  Fire in dry stubble a nine-days' wonder flared:
  Till even the knights at banquet twice or thrice
  Forgot to drink to Lancelot and the Queen,
  And pledging Lancelot and the lily maid
  Smiled at each other, while the Queen, who sat
  With lips severely placid, felt the knot
  Climb in her throat, and with her feet unseen
  Crushed the wild passion out against the floor
  Beneath the banquet, where all the meats became
  As wormwood, and she hated all who pledged.

     But far away the maid in Astolat,
  Her guiltless rival, she that ever kept
  The one-day-seen Sir Lancelot in her heart,
  Crept to her father, while he mused alone,
  Sat on his knee, stroked his gray face and said,
  'Father, you call me wilful, and the fault
  Is yours who let me have my will, and now,
  Sweet father, will you let me lose my wits?'
  'Nay,' said he, 'surely.'  'Wherefore, let me hence,'
  She answered, 'and find out our dear Lavaine.'
  'Ye will not lose your wits for dear Lavaine:
  Bide,' answered he:  'we needs must hear anon
  Of him, and of that other.'  'Ay,' she said,
  'And of that other, for I needs must hence
  And find that other, wheresoe'er he be,
  And with mine own hand give his diamond to him,
  Lest I be found as faithless in the quest
  As yon proud Prince who left the quest to me.
  Sweet father, I behold him in my dreams
  Gaunt as it were the skeleton of himself,
  Death-pale, for lack of gentle maiden's aid.
  The gentler-born the maiden, the more bound,
  My father, to be sweet and serviceable
  To noble knights in sickness, as ye know
  When these have worn their tokens:  let me hence
  I pray you.'  Then her father nodding said,
  'Ay, ay, the diamond:  wit ye well, my child,
  Right fain were I to learn this knight were whole,
  Being our greatest:  yea, and you must give it--
  And sure I think this fruit is hung too high
  For any mouth to gape for save a queen's--
  Nay, I mean nothing:  so then, get you gone,
  Being so very wilful you must go.'

     Lightly, her suit allowed, she slipt away,
  And while she made her ready for her ride,
  Her father's latest word hummed in her ear,
  'Being so very wilful you must go,'
  And changed itself and echoed in her heart,
  'Being so very wilful you must die.'
  But she was happy enough and shook it off,
  As we shake off the bee that buzzes at us;
  And in her heart she answered it and said,
  'What matter, so I help him back to life?'
  Then far away with good Sir Torre for guide
  Rode o'er the long backs of the bushless downs
  To Camelot, and before the city-gates
  Came on her brother with a happy face
  Making a roan horse caper and curvet
  For pleasure all about a field of flowers:
  Whom when she saw, 'Lavaine,' she cried, 'Lavaine,
  How fares my lord Sir Lancelot?'  He amazed,
  'Torre and Elaine! why here? Sir Lancelot!
  How know ye my lord's name is Lancelot?'
  But when the maid had told him all her tale,
  Then turned Sir Torre, and being in his moods
  Left them, and under the strange-statued gate,
  Where Arthur's wars were rendered mystically,
  Past up the still rich city to his kin,
  His own far blood, which dwelt at Camelot;
  And her, Lavaine across the poplar grove
  Led to the caves:  there first she saw the casque
  Of Lancelot on the wall:  her scarlet sleeve,
  Though carved and cut, and half the pearls away,
  Streamed from it still; and in her heart she laughed,
  Because he had not loosed it from his helm,
  But meant once more perchance to tourney in it.
  And when they gained the cell wherein he slept,
  His battle-writhen arms and mighty hands
  Lay naked on the wolfskin, and a dream
  Of dragging down his enemy made them move.
  Then she that saw him lying unsleek, unshorn,
  Gaunt as it were the skeleton of himself,
  Uttered a little tender dolorous cry.
  The sound not wonted in a place so still
  Woke the sick knight, and while he rolled his eyes
  Yet blank from sleep, she started to him, saying,
  'Your prize the diamond sent you by the King:'
  His eyes glistened:  she fancied 'Is it for me?'
  And when the maid had told him all the tale
  Of King and Prince, the diamond sent, the quest
  Assigned to her not worthy of it, she knelt
  Full lowly by the corners of his bed,
  And laid the diamond in his open hand.
  Her face was near, and as we kiss the child
  That does the task assigned, he kissed her face.
  At once she slipt like water to the floor.
  'Alas,' he said, 'your ride hath wearied you.
  Rest must you have.'  'No rest for me,' she said;
  'Nay, for near you, fair lord, I am at rest.'
  What might she mean by that? his large black eyes,
  Yet larger through his leanness, dwelt upon her,
  Till all her heart's sad secret blazed itself
  In the heart's colours on her simple face;
  And Lancelot looked and was perplext in mind,
  And being weak in body said no more;
  But did not love the colour; woman's love,
  Save one, he not regarded, and so turned
  Sighing, and feigned a sleep until he slept.

     Then rose Elaine and glided through the fields,
  And past beneath the weirdly-sculptured gates
  Far up the dim rich city to her kin;
  There bode the night:  but woke with dawn, and past
  Down through the dim rich city to the fields,
  Thence to the cave:  so day by day she past
  In either twilight ghost-like to and fro
  Gliding, and every day she tended him,
  And likewise many a night:  and Lancelot
  Would, though he called his wound a little hurt
  Whereof he should be quickly whole, at times
  Brain-feverous in his heat and agony, seem
  Uncourteous, even he:  but the meek maid
  Sweetly forbore him ever, being to him
  Meeker than any child to a rough nurse,
  Milder than any mother to a sick child,
  And never woman yet, since man's first fall,
  Did kindlier unto man, but her deep love
  Upbore her; till the hermit, skilled in all
  The simples and the science of that time,
  Told him that her fine care had saved his life.
  And the sick man forgot her simple blush,
  Would call her friend and sister, sweet Elaine,
  Would listen for her coming and regret
  Her parting step, and held her tenderly,
  And loved her with all love except the love
  Of man and woman when they love their best,
  Closest and sweetest, and had died the death
  In any knightly fashion for her sake.
  And peradventure had he seen her first
  She might have made this and that other world
  Another world for the sick man; but now
  The shackles of an old love straitened him,
  His honour rooted in dishonour stood,
  And faith unfaithful kept him falsely true.

     Yet the great knight in his mid-sickness made
  Full many a holy vow and pure resolve.
  These, as but born of sickness, could not live:
  For when the blood ran lustier in him again,
  Full often the bright image of one face,
  Making a treacherous quiet in his heart,
  Dispersed his resolution like a cloud.
  Then if the maiden, while that ghostly grace
  Beamed on his fancy, spoke, he answered not,
  Or short and coldly, and she knew right well
  What the rough sickness meant, but what this meant
  She knew not, and the sorrow dimmed her sight,
  And drave her ere her time across the fields
  Far into the rich city, where alone
  She murmured, 'Vain, in vain:  it cannot be.
  He will not love me:  how then? must I die?'
  Then as a little helpless innocent bird,
  That has but one plain passage of few notes,
  Will sing the simple passage o'er and o'er
  For all an April morning, till the ear
  Wearies to hear it, so the simple maid
  Went half the night repeating, 'Must I die?'
  And now to right she turned, and now to left,
  And found no ease in turning or in rest;
  And 'Him or death,' she muttered, 'death or him,'
  Again and like a burthen, 'Him or death.'

     But when Sir Lancelot's deadly hurt was whole,
  To Astolat returning rode the three.
  There morn by morn, arraying her sweet self
  In that wherein she deemed she looked her best,
  She came before Sir Lancelot, for she thought
  'If I be loved, these are my festal robes,
  If not, the victim's flowers before he fall.'
  And Lancelot ever prest upon the maid
  That she should ask some goodly gift of him
  For her own self or hers; 'and do not shun
  To speak the wish most near to your true heart;
  Such service have ye done me, that I make
  My will of yours, and Prince and Lord am I
  In mine own land, and what I will I can.'
  Then like a ghost she lifted up her face,
  But like a ghost without the power to speak.
  And Lancelot saw that she withheld her wish,
  And bode among them yet a little space
  Till he should learn it; and one morn it chanced
  He found her in among the garden yews,
  And said, 'Delay no longer, speak your wish,
  Seeing I go today:' then out she brake:
  'Going? and we shall never see you more.
  And I must die for want of one bold word.'
  'Speak:  that I live to hear,' he said, 'is yours.'
  Then suddenly and passionately she spoke:
  'I have gone mad.  I love you:  let me die.'
  'Ah, sister,' answered Lancelot, 'what is this?'
  And innocently extending her white arms,
  'Your love,' she said, 'your love--to be your wife.'
  And Lancelot answered, 'Had I chosen to wed,
  I had been wedded earlier, sweet Elaine:
  But now there never will be wife of mine.'
  'No, no,' she cried, 'I care not to be wife,
  But to be with you still, to see your face,
  To serve you, and to follow you through the world.'
  And Lancelot answered, 'Nay, the world, the world,
  All ear and eye, with such a stupid heart
  To interpret ear and eye, and such a tongue
  To blare its own interpretation--nay,
  Full ill then should I quit your brother's love,
  And your good father's kindness.'  And she said,
  'Not to be with you, not to see your face--
  Alas for me then, my good days are done.'
  'Nay, noble maid,' he answered, 'ten times nay!
  This is not love:  but love's first flash in youth,
  Most common:  yea, I know it of mine own self:
  And you yourself will smile at your own self
  Hereafter, when you yield your flower of life
  To one more fitly yours, not thrice your age:
  And then will I, for true you are and sweet
  Beyond mine old belief in womanhood,
  More specially should your good knight be poor,
  Endow you with broad land and territory
  Even to the half my realm beyond the seas,
  So that would make you happy:  furthermore,
  Even to the death, as though ye were my blood,
  In all your quarrels will I be your knight.
  This I will do, dear damsel, for your sake,
  And more than this I cannot.'

                               While he spoke
  She neither blushed nor shook, but deathly-pale
  Stood grasping what was nearest, then replied:
  'Of all this will I nothing;' and so fell,
  And thus they bore her swooning to her tower.

     Then spake, to whom through those black walls of yew
  Their talk had pierced, her father:  'Ay, a flash,
  I fear me, that will strike my blossom dead.
  Too courteous are ye, fair Lord Lancelot.
  I pray you, use some rough discourtesy
  To blunt or break her passion.'

                                 Lancelot said,
  'That were against me:  what I can I will;'
  And there that day remained, and toward even
  Sent for his shield:  full meekly rose the maid,
  Stript off the case, and gave the naked shield;
  Then, when she heard his horse upon the stones,
  Unclasping flung the casement back, and looked
  Down on his helm, from which her sleeve had gone.
  And Lancelot knew the little clinking sound;
  And she by tact of love was well aware
  That Lancelot knew that she was looking at him.
  And yet he glanced not up, nor waved his hand,
  Nor bad farewell, but sadly rode away.
  This was the one discourtesy that he used.

     So in her tower alone the maiden sat:
  His very shield was gone; only the case,
  Her own poor work, her empty labour, left.
  But still she heard him, still his picture formed
  And grew between her and the pictured wall.
  Then came her father, saying in low tones,
  'Have comfort,' whom she greeted quietly.
  Then came her brethren saying, 'Peace to thee,
  Sweet sister,' whom she answered with all calm.
  But when they left her to herself again,
  Death, like a friend's voice from a distant field
  Approaching through the darkness, called; the owls
  Wailing had power upon her, and she mixt
  Her fancies with the sallow-rifted glooms
  Of evening, and the moanings of the wind.

     And in those days she made a little song,
  And called her song 'The Song of Love and Death,'
  And sang it:  sweetly could she make and sing.

     'Sweet is true love though given in vain, in vain;
  And sweet is death who puts an end to pain:
  I know not which is sweeter, no, not I.

     'Love, art thou sweet? then bitter death must be:
  Love, thou art bitter; sweet is death to me.
  O Love, if death be sweeter, let me die.

     'Sweet love, that seems not made to fade away,
  Sweet death, that seems to make us loveless clay,
  I know not which is sweeter, no, not I.

     'I fain would follow love, if that could be;
  I needs must follow death, who calls for me;
  Call and I follow, I follow! let me die.'

     High with the last line scaled her voice, and this,
  All in a fiery dawning wild with wind
  That shook her tower, the brothers heard, and thought
  With shuddering, 'Hark the Phantom of the house
  That ever shrieks before a death,' and called
  The father, and all three in hurry and fear
  Ran to her, and lo! the blood-red light of dawn
  Flared on her face, she shrilling, 'Let me die!'

     As when we dwell upon a word we know,
  Repeating, till the word we know so well
  Becomes a wonder, and we know not why,
  So dwelt the father on her face, and thought
  'Is this Elaine?' till back the maiden fell,
  Then gave a languid hand to each, and lay,
  Speaking a still good-morrow with her eyes.
  At last she said, 'Sweet brothers, yesternight
  I seemed a curious little maid again,
  As happy as when we dwelt among the woods,
  And when ye used to take me with the flood
  Up the great river in the boatman's boat.
  Only ye would not pass beyond the cape
  That has the poplar on it:  there ye fixt
  Your limit, oft returning with the tide.
  And yet I cried because ye would not pass
  Beyond it, and far up the shining flood
  Until we found the palace of the King.
  And yet ye would not; but this night I dreamed
  That I was all alone upon the flood,
  And then I said, "Now shall I have my will:"
  And there I woke, but still the wish remained.
  So let me hence that I may pass at last
  Beyond the poplar and far up the flood,
  Until I find the palace of the King.
  There will I enter in among them all,
  And no man there will dare to mock at me;
  But there the fine Gawain will wonder at me,
  And there the great Sir Lancelot muse at me;
  Gawain, who bad a thousand farewells to me,
  Lancelot, who coldly went, nor bad me one:
  And there the King will know me and my love,
  And there the Queen herself will pity me,
  And all the gentle court will welcome me,
  And after my long voyage I shall rest!'

     'Peace,' said her father, 'O my child, ye seem
  Light-headed, for what force is yours to go
  So far, being sick? and wherefore would ye look
  On this proud fellow again, who scorns us all?'

     Then the rough Torre began to heave and move,
  And bluster into stormy sobs and say,
  'I never loved him:  an I meet with him,
  I care not howsoever great he be,
  Then will I strike at him and strike him down,
  Give me good fortune, I will strike him dead,
  For this discomfort he hath done the house.'

     To whom the gentle sister made reply,
  'Fret not yourself, dear brother, nor be wroth,
  Seeing it is no more Sir Lancelot's fault
  Not to love me, than it is mine to love
  Him of all men who seems to me the highest.'

     'Highest?' the father answered, echoing 'highest?'
  (He meant to break the passion in her) 'nay,
  Daughter, I know not what you call the highest;
  But this I know, for all the people know it,
  He loves the Queen, and in an open shame:
  And she returns his love in open shame;
  If this be high, what is it to be low?'

     Then spake the lily maid of Astolat:
  'Sweet father, all too faint and sick am I
  For anger:  these are slanders:  never yet
  Was noble man but made ignoble talk.
  He makes no friend who never made a foe.
  But now it is my glory to have loved
  One peerless, without stain:  so let me pass,
  My father, howsoe'er I seem to you,
  Not all unhappy, having loved God's best
  And greatest, though my love had no return:
  Yet, seeing you desire your child to live,
  Thanks, but you work against your own desire;
  For if I could believe the things you say
  I should but die the sooner; wherefore cease,
  Sweet father, and bid call the ghostly man
  Hither, and let me shrive me clean, and die.'

     So when the ghostly man had come and gone,
  She with a face, bright as for sin forgiven,
  Besought Lavaine to write as she devised
  A letter, word for word; and when he asked
  'Is it for Lancelot, is it for my dear lord?
  Then will I bear it gladly;' she replied,
  'For Lancelot and the Queen and all the world,
  But I myself must bear it.'  Then he wrote
  The letter she devised; which being writ
  And folded, 'O sweet father, tender and true,
  Deny me not,' she said--'ye never yet
  Denied my fancies--this, however strange,
  My latest:  lay the letter in my hand
  A little ere I die, and close the hand
  Upon it; I shall guard it even in death.
  And when the heat is gone from out my heart,
  Then take the little bed on which I died
  For Lancelot's love, and deck it like the Queen's
  For richness, and me also like the Queen
  In all I have of rich, and lay me on it.
  And let there be prepared a chariot-bier
  To take me to the river, and a barge
  Be ready on the river, clothed in black.
  I go in state to court, to meet the Queen.
  There surely I shall speak for mine own self,
  And none of you can speak for me so well.
  And therefore let our dumb old man alone
  Go with me, he can steer and row, and he
  Will guide me to that palace, to the doors.'

     She ceased:  her father promised; whereupon
  She grew so cheerful that they deemed her death
  Was rather in the fantasy than the blood.
  But ten slow mornings past, and on the eleventh
  Her father laid the letter in her hand,
  And closed the hand upon it, and she died.
  So that day there was dole in Astolat.

     But when the next sun brake from underground,
  Then, those two brethren slowly with bent brows
  Accompanying, the sad chariot-bier
  Past like a shadow through the field, that shone
  Full-summer, to that stream whereon the barge,
  Palled all its length in blackest samite, lay.
  There sat the lifelong creature of the house,
  Loyal, the dumb old servitor, on deck,
  Winking his eyes, and twisted all his face.
  So those two brethren from the chariot took
  And on the black decks laid her in her bed,
  Set in her hand a lily, o'er her hung
  The silken case with braided blazonings,
  And kissed her quiet brows, and saying to her
  'Sister, farewell for ever,' and again
  'Farewell, sweet sister,' parted all in tears.
  Then rose the dumb old servitor, and the dead,
  Oared by the dumb, went upward with the flood--
  In her right hand the lily, in her left
  The letter--all her bright hair streaming down--
  And all the coverlid was cloth of gold
  Drawn to her waist, and she herself in white
  All but her face, and that clear-featured face
  Was lovely, for she did not seem as dead,
  But fast asleep, and lay as though she smiled.

     That day Sir Lancelot at the palace craved
  Audience of Guinevere, to give at last,
  The price of half a realm, his costly gift,
  Hard-won and hardly won with bruise and blow,
  With deaths of others, and almost his own,
  The nine-years-fought-for diamonds:  for he saw
  One of her house, and sent him to the Queen
  Bearing his wish, whereto the Queen agreed
  With such and so unmoved a majesty
  She might have seemed her statue, but that he,
  Low-drooping till he wellnigh kissed her feet
  For loyal awe, saw with a sidelong eye
  The shadow of some piece of pointed lace,
  In the Queen's shadow, vibrate on the walls,
  And parted, laughing in his courtly heart.

     All in an oriel on the summer side,
  Vine-clad, of Arthur's palace toward the stream,
  They met, and Lancelot kneeling uttered, 'Queen,
  Lady, my liege, in whom I have my joy,
  Take, what I had not won except for you,
  These jewels, and make me happy, making them
  An armlet for the roundest arm on earth,
  Or necklace for a neck to which the swan's
  Is tawnier than her cygnet's:  these are words:
  Your beauty is your beauty, and I sin
  In speaking, yet O grant my worship of it
  Words, as we grant grief tears.  Such sin in words
  Perchance, we both can pardon:  but, my Queen,
  I hear of rumours flying through your court.
  Our bond, as not the bond of man and wife,
  Should have in it an absoluter trust
  To make up that defect:  let rumours be:
  When did not rumours fly? these, as I trust
  That you trust me in your own nobleness,
  I may not well believe that you believe.'

     While thus he spoke, half turned away, the Queen
  Brake from the vast oriel-embowering vine
  Leaf after leaf, and tore, and cast them off,
  Till all the place whereon she stood was green;
  Then, when he ceased, in one cold passive hand
  Received at once and laid aside the gems
  There on a table near her, and replied:

     'It may be, I am quicker of belief
  Than you believe me, Lancelot of the Lake.
  Our bond is not the bond of man and wife.
  This good is in it, whatsoe'er of ill,
  It can be broken easier.  I for you
  This many a year have done despite and wrong
  To one whom ever in my heart of hearts
  I did acknowledge nobler.  What are these?
  Diamonds for me! they had been thrice their worth
  Being your gift, had you not lost your own.
  To loyal hearts the value of all gifts
  Must vary as the giver's.  Not for me!
  For her! for your new fancy.  Only this
  Grant me, I pray you:  have your joys apart.
  I doubt not that however changed, you keep
  So much of what is graceful:  and myself
  Would shun to break those bounds of courtesy
  In which as Arthur's Queen I move and rule:
  So cannot speak my mind.  An end to this!
  A strange one! yet I take it with Amen.
  So pray you, add my diamonds to her pearls;
  Deck her with these; tell her, she shines me down:
  An armlet for an arm to which the Queen's
  Is haggard, or a necklace for a neck
  O as much fairer--as a faith once fair
  Was richer than these diamonds--hers not mine--
  Nay, by the mother of our Lord himself,
  Or hers or mine, mine now to work my will--
  She shall not have them.'

                           Saying which she seized,
  And, through the casement standing wide for heat,
  Flung them, and down they flashed, and smote the stream.
  Then from the smitten surface flashed, as it were,
  Diamonds to meet them, and they past away.
  Then while Sir Lancelot leant, in half disdain
  At love, life, all things, on the window ledge,
  Close underneath his eyes, and right across
  Where these had fallen, slowly past the barge.
  Whereon the lily maid of Astolat
  Lay smiling, like a star in blackest night.

     But the wild Queen, who saw not, burst away
  To weep and wail in secret; and the barge,
  On to the palace-doorway sliding, paused.
  There two stood armed, and kept the door; to whom,
  All up the marble stair, tier over tier,
  Were added mouths that gaped, and eyes that asked
  'What is it?' but that oarsman's haggard face,
  As hard and still as is the face that men
  Shape to their fancy's eye from broken rocks
  On some cliff-side, appalled them, and they said
  'He is enchanted, cannot speak--and she,
  Look how she sleeps--the Fairy Queen, so fair!
  Yea, but how pale! what are they? flesh and blood?
  Or come to take the King to Fairyland?
  For some do hold our Arthur cannot die,
  But that he passes into Fairyland.'

     While thus they babbled of the King, the King
  Came girt with knights:  then turned the tongueless man
  From the half-face to the full eye, and rose
  And pointed to the damsel, and the doors.
  So Arthur bad the meek Sir Percivale
  And pure Sir Galahad to uplift the maid;
  And reverently they bore her into hall.
  Then came the fine Gawain and wondered at her,
  And Lancelot later came and mused at her,
  And last the Queen herself, and pitied her:
  But Arthur spied the letter in her hand,
  Stoopt, took, brake seal, and read it; this was all:

     'Most noble lord, Sir Lancelot of the Lake,
  I, sometime called the maid of Astolat,
  Come, for you left me taking no farewell,
  Hither, to take my last farewell of you.
  I loved you, and my love had no return,
  And therefore my true love has been my death.
  And therefore to our Lady Guinevere,
  And to all other ladies, I make moan:
  Pray for my soul, and yield me burial.
  Pray for my soul thou too, Sir Lancelot,
  As thou art a knight peerless.'

                                 Thus he read;
  And ever in the reading, lords and dames
  Wept, looking often from his face who read
  To hers which lay so silent, and at times,
  So touched were they, half-thinking that her lips,
  Who had devised the letter, moved again.

     Then freely spoke Sir Lancelot to them all:
  'My lord liege Arthur, and all ye that hear,
  Know that for this most gentle maiden's death
  Right heavy am I; for good she was and true,
  But loved me with a love beyond all love
  In women, whomsoever I have known.
  Yet to be loved makes not to love again;
  Not at my years, however it hold in youth.
  I swear by truth and knighthood that I gave
  No cause, not willingly, for such a love:
  To this I call my friends in testimony,
  Her brethren, and her father, who himself
  Besought me to be plain and blunt, and use,
  To break her passion, some discourtesy
  Against my nature:  what I could, I did.
  I left her and I bad her no farewell;
  Though, had I dreamt the damsel would have died,
  I might have put my wits to some rough use,
  And helped her from herself.'

                               Then said the Queen
  (Sea was her wrath, yet working after storm)
  'Ye might at least have done her so much grace,
  Fair lord, as would have helped her from her death.'
  He raised his head, their eyes met and hers fell,
  He adding,
            'Queen, she would not be content
  Save that I wedded her, which could not be.
  Then might she follow me through the world, she asked;
  It could not be.  I told her that her love
  Was but the flash of youth, would darken down
  To rise hereafter in a stiller flame
  Toward one more worthy of her--then would I,
  More specially were he, she wedded, poor,
  Estate them with large land and territory
  In mine own realm beyond the narrow seas,
  To keep them in all joyance:  more than this
  I could not; this she would not, and she died.'

     He pausing, Arthur answered, 'O my knight,
  It will be to thy worship, as my knight,
  And mine, as head of all our Table Round,
  To see that she be buried worshipfully.'

     So toward that shrine which then in all the realm
  Was richest, Arthur leading, slowly went
  The marshalled Order of their Table Round,
  And Lancelot sad beyond his wont, to see
  The maiden buried, not as one unknown,
  Nor meanly, but with gorgeous obsequies,
  And mass, and rolling music, like a queen.
  And when the knights had laid her comely head
  Low in the dust of half-forgotten kings,
  Then Arthur spake among them, 'Let her tomb
  Be costly, and her image thereupon,
  And let the shield of Lancelot at her feet
  Be carven, and her lily in her hand.
  And let the story of her dolorous voyage
  For all true hearts be blazoned on her tomb
  In letters gold and azure!' which was wrought
  Thereafter; but when now the lords and dames
  And people, from the high door streaming, brake
  Disorderly, as homeward each, the Queen,
  Who marked Sir Lancelot where he moved apart,
  Drew near, and sighed in passing, 'Lancelot,
  Forgive me; mine was jealousy in love.'
  He answered with his eyes upon the ground,
  'That is love's curse; pass on, my Queen, forgiven.'
  But Arthur, who beheld his cloudy brows,
  Approached him, and with full affection said,

     'Lancelot, my Lancelot, thou in whom I have
  Most joy and most affiance, for I know
  What thou hast been in battle by my side,
  And many a time have watched thee at the tilt
  Strike down the lusty and long practised knight,
  And let the younger and unskilled go by
  To win his honour and to make his name,
  And loved thy courtesies and thee, a man
  Made to be loved; but now I would to God,
  Seeing the homeless trouble in thine eyes,
  Thou couldst have loved this maiden, shaped, it seems,
  By God for thee alone, and from her face,
  If one may judge the living by the dead,
  Delicately pure and marvellously fair,
  Who might have brought thee, now a lonely man
  Wifeless and heirless, noble issue, sons
  Born to the glory of thine name and fame,
  My knight, the great Sir Lancelot of the Lake.'

     Then answered Lancelot, 'Fair she was, my King,
  Pure, as you ever wish your knights to be.
  To doubt her fairness were to want an eye,
  To doubt her pureness were to want a heart--
  Yea, to be loved, if what is worthy love
  Could bind him, but free love will not be bound.'

     'Free love, so bound, were freest,' said the King.
  'Let love be free; free love is for the best:
  And, after heaven, on our dull side of death,
  What should be best, if not so pure a love
  Clothed in so pure a loveliness? yet thee
  She failed to bind, though being, as I think,
  Unbound as yet, and gentle, as I know.'

     And Lancelot answered nothing, but he went,
  And at the inrunning of a little brook
  Sat by the river in a cove, and watched
  The high reed wave, and lifted up his eyes
  And saw the barge that brought her moving down,
  Far-off, a blot upon the stream, and said
  Low in himself, 'Ah simple heart and sweet,
  Ye loved me, damsel, surely with a love
  Far tenderer than my Queen's.  Pray for thy soul?
  Ay, that will I.  Farewell too--now at last--
  Farewell, fair lily.  "Jealousy in love?"
  Not rather dead love's harsh heir, jealous pride?
  Queen, if I grant the jealousy as of love,
  May not your crescent fear for name and fame
  Speak, as it waxes, of a love that wanes?
  Why did the King dwell on my name to me?
  Mine own name shames me, seeming a reproach,
  Lancelot, whom the Lady of the Lake
  Caught from his mother's arms--the wondrous one
  Who passes through the vision of the night--
  She chanted snatches of mysterious hymns
  Heard on the winding waters, eve and morn
  She kissed me saying, "Thou art fair, my child,
  As a king's son," and often in her arms
  She bare me, pacing on the dusky mere.
  Would she had drowned me in it, where'er it be!
  For what am I? what profits me my name
  Of greatest knight?  I fought for it, and have it:
  Pleasure to have it, none; to lose it, pain;
  Now grown a part of me:  but what use in it?
  To make men worse by making my sin known?
  Or sin seem less, the sinner seeming great?
  Alas for Arthur's greatest knight, a man
  Not after Arthur's heart!  I needs must break
  These bonds that so defame me:  not without
  She wills it:  would I, if she willed it? nay,
  Who knows? but if I would not, then may God,
  I pray him, send a sudden Angel down
  To seize me by the hair and bear me far,
  And fling me deep in that forgotten mere,
  Among the tumbled fragments of the hills.'

     So groaned Sir Lancelot in remorseful pain,
  Not knowing he should die a holy man.



  The Holy Grail

  From noiseful arms, and acts of prowess done
  In tournament or tilt, Sir Percivale,
  Whom Arthur and his knighthood called The Pure,
  Had passed into the silent life of prayer,
  Praise, fast, and alms; and leaving for the cowl
  The helmet in an abbey far away
  From Camelot, there, and not long after, died.

     And one, a fellow-monk among the rest,
  Ambrosius, loved him much beyond the rest,
  And honoured him, and wrought into his heart
  A way by love that wakened love within,
  To answer that which came:  and as they sat
  Beneath a world-old yew-tree, darkening half
  The cloisters, on a gustful April morn
  That puffed the swaying branches into smoke
  Above them, ere the summer when he died
  The monk Ambrosius questioned Percivale:

     'O brother, I have seen this yew-tree smoke,
  Spring after spring, for half a hundred years:
  For never have I known the world without,
  Nor ever strayed beyond the pale:  but thee,
  When first thou camest--such a courtesy
  Spake through the limbs and in the voice--I knew
  For one of those who eat in Arthur's hall;
  For good ye are and bad, and like to coins,
  Some true, some light, but every one of you
  Stamped with the image of the King; and now
  Tell me, what drove thee from the Table Round,
  My brother? was it earthly passion crost?'

     'Nay,' said the knight; 'for no such passion mine.
  But the sweet vision of the Holy Grail
  Drove me from all vainglories, rivalries,
  And earthly heats that spring and sparkle out
  Among us in the jousts, while women watch
  Who wins, who falls; and waste the spiritual strength
  Within us, better offered up to Heaven.'

     To whom the monk:  'The Holy Grail!--I trust
  We are green in Heaven's eyes; but here too much
  We moulder--as to things without I mean--
  Yet one of your own knights, a guest of ours,
  Told us of this in our refectory,
  But spake with such a sadness and so low
  We heard not half of what he said.  What is it?
  The phantom of a cup that comes and goes?'

     'Nay, monk! what phantom?' answered Percivale.
  'The cup, the cup itself, from which our Lord
  Drank at the last sad supper with his own.
  This, from the blessed land of Aromat--
  After the day of darkness, when the dead
  Went wandering o'er Moriah--the good saint
  Arimathaean Joseph, journeying brought
  To Glastonbury, where the winter thorn
  Blossoms at Christmas, mindful of our Lord.
  And there awhile it bode; and if a man
  Could touch or see it, he was healed at once,
  By faith, of all his ills.  But then the times
  Grew to such evil that the holy cup
  Was caught away to Heaven, and disappeared.'

     To whom the monk:  'From our old books I know
  That Joseph came of old to Glastonbury,
  And there the heathen Prince, Arviragus,
  Gave him an isle of marsh whereon to build;
  And there he built with wattles from the marsh
  A little lonely church in days of yore,
  For so they say, these books of ours, but seem
  Mute of this miracle, far as I have read.
  But who first saw the holy thing today?'

     'A woman,' answered Percivale, 'a nun,
  And one no further off in blood from me
  Than sister; and if ever holy maid
  With knees of adoration wore the stone,
  A holy maid; though never maiden glowed,
  But that was in her earlier maidenhood,
  With such a fervent flame of human love,
  Which being rudely blunted, glanced and shot
  Only to holy things; to prayer and praise
  She gave herself, to fast and alms.  And yet,
  Nun as she was, the scandal of the Court,
  Sin against Arthur and the Table Round,
  And the strange sound of an adulterous race,
  Across the iron grating of her cell
  Beat, and she prayed and fasted all the more.

     'And he to whom she told her sins, or what
  Her all but utter whiteness held for sin,
  A man wellnigh a hundred winters old,
  Spake often with her of the Holy Grail,
  A legend handed down through five or six,
  And each of these a hundred winters old,
  From our Lord's time.  And when King Arthur made
  His Table Round, and all men's hearts became
  Clean for a season, surely he had thought
  That now the Holy Grail would come again;
  But sin broke out.  Ah, Christ, that it would come,
  And heal the world of all their wickedness!
  "O Father!" asked the maiden, "might it come
  To me by prayer and fasting?"  "Nay," said he,
  "I know not, for thy heart is pure as snow."
  And so she prayed and fasted, till the sun
  Shone, and the wind blew, through her, and I thought
  She might have risen and floated when I saw her.

     'For on a day she sent to speak with me.
  And when she came to speak, behold her eyes
  Beyond my knowing of them, beautiful,
  Beyond all knowing of them, wonderful,
  Beautiful in the light of holiness.
  And "O my brother Percivale," she said,
  "Sweet brother, I have seen the Holy Grail:
  For, waked at dead of night, I heard a sound
  As of a silver horn from o'er the hills
  Blown, and I thought, 'It is not Arthur's use
  To hunt by moonlight;' and the slender sound
  As from a distance beyond distance grew
  Coming upon me--O never harp nor horn,
  Nor aught we blow with breath, or touch with hand,
  Was like that music as it came; and then
  Streamed through my cell a cold and silver beam,
  And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail,
  Rose-red with beatings in it, as if alive,
  Till all the white walls of my cell were dyed
  With rosy colours leaping on the wall;
  And then the music faded, and the Grail
  Past, and the beam decayed, and from the walls
  The rosy quiverings died into the night.
  So now the Holy Thing is here again
  Among us, brother, fast thou too and pray,
  And tell thy brother knights to fast and pray,
  That so perchance the vision may be seen
  By thee and those, and all the world be healed."

     'Then leaving the pale nun, I spake of this
  To all men; and myself fasted and prayed
  Always, and many among us many a week
  Fasted and prayed even to the uttermost,
  Expectant of the wonder that would be.

     'And one there was among us, ever moved
  Among us in white armour, Galahad.
  "God make thee good as thou art beautiful,"
  Said Arthur, when he dubbed him knight; and none,
  In so young youth, was ever made a knight
  Till Galahad; and this Galahad, when he heard
  My sister's vision, filled me with amaze;
  His eyes became so like her own, they seemed
  Hers, and himself her brother more than I.

     'Sister or brother none had he; but some
  Called him a son of Lancelot, and some said
  Begotten by enchantment--chatterers they,
  Like birds of passage piping up and down,
  That gape for flies--we know not whence they come;
  For when was Lancelot wanderingly lewd?

     'But she, the wan sweet maiden, shore away
  Clean from her forehead all that wealth of hair
  Which made a silken mat-work for her feet;
  And out of this she plaited broad and long
  A strong sword-belt, and wove with silver thread
  And crimson in the belt a strange device,
  A crimson grail within a silver beam;
  And saw the bright boy-knight, and bound it on him,
  Saying, "My knight, my love, my knight of heaven,
  O thou, my love, whose love is one with mine,
  I, maiden, round thee, maiden, bind my belt.
  Go forth, for thou shalt see what I have seen,
  And break through all, till one will crown thee king
  Far in the spiritual city:" and as she spake
  She sent the deathless passion in her eyes
  Through him, and made him hers, and laid her mind
  On him, and he believed in her belief.

     'Then came a year of miracle:  O brother,
  In our great hall there stood a vacant chair,
  Fashioned by Merlin ere he past away,
  And carven with strange figures; and in and out
  The figures, like a serpent, ran a scroll
  Of letters in a tongue no man could read.
  And Merlin called it "The Siege perilous,"
  Perilous for good and ill; "for there," he said,
  "No man could sit but he should lose himself:"
  And once by misadvertence Merlin sat
  In his own chair, and so was lost; but he,
  Galahad, when he heard of Merlin's doom,
  Cried, "If I lose myself, I save myself!"

     'Then on a summer night it came to pass,
  While the great banquet lay along the hall,
  That Galahad would sit down in Merlin's chair.

     'And all at once, as there we sat, we heard
  A cracking and a riving of the roofs,
  And rending, and a blast, and overhead
  Thunder, and in the thunder was a cry.
  And in the blast there smote along the hall
  A beam of light seven times more clear than day:
  And down the long beam stole the Holy Grail
  All over covered with a luminous cloud.
  And none might see who bare it, and it past.
  But every knight beheld his fellow's face
  As in a glory, and all the knights arose,
  And staring each at other like dumb men
  Stood, till I found a voice and sware a vow.

     'I sware a vow before them all, that I,
  Because I had not seen the Grail, would ride
  A twelvemonth and a day in quest of it,
  Until I found and saw it, as the nun
  My sister saw it; and Galahad sware the vow,
  And good Sir Bors, our Lancelot's cousin, sware,
  And Lancelot sware, and many among the knights,
  And Gawain sware, and louder than the rest.'

     Then spake the monk Ambrosius, asking him,
  'What said the King?  Did Arthur take the vow?'

     'Nay, for my lord,' said Percivale, 'the King,
  Was not in hall:  for early that same day,
  Scaped through a cavern from a bandit hold,
  An outraged maiden sprang into the hall
  Crying on help:  for all her shining hair
  Was smeared with earth, and either milky arm
  Red-rent with hooks of bramble, and all she wore
  Torn as a sail that leaves the rope is torn
  In tempest:  so the King arose and went
  To smoke the scandalous hive of those wild bees
  That made such honey in his realm.  Howbeit
  Some little of this marvel he too saw,
  Returning o'er the plain that then began
  To darken under Camelot; whence the King
  Looked up, calling aloud, "Lo, there! the roofs
  Of our great hall are rolled in thunder-smoke!
  Pray Heaven, they be not smitten by the bolt."
  For dear to Arthur was that hall of ours,
  As having there so oft with all his knights
  Feasted, and as the stateliest under heaven.

     'O brother, had you known our mighty hall,
  Which Merlin built for Arthur long ago!
  For all the sacred mount of Camelot,
  And all the dim rich city, roof by roof,
  Tower after tower, spire beyond spire,
  By grove, and garden-lawn, and rushing brook,
  Climbs to the mighty hall that Merlin built.
  And four great zones of sculpture, set betwixt
  With many a mystic symbol, gird the hall:
  And in the lowest beasts are slaying men,
  And in the second men are slaying beasts,
  And on the third are warriors, perfect men,
  And on the fourth are men with growing wings,
  And over all one statue in the mould
  Of Arthur, made by Merlin, with a crown,
  And peaked wings pointed to the Northern Star.
  And eastward fronts the statue, and the crown
  And both the wings are made of gold, and flame
  At sunrise till the people in far fields,
  Wasted so often by the heathen hordes,
  Behold it, crying, "We have still a King."

     'And, brother, had you known our hall within,
  Broader and higher than any in all the lands!
  Where twelve great windows blazon Arthur's wars,
  And all the light that falls upon the board
  Streams through the twelve great battles of our King.
  Nay, one there is, and at the eastern end,
  Wealthy with wandering lines of mount and mere,
  Where Arthur finds the brand Excalibur.
  And also one to the west, and counter to it,
  And blank:  and who shall blazon it? when and how?--
  O there, perchance, when all our wars are done,
  The brand Excalibur will be cast away.

     'So to this hall full quickly rode the King,
  In horror lest the work by Merlin wrought,
  Dreamlike, should on the sudden vanish, wrapt
  In unremorseful folds of rolling fire.
  And in he rode, and up I glanced, and saw
  The golden dragon sparkling over all:
  And many of those who burnt the hold, their arms
  Hacked, and their foreheads grimed with smoke, and seared,
  Followed, and in among bright faces, ours,
  Full of the vision, prest:  and then the King
  Spake to me, being nearest, "Percivale,"
  (Because the hall was all in tumult--some
  Vowing, and some protesting), "what is this?"

     'O brother, when I told him what had chanced,
  My sister's vision, and the rest, his face
  Darkened, as I have seen it more than once,
  When some brave deed seemed to be done in vain,
  Darken; and "Woe is me, my knights," he cried,
  "Had I been here, ye had not sworn the vow."
  Bold was mine answer, "Had thyself been here,
  My King, thou wouldst have sworn."  "Yea, yea," said he,
  "Art thou so bold and hast not seen the Grail?"

     '"Nay, lord, I heard the sound, I saw the light,
  But since I did not see the Holy Thing,
  I sware a vow to follow it till I saw."

     'Then when he asked us, knight by knight, if any
  Had seen it, all their answers were as one:
  "Nay, lord, and therefore have we sworn our vows."

     '"Lo now," said Arthur, "have ye seen a cloud?
  What go ye into the wilderness to see?"

     'Then Galahad on the sudden, and in a voice
  Shrilling along the hall to Arthur, called,
  "But I, Sir Arthur, saw the Holy Grail,
  I saw the Holy Grail and heard a cry--
  'O Galahad, and O Galahad, follow me.'"

     '"Ah, Galahad, Galahad," said the King, "for such
  As thou art is the vision, not for these.
  Thy holy nun and thou have seen a sign--
  Holier is none, my Percivale, than she--
  A sign to maim this Order which I made.
  But ye, that follow but the leader's bell"
  (Brother, the King was hard upon his knights)
  "Taliessin is our fullest throat of song,
  And one hath sung and all the dumb will sing.
  Lancelot is Lancelot, and hath overborne
  Five knights at once, and every younger knight,
  Unproven, holds himself as Lancelot,
  Till overborne by one, he learns--and ye,
  What are ye? Galahads?--no, nor Percivales"
  (For thus it pleased the King to range me close
  After Sir Galahad); "nay," said he, "but men
  With strength and will to right the wronged, of power
  To lay the sudden heads of violence flat,
  Knights that in twelve great battles splashed and dyed
  The strong White Horse in his own heathen blood--
  But one hath seen, and all the blind will see.
  Go, since your vows are sacred, being made:
  Yet--for ye know the cries of all my realm
  Pass through this hall--how often, O my knights,
  Your places being vacant at my side,
  This chance of noble deeds will come and go
  Unchallenged, while ye follow wandering fires
  Lost in the quagmire!  Many of you, yea most,
  Return no more:  ye think I show myself
  Too dark a prophet:  come now, let us meet
  The morrow morn once more in one full field
  Of gracious pastime, that once more the King,
  Before ye leave him for this Quest, may count
  The yet-unbroken strength of all his knights,
  Rejoicing in that Order which he made."

     'So when the sun broke next from under ground,
  All the great table of our Arthur closed
  And clashed in such a tourney and so full,
  So many lances broken--never yet
  Had Camelot seen the like, since Arthur came;
  And I myself and Galahad, for a strength
  Was in us from this vision, overthrew
  So many knights that all the people cried,
  And almost burst the barriers in their heat,
  Shouting, "Sir Galahad and Sir Percivale!"

     'But when the next day brake from under ground--
  O brother, had you known our Camelot,
  Built by old kings, age after age, so old
  The King himself had fears that it would fall,
  So strange, and rich, and dim; for where the roofs
  Tottered toward each other in the sky,
  Met foreheads all along the street of those
  Who watched us pass; and lower, and where the long
  Rich galleries, lady-laden, weighed the necks
  Of dragons clinging to the crazy walls,
  Thicker than drops from thunder, showers of flowers
  Fell as we past; and men and boys astride
  On wyvern, lion, dragon, griffin, swan,
  At all the corners, named us each by name,
  Calling, "God speed!" but in the ways below
  The knights and ladies wept, and rich and poor
  Wept, and the King himself could hardly speak
  For grief, and all in middle street the Queen,
  Who rode by Lancelot, wailed and shrieked aloud,
  "This madness has come on us for our sins."
  So to the Gate of the three Queens we came,
  Where Arthur's wars are rendered mystically,
  And thence departed every one his way.

     'And I was lifted up in heart, and thought
  Of all my late-shown prowess in the lists,
  How my strong lance had beaten down the knights,
  So many and famous names; and never yet
  Had heaven appeared so blue, nor earth so green,
  For all my blood danced in me, and I knew
  That I should light upon the Holy Grail.

     'Thereafter, the dark warning of our King,
  That most of us would follow wandering fires,
  Came like a driving gloom across my mind.
  Then every evil word I had spoken once,
  And every evil thought I had thought of old,
  And every evil deed I ever did,
  Awoke and cried, "This Quest is not for thee."
  And lifting up mine eyes, I found myself
  Alone, and in a land of sand and thorns,
  And I was thirsty even unto death;
  And I, too, cried, "This Quest is not for thee."

     'And on I rode, and when I thought my thirst
  Would slay me, saw deep lawns, and then a brook,
  With one sharp rapid, where the crisping white
  Played ever back upon the sloping wave,
  And took both ear and eye; and o'er the brook
  Were apple-trees, and apples by the brook
  Fallen, and on the lawns.  "I will rest here,"
  I said, "I am not worthy of the Quest;"
  But even while I drank the brook, and ate
  The goodly apples, all these things at once
  Fell into dust, and I was left alone,
  And thirsting, in a land of sand and thorns.

     'And then behold a woman at a door
  Spinning; and fair the house whereby she sat,
  And kind the woman's eyes and innocent,
  And all her bearing gracious; and she rose
  Opening her arms to meet me, as who should say,
  "Rest here;" but when I touched her, lo! she, too,
  Fell into dust and nothing, and the house
  Became no better than a broken shed,
  And in it a dead babe; and also this
  Fell into dust, and I was left alone.

     'And on I rode, and greater was my thirst.
  Then flashed a yellow gleam across the world,
  And where it smote the plowshare in the field,
  The plowman left his plowing, and fell down
  Before it; where it glittered on her pail,
  The milkmaid left her milking, and fell down
  Before it, and I knew not why, but thought
  "The sun is rising," though the sun had risen.
  Then was I ware of one that on me moved
  In golden armour with a crown of gold
  About a casque all jewels; and his horse
  In golden armour jewelled everywhere:
  And on the splendour came, flashing me blind;
  And seemed to me the Lord of all the world,
  Being so huge.  But when I thought he meant
  To crush me, moving on me, lo! he, too,
  Opened his arms to embrace me as he came,
  And up I went and touched him, and he, too,
  Fell into dust, and I was left alone
  And wearying in a land of sand and thorns.

     'And I rode on and found a mighty hill,
  And on the top, a city walled:  the spires
  Pricked with incredible pinnacles into heaven.
  And by the gateway stirred a crowd; and these
  Cried to me climbing, "Welcome, Percivale!
  Thou mightiest and thou purest among men!"
  And glad was I and clomb, but found at top
  No man, nor any voice.  And thence I past
  Far through a ruinous city, and I saw
  That man had once dwelt there; but there I found
  Only one man of an exceeding age.
  "Where is that goodly company," said I,
  "That so cried out upon me?" and he had
  Scarce any voice to answer, and yet gasped,
  "Whence and what art thou?" and even as he spoke
  Fell into dust, and disappeared, and I
  Was left alone once more, and cried in grief,
  "Lo, if I find the Holy Grail itself
  And touch it, it will crumble into dust."

     'And thence I dropt into a lowly vale,
  Low as the hill was high, and where the vale
  Was lowest, found a chapel, and thereby
  A holy hermit in a hermitage,
  To whom I told my phantoms, and he said:

     '"O son, thou hast not true humility,
  The highest virtue, mother of them all;
  For when the Lord of all things made Himself
  Naked of glory for His mortal change,
  'Take thou my robe,' she said, 'for all is thine,'
  And all her form shone forth with sudden light
  So that the angels were amazed, and she
  Followed Him down, and like a flying star
  Led on the gray-haired wisdom of the east;
  But her thou hast not known:  for what is this
  Thou thoughtest of thy prowess and thy sins?
  Thou hast not lost thyself to save thyself
  As Galahad."  When the hermit made an end,
  In silver armour suddenly Galahad shone
  Before us, and against the chapel door
  Laid lance, and entered, and we knelt in prayer.
  And there the hermit slaked my burning thirst,
  And at the sacring of the mass I saw
  The holy elements alone; but he,
  "Saw ye no more?  I, Galahad, saw the Grail,
  The Holy Grail, descend upon the shrine:
  I saw the fiery face as of a child
  That smote itself into the bread, and went;
  And hither am I come; and never yet
  Hath what thy sister taught me first to see,
  This Holy Thing, failed from my side, nor come
  Covered, but moving with me night and day,
  Fainter by day, but always in the night
  Blood-red, and sliding down the blackened marsh
  Blood-red, and on the naked mountain top
  Blood-red, and in the sleeping mere below
  Blood-red.  And in the strength of this I rode,
  Shattering all evil customs everywhere,
  And past through Pagan realms, and made them mine,
  And clashed with Pagan hordes, and bore them down,
  And broke through all, and in the strength of this
  Come victor.  But my time is hard at hand,
  And hence I go; and one will crown me king
  Far in the spiritual city; and come thou, too,
  For thou shalt see the vision when I go."

     'While thus he spake, his eye, dwelling on mine,
  Drew me, with power upon me, till I grew
  One with him, to believe as he believed.
  Then, when the day began to wane, we went.

     'There rose a hill that none but man could climb,
  Scarred with a hundred wintry water-courses--
  Storm at the top, and when we gained it, storm
  Round us and death; for every moment glanced
  His silver arms and gloomed:  so quick and thick
  The lightnings here and there to left and right
  Struck, till the dry old trunks about us, dead,
  Yea, rotten with a hundred years of death,
  Sprang into fire:  and at the base we found
  On either hand, as far as eye could see,
  A great black swamp and of an evil smell,
  Part black, part whitened with the bones of men,
  Not to be crost, save that some ancient king
  Had built a way, where, linked with many a bridge,
  A thousand piers ran into the great Sea.
  And Galahad fled along them bridge by bridge,
  And every bridge as quickly as he crost
  Sprang into fire and vanished, though I yearned
  To follow; and thrice above him all the heavens
  Opened and blazed with thunder such as seemed
  Shoutings of all the sons of God:  and first
  At once I saw him far on the great Sea,
  In silver-shining armour starry-clear;
  And o'er his head the Holy Vessel hung
  Clothed in white samite or a luminous cloud.
  And with exceeding swiftness ran the boat,
  If boat it were--I saw not whence it came.
  And when the heavens opened and blazed again
  Roaring, I saw him like a silver star--
  And had he set the sail, or had the boat
  Become a living creature clad with wings?
  And o'er his head the Holy Vessel hung
  Redder than any rose, a joy to me,
  For now I knew the veil had been withdrawn.
  Then in a moment when they blazed again
  Opening, I saw the least of little stars
  Down on the waste, and straight beyond the star
  I saw the spiritual city and all her spires
  And gateways in a glory like one pearl--
  No larger, though the goal of all the saints--
  Strike from the sea; and from the star there shot
  A rose-red sparkle to the city, and there
  Dwelt, and I knew it was the Holy Grail,
  Which never eyes on earth again shall see.
  Then fell the floods of heaven drowning the deep.
  And how my feet recrost the deathful ridge
  No memory in me lives; but that I touched
  The chapel-doors at dawn I know; and thence
  Taking my war-horse from the holy man,
  Glad that no phantom vext me more, returned
  To whence I came, the gate of Arthur's wars.'

     'O brother,' asked Ambrosius,--'for in sooth
  These ancient books--and they would win thee--teem,
  Only I find not there this Holy Grail,
  With miracles and marvels like to these,
  Not all unlike; which oftentime I read,
  Who read but on my breviary with ease,
  Till my head swims; and then go forth and pass
  Down to the little thorpe that lies so close,
  And almost plastered like a martin's nest
  To these old walls--and mingle with our folk;
  And knowing every honest face of theirs
  As well as ever shepherd knew his sheep,
  And every homely secret in their hearts,
  Delight myself with gossip and old wives,
  And ills and aches, and teethings, lyings-in,
  And mirthful sayings, children of the place,
  That have no meaning half a league away:
  Or lulling random squabbles when they rise,
  Chafferings and chatterings at the market-cross,
  Rejoice, small man, in this small world of mine,
  Yea, even in their hens and in their eggs--
  O brother, saving this Sir Galahad,
  Came ye on none but phantoms in your quest,
  No man, no woman?'

                    Then Sir Percivale:
  'All men, to one so bound by such a vow,
  And women were as phantoms.  O, my brother,
  Why wilt thou shame me to confess to thee
  How far I faltered from my quest and vow?
  For after I had lain so many nights
  A bedmate of the snail and eft and snake,
  In grass and burdock, I was changed to wan
  And meagre, and the vision had not come;
  And then I chanced upon a goodly town
  With one great dwelling in the middle of it;
  Thither I made, and there was I disarmed
  By maidens each as fair as any flower:
  But when they led me into hall, behold,
  The Princess of that castle was the one,
  Brother, and that one only, who had ever
  Made my heart leap; for when I moved of old
  A slender page about her father's hall,
  And she a slender maiden, all my heart
  Went after her with longing:  yet we twain
  Had never kissed a kiss, or vowed a vow.
  And now I came upon her once again,
  And one had wedded her, and he was dead,
  And all his land and wealth and state were hers.
  And while I tarried, every day she set
  A banquet richer than the day before
  By me; for all her longing and her will
  Was toward me as of old; till one fair morn,
  I walking to and fro beside a stream
  That flashed across her orchard underneath
  Her castle-walls, she stole upon my walk,
  And calling me the greatest of all knights,
  Embraced me, and so kissed me the first time,
  And gave herself and all her wealth to me.
  Then I remembered Arthur's warning word,
  That most of us would follow wandering fires,
  And the Quest faded in my heart.  Anon,
  The heads of all her people drew to me,
  With supplication both of knees and tongue:
  "We have heard of thee:  thou art our greatest knight,
  Our Lady says it, and we well believe:
  Wed thou our Lady, and rule over us,
  And thou shalt be as Arthur in our land."
  O me, my brother! but one night my vow
  Burnt me within, so that I rose and fled,
  But wailed and wept, and hated mine own self,
  And even the Holy Quest, and all but her;
  Then after I was joined with Galahad
  Cared not for her, nor anything upon earth.'

     Then said the monk, 'Poor men, when yule is cold,
  Must be content to sit by little fires.
  And this am I, so that ye care for me
  Ever so little; yea, and blest be Heaven
  That brought thee here to this poor house of ours
  Where all the brethren are so hard, to warm
  My cold heart with a friend:  but O the pity
  To find thine own first love once more--to hold,
  Hold her a wealthy bride within thine arms,
  Or all but hold, and then--cast her aside,
  Foregoing all her sweetness, like a weed.
  For we that want the warmth of double life,
  We that are plagued with dreams of something sweet
  Beyond all sweetness in a life so rich,--
  Ah, blessed Lord, I speak too earthlywise,
  Seeing I never strayed beyond the cell,
  But live like an old badger in his earth,
  With earth about him everywhere, despite
  All fast and penance.  Saw ye none beside,
  None of your knights?'

                        'Yea so,' said Percivale:
  'One night my pathway swerving east, I saw
  The pelican on the casque of our Sir Bors
  All in the middle of the rising moon:
  And toward him spurred, and hailed him, and he me,
  And each made joy of either; then he asked,
  "Where is he? hast thou seen him--Lancelot?--Once,"
  Said good Sir Bors, "he dashed across me--mad,
  And maddening what he rode:  and when I cried,
  'Ridest thou then so hotly on a quest
  So holy,' Lancelot shouted, 'Stay me not!
  I have been the sluggard, and I ride apace,
  For now there is a lion in the way.'
  So vanished."

               'Then Sir Bors had ridden on
  Softly, and sorrowing for our Lancelot,
  Because his former madness, once the talk
  And scandal of our table, had returned;
  For Lancelot's kith and kin so worship him
  That ill to him is ill to them; to Bors
  Beyond the rest:  he well had been content
  Not to have seen, so Lancelot might have seen,
  The Holy Cup of healing; and, indeed,
  Being so clouded with his grief and love,
  Small heart was his after the Holy Quest:
  If God would send the vision, well:  if not,
  The Quest and he were in the hands of Heaven.

     'And then, with small adventure met, Sir Bors
  Rode to the lonest tract of all the realm,
  And found a people there among their crags,
  Our race and blood, a remnant that were left
  Paynim amid their circles, and the stones
  They pitch up straight to heaven:  and their wise men
  Were strong in that old magic which can trace
  The wandering of the stars, and scoffed at him
  And this high Quest as at a simple thing:
  Told him he followed--almost Arthur's words--
  A mocking fire:  "what other fire than he,
  Whereby the blood beats, and the blossom blows,
  And the sea rolls, and all the world is warmed?"
  And when his answer chafed them, the rough crowd,
  Hearing he had a difference with their priests,
  Seized him, and bound and plunged him into a cell
  Of great piled stones; and lying bounden there
  In darkness through innumerable hours
  He heard the hollow-ringing heavens sweep
  Over him till by miracle--what else?--
  Heavy as it was, a great stone slipt and fell,
  Such as no wind could move:  and through the gap
  Glimmered the streaming scud:  then came a night
  Still as the day was loud; and through the gap
  The seven clear stars of Arthur's Table Round--
  For, brother, so one night, because they roll
  Through such a round in heaven, we named the stars,
  Rejoicing in ourselves and in our King--
  And these, like bright eyes of familiar friends,
  In on him shone:  "And then to me, to me,"
  Said good Sir Bors, "beyond all hopes of mine,
  Who scarce had prayed or asked it for myself--
  Across the seven clear stars--O grace to me--
  In colour like the fingers of a hand
  Before a burning taper, the sweet Grail
  Glided and past, and close upon it pealed
  A sharp quick thunder."  Afterwards, a maid,
  Who kept our holy faith among her kin
  In secret, entering, loosed and let him go.'

     To whom the monk:  'And I remember now
  That pelican on the casque:  Sir Bors it was
  Who spake so low and sadly at our board;
  And mighty reverent at our grace was he:
  A square-set man and honest; and his eyes,
  An out-door sign of all the warmth within,
  Smiled with his lips--a smile beneath a cloud,
  But heaven had meant it for a sunny one:
  Ay, ay, Sir Bors, who else?  But when ye reached
  The city, found ye all your knights returned,
  Or was there sooth in Arthur's prophecy,
  Tell me, and what said each, and what the King?'

     Then answered Percivale:  'And that can I,
  Brother, and truly; since the living words
  Of so great men as Lancelot and our King
  Pass not from door to door and out again,
  But sit within the house.  O, when we reached
  The city, our horses stumbling as they trode
  On heaps of ruin, hornless unicorns,
  Cracked basilisks, and splintered cockatrices,
  And shattered talbots, which had left the stones
  Raw, that they fell from, brought us to the hall.

     'And there sat Arthur on the dais-throne,
  And those that had gone out upon the Quest,
  Wasted and worn, and but a tithe of them,
  And those that had not, stood before the King,
  Who, when he saw me, rose, and bad me hail,
  Saying, "A welfare in thine eye reproves
  Our fear of some disastrous chance for thee
  On hill, or plain, at sea, or flooding ford.
  So fierce a gale made havoc here of late
  Among the strange devices of our kings;
  Yea, shook this newer, stronger hall of ours,
  And from the statue Merlin moulded for us
  Half-wrenched a golden wing; but now--the Quest,
  This vision--hast thou seen the Holy Cup,
  That Joseph brought of old to Glastonbury?"

     'So when I told him all thyself hast heard,
  Ambrosius, and my fresh but fixt resolve
  To pass away into the quiet life,
  He answered not, but, sharply turning, asked
  Of Gawain, "Gawain, was this Quest for thee?"

     '"Nay, lord," said Gawain, "not for such as I.
  Therefore I communed with a saintly man,
  Who made me sure the Quest was not for me;
  For I was much awearied of the Quest:
  But found a silk pavilion in a field,
  And merry maidens in it; and then this gale
  Tore my pavilion from the tenting-pin,
  And blew my merry maidens all about
  With all discomfort; yea, and but for this,
  My twelvemonth and a day were pleasant to me."

     'He ceased; and Arthur turned to whom at first
  He saw not, for Sir Bors, on entering, pushed
  Athwart the throng to Lancelot, caught his hand,
  Held it, and there, half-hidden by him, stood,
  Until the King espied him, saying to him,
  "Hail, Bors! if ever loyal man and true
  Could see it, thou hast seen the Grail;" and Bors,
  "Ask me not, for I may not speak of it:
  I saw it;" and the tears were in his eyes.

     'Then there remained but Lancelot, for the rest
  Spake but of sundry perils in the storm;
  Perhaps, like him of Cana in Holy Writ,
  Our Arthur kept his best until the last;
  "Thou, too, my Lancelot," asked the king, "my friend,
  Our mightiest, hath this Quest availed for thee?"

     '"Our mightiest!" answered Lancelot, with a groan;
  "O King!"--and when he paused, methought I spied
  A dying fire of madness in his eyes--
  "O King, my friend, if friend of thine I be,
  Happier are those that welter in their sin,
  Swine in the mud, that cannot see for slime,
  Slime of the ditch:  but in me lived a sin
  So strange, of such a kind, that all of pure,
  Noble, and knightly in me twined and clung
  Round that one sin, until the wholesome flower
  And poisonous grew together, each as each,
  Not to be plucked asunder; and when thy knights
  Sware, I sware with them only in the hope
  That could I touch or see the Holy Grail
  They might be plucked asunder.  Then I spake
  To one most holy saint, who wept and said,
  That save they could be plucked asunder, all
  My quest were but in vain; to whom I vowed
  That I would work according as he willed.
  And forth I went, and while I yearned and strove
  To tear the twain asunder in my heart,
  My madness came upon me as of old,
  And whipt me into waste fields far away;
  There was I beaten down by little men,
  Mean knights, to whom the moving of my sword
  And shadow of my spear had been enow
  To scare them from me once; and then I came
  All in my folly to the naked shore,
  Wide flats, where nothing but coarse grasses grew;
  But such a blast, my King, began to blow,
  So loud a blast along the shore and sea,
  Ye could not hear the waters for the blast,
  Though heapt in mounds and ridges all the sea
  Drove like a cataract, and all the sand
  Swept like a river, and the clouded heavens
  Were shaken with the motion and the sound.
  And blackening in the sea-foam swayed a boat,
  Half-swallowed in it, anchored with a chain;
  And in my madness to myself I said,
  'I will embark and I will lose myself,
  And in the great sea wash away my sin.'
  I burst the chain, I sprang into the boat.
  Seven days I drove along the dreary deep,
  And with me drove the moon and all the stars;
  And the wind fell, and on the seventh night
  I heard the shingle grinding in the surge,
  And felt the boat shock earth, and looking up,
  Behold, the enchanted towers of Carbonek,
  A castle like a rock upon a rock,
  With chasm-like portals open to the sea,
  And steps that met the breaker! there was none
  Stood near it but a lion on each side
  That kept the entry, and the moon was full.
  Then from the boat I leapt, and up the stairs.
  There drew my sword.  With sudden-flaring manes
  Those two great beasts rose upright like a man,
  Each gript a shoulder, and I stood between;
  And, when I would have smitten them, heard a voice,
  'Doubt not, go forward; if thou doubt, the beasts
  Will tear thee piecemeal.'  Then with violence
  The sword was dashed from out my hand, and fell.
  And up into the sounding hall I past;
  But nothing in the sounding hall I saw,
  No bench nor table, painting on the wall
  Or shield of knight; only the rounded moon
  Through the tall oriel on the rolling sea.
  But always in the quiet house I heard,
  Clear as a lark, high o'er me as a lark,
  A sweet voice singing in the topmost tower
  To the eastward:  up I climbed a thousand steps
  With pain:  as in a dream I seemed to climb
  For ever:  at the last I reached a door,
  A light was in the crannies, and I heard,
  'Glory and joy and honour to our Lord
  And to the Holy Vessel of the Grail.'
  Then in my madness I essayed the door;
  It gave; and through a stormy glare, a heat
  As from a seventimes-heated furnace, I,
  Blasted and burnt, and blinded as I was,
  With such a fierceness that I swooned away--
  O, yet methought I saw the Holy Grail,
  All palled in crimson samite, and around
  Great angels, awful shapes, and wings and eyes.
  And but for all my madness and my sin,
  And then my swooning, I had sworn I saw
  That which I saw; but what I saw was veiled
  And covered; and this Quest was not for me."

     'So speaking, and here ceasing, Lancelot left
  The hall long silent, till Sir Gawain--nay,
  Brother, I need not tell thee foolish words,--
  A reckless and irreverent knight was he,
  Now boldened by the silence of his King,--
  Well, I will tell thee:  "O King, my liege," he said,
  "Hath Gawain failed in any quest of thine?
  When have I stinted stroke in foughten field?
  But as for thine, my good friend Percivale,
  Thy holy nun and thou have driven men mad,
  Yea, made our mightiest madder than our least.
  But by mine eyes and by mine ears I swear,
  I will be deafer than the blue-eyed cat,
  And thrice as blind as any noonday owl,
  To holy virgins in their ecstasies,
  Henceforward."

                '"Deafer," said the blameless King,
  "Gawain, and blinder unto holy things
  Hope not to make thyself by idle vows,
  Being too blind to have desire to see.
  But if indeed there came a sign from heaven,
  Blessed are Bors, Lancelot and Percivale,
  For these have seen according to their sight.
  For every fiery prophet in old times,
  And all the sacred madness of the bard,
  When God made music through them, could but speak
  His music by the framework and the chord;
  And as ye saw it ye have spoken truth.

     '"Nay--but thou errest, Lancelot:  never yet
  Could all of true and noble in knight and man
  Twine round one sin, whatever it might be,
  With such a closeness, but apart there grew,
  Save that he were the swine thou spakest of,
  Some root of knighthood and pure nobleness;
  Whereto see thou, that it may bear its flower.

     '"And spake I not too truly, O my knights?
  Was I too dark a prophet when I said
  To those who went upon the Holy Quest,
  That most of them would follow wandering fires,
  Lost in the quagmire?--lost to me and gone,
  And left me gazing at a barren board,
  And a lean Order--scarce returned a tithe--
  And out of those to whom the vision came
  My greatest hardly will believe he saw;
  Another hath beheld it afar off,
  And leaving human wrongs to right themselves,
  Cares but to pass into the silent life.
  And one hath had the vision face to face,
  And now his chair desires him here in vain,
  However they may crown him otherwhere.

     '"And some among you held, that if the King
  Had seen the sight he would have sworn the vow:
  Not easily, seeing that the King must guard
  That which he rules, and is but as the hind
  To whom a space of land is given to plow.
  Who may not wander from the allotted field
  Before his work be done; but, being done,
  Let visions of the night or of the day
  Come, as they will; and many a time they come,
  Until this earth he walks on seems not earth,
  This light that strikes his eyeball is not light,
  This air that smites his forehead is not air
  But vision--yea, his very hand and foot--
  In moments when he feels he cannot die,
  And knows himself no vision to himself,
  Nor the high God a vision, nor that One
  Who rose again:  ye have seen what ye have seen."

     'So spake the King:  I knew not all he meant.'



  Pelleas and Ettarre

  King Arthur made new knights to fill the gap
  Left by the Holy Quest; and as he sat
  In hall at old Caerleon, the high doors
  Were softly sundered, and through these a youth,
  Pelleas, and the sweet smell of the fields
  Past, and the sunshine came along with him.

     'Make me thy knight, because I know, Sir King,
  All that belongs to knighthood, and I love.'
  Such was his cry:  for having heard the King
  Had let proclaim a tournament--the prize
  A golden circlet and a knightly sword,
  Full fain had Pelleas for his lady won
  The golden circlet, for himself the sword:
  And there were those who knew him near the King,
  And promised for him:  and Arthur made him knight.

     And this new knight, Sir Pelleas of the isles--
  But lately come to his inheritance,
  And lord of many a barren isle was he--
  Riding at noon, a day or twain before,
  Across the forest called of Dean, to find
  Caerleon and the King, had felt the sun
  Beat like a strong knight on his helm, and reeled
  Almost to falling from his horse; but saw
  Near him a mound of even-sloping side,
  Whereon a hundred stately beeches grew,
  And here and there great hollies under them;
  But for a mile all round was open space,
  And fern and heath:  and slowly Pelleas drew
  To that dim day, then binding his good horse
  To a tree, cast himself down; and as he lay
  At random looking over the brown earth
  Through that green-glooming twilight of the grove,
  It seemed to Pelleas that the fern without
  Burnt as a living fire of emeralds,
  So that his eyes were dazzled looking at it.
  Then o'er it crost the dimness of a cloud
  Floating, and once the shadow of a bird
  Flying, and then a fawn; and his eyes closed.
  And since he loved all maidens, but no maid
  In special, half-awake he whispered, 'Where?
  O where? I love thee, though I know thee not.
  For fair thou art and pure as Guinevere,
  And I will make thee with my spear and sword
  As famous--O my Queen, my Guinevere,
  For I will be thine Arthur when we meet.'

     Suddenly wakened with a sound of talk
  And laughter at the limit of the wood,
  And glancing through the hoary boles, he saw,
  Strange as to some old prophet might have seemed
  A vision hovering on a sea of fire,
  Damsels in divers colours like the cloud
  Of sunset and sunrise, and all of them
  On horses, and the horses richly trapt
  Breast-high in that bright line of bracken stood:
  And all the damsels talked confusedly,
  And one was pointing this way, and one that,
  Because the way was lost.

                           And Pelleas rose,
  And loosed his horse, and led him to the light.
  There she that seemed the chief among them said,
  'In happy time behold our pilot-star!
  Youth, we are damsels-errant, and we ride,
  Armed as ye see, to tilt against the knights
  There at Caerleon, but have lost our way:
  To right? to left? straight forward? back again?
  Which? tell us quickly.'

                          Pelleas gazing thought,
  'Is Guinevere herself so beautiful?'
  For large her violet eyes looked, and her bloom
  A rosy dawn kindled in stainless heavens,
  And round her limbs, mature in womanhood;
  And slender was her hand and small her shape;
  And but for those large eyes, the haunts of scorn,
  She might have seemed a toy to trifle with,
  And pass and care no more.  But while he gazed
  The beauty of her flesh abashed the boy,
  As though it were the beauty of her soul:
  For as the base man, judging of the good,
  Puts his own baseness in him by default
  Of will and nature, so did Pelleas lend
  All the young beauty of his own soul to hers,
  Believing her; and when she spake to him,
  Stammered, and could not make her a reply.
  For out of the waste islands had he come,
  Where saving his own sisters he had known
  Scarce any but the women of his isles,
  Rough wives, that laughed and screamed against the gulls,
  Makers of nets, and living from the sea.

     Then with a slow smile turned the lady round
  And looked upon her people; and as when
  A stone is flung into some sleeping tarn,
  The circle widens till it lip the marge,
  Spread the slow smile through all her company.
  Three knights were thereamong; and they too smiled,
  Scorning him; for the lady was Ettarre,
  And she was a great lady in her land.

     Again she said, 'O wild and of the woods,
  Knowest thou not the fashion of our speech?
  Or have the Heavens but given thee a fair face,
  Lacking a tongue?'

                    'O damsel,' answered he,
  'I woke from dreams; and coming out of gloom
  Was dazzled by the sudden light, and crave
  Pardon:  but will ye to Caerleon?  I
  Go likewise:  shall I lead you to the King?'

     'Lead then,' she said; and through the woods they went.
  And while they rode, the meaning in his eyes,
  His tenderness of manner, and chaste awe,
  His broken utterances and bashfulness,
  Were all a burthen to her, and in her heart
  She muttered, 'I have lighted on a fool,
  Raw, yet so stale!'  But since her mind was bent
  On hearing, after trumpet blown, her name
  And title, 'Queen of Beauty,' in the lists
  Cried--and beholding him so strong, she thought
  That peradventure he will fight for me,
  And win the circlet:  therefore flattered him,
  Being so gracious, that he wellnigh deemed
  His wish by hers was echoed; and her knights
  And all her damsels too were gracious to him,
  For she was a great lady.

                           And when they reached
  Caerleon, ere they past to lodging, she,
  Taking his hand, 'O the strong hand,' she said,
  'See! look at mine! but wilt thou fight for me,
  And win me this fine circlet, Pelleas,
  That I may love thee?'

                        Then his helpless heart
  Leapt, and he cried, 'Ay! wilt thou if I win?'
  'Ay, that will I,' she answered, and she laughed,
  And straitly nipt the hand, and flung it from her;
  Then glanced askew at those three knights of hers,
  Till all her ladies laughed along with her.

     'O happy world,' thought Pelleas, 'all, meseems,
  Are happy; I the happiest of them all.'
  Nor slept that night for pleasure in his blood,
  And green wood-ways, and eyes among the leaves;
  Then being on the morrow knighted, sware
  To love one only.  And as he came away,
  The men who met him rounded on their heels
  And wondered after him, because his face
  Shone like the countenance of a priest of old
  Against the flame about a sacrifice
  Kindled by fire from heaven:  so glad was he.

     Then Arthur made vast banquets, and strange knights
  From the four winds came in:  and each one sat,
  Though served with choice from air, land, stream, and sea,
  Oft in mid-banquet measuring with his eyes
  His neighbour's make and might:  and Pelleas looked
  Noble among the noble, for he dreamed
  His lady loved him, and he knew himself
  Loved of the King:  and him his new-made knight
  Worshipt, whose lightest whisper moved him more
  Than all the ranged reasons of the world.

     Then blushed and brake the morning of the jousts,
  And this was called 'The Tournament of Youth:'
  For Arthur, loving his young knight, withheld
  His older and his mightier from the lists,
  That Pelleas might obtain his lady's love,
  According to her promise, and remain
  Lord of the tourney.  And Arthur had the jousts
  Down in the flat field by the shore of Usk
  Holden:  the gilded parapets were crowned
  With faces, and the great tower filled with eyes
  Up to the summit, and the trumpets blew.
  There all day long Sir Pelleas kept the field
  With honour:  so by that strong hand of his
  The sword and golden circlet were achieved.

     Then rang the shout his lady loved:  the heat
  Of pride and glory fired her face; her eye
  Sparkled; she caught the circlet from his lance,
  And there before the people crowned herself:
  So for the last time she was gracious to him.

     Then at Caerleon for a space--her look
  Bright for all others, cloudier on her knight--
  Lingered Ettarre:  and seeing Pelleas droop,
  Said Guinevere, 'We marvel at thee much,
  O damsel, wearing this unsunny face
  To him who won thee glory!'  And she said,
  'Had ye not held your Lancelot in your bower,
  My Queen, he had not won.'  Whereat the Queen,
  As one whose foot is bitten by an ant,
  Glanced down upon her, turned and went her way.

     But after, when her damsels, and herself,
  And those three knights all set their faces home,
  Sir Pelleas followed.  She that saw him cried,
  'Damsels--and yet I should be shamed to say it--
  I cannot bide Sir Baby.  Keep him back
  Among yourselves.  Would rather that we had
  Some rough old knight who knew the worldly way,
  Albeit grizzlier than a bear, to ride
  And jest with:  take him to you, keep him off,
  And pamper him with papmeat, if ye will,
  Old milky fables of the wolf and sheep,
  Such as the wholesome mothers tell their boys.
  Nay, should ye try him with a merry one
  To find his mettle, good:  and if he fly us,
  Small matter! let him.'  This her damsels heard,
  And mindful of her small and cruel hand,
  They, closing round him through the journey home,
  Acted her hest, and always from her side
  Restrained him with all manner of device,
  So that he could not come to speech with her.
  And when she gained her castle, upsprang the bridge,
  Down rang the grate of iron through the groove,
  And he was left alone in open field.

     'These be the ways of ladies,' Pelleas thought,
  'To those who love them, trials of our faith.
  Yea, let her prove me to the uttermost,
  For loyal to the uttermost am I.'
  So made his moan; and darkness falling, sought
  A priory not far off, there lodged, but rose
  With morning every day, and, moist or dry,
  Full-armed upon his charger all day long
  Sat by the walls, and no one opened to him.

     And this persistence turned her scorn to wrath.
  Then calling her three knights, she charged them, 'Out!
  And drive him from the walls.'  And out they came
  But Pelleas overthrew them as they dashed
  Against him one by one; and these returned,
  But still he kept his watch beneath the wall.

     Thereon her wrath became a hate; and once,
  A week beyond, while walking on the walls
  With her three knights, she pointed downward, 'Look,
  He haunts me--I cannot breathe--besieges me;
  Down! strike him! put my hate into your strokes,
  And drive him from my walls.'  And down they went,
  And Pelleas overthrew them one by one;
  And from the tower above him cried Ettarre,
  'Bind him, and bring him in.'

                               He heard her voice;
  Then let the strong hand, which had overthrown
  Her minion-knights, by those he overthrew
  Be bounden straight, and so they brought him in.

     Then when he came before Ettarre, the sight
  Of her rich beauty made him at one glance
  More bondsman in his heart than in his bonds.
  Yet with good cheer he spake, 'Behold me, Lady,
  A prisoner, and the vassal of thy will;
  And if thou keep me in thy donjon here,
  Content am I so that I see thy face
  But once a day:  for I have sworn my vows,
  And thou hast given thy promise, and I know
  That all these pains are trials of my faith,
  And that thyself, when thou hast seen me strained
  And sifted to the utmost, wilt at length
  Yield me thy love and know me for thy knight.'

     Then she began to rail so bitterly,
  With all her damsels, he was stricken mute;
  But when she mocked his vows and the great King,
  Lighted on words:  'For pity of thine own self,
  Peace, Lady, peace:  is he not thine and mine?'
  'Thou fool,' she said, 'I never heard his voice
  But longed to break away.  Unbind him now,
  And thrust him out of doors; for save he be
  Fool to the midmost marrow of his bones,
  He will return no more.'  And those, her three,
  Laughed, and unbound, and thrust him from the gate.

     And after this, a week beyond, again
  She called them, saying, 'There he watches yet,
  There like a dog before his master's door!
  Kicked, he returns:  do ye not hate him, ye?
  Ye know yourselves:  how can ye bide at peace,
  Affronted with his fulsome innocence?
  Are ye but creatures of the board and bed,
  No men to strike?  Fall on him all at once,
  And if ye slay him I reck not:  if ye fail,
  Give ye the slave mine order to be bound,
  Bind him as heretofore, and bring him in:
  It may be ye shall slay him in his bonds.'

     She spake; and at her will they couched their spears,
  Three against one:  and Gawain passing by,
  Bound upon solitary adventure, saw
  Low down beneath the shadow of those towers
  A villainy, three to one:  and through his heart
  The fire of honour and all noble deeds
  Flashed, and he called, 'I strike upon thy side--
  The caitiffs!'  'Nay,' said Pelleas, 'but forbear;
  He needs no aid who doth his lady's will.'

     So Gawain, looking at the villainy done,
  Forbore, but in his heat and eagerness
  Trembled and quivered, as the dog, withheld
  A moment from the vermin that he sees
  Before him, shivers, ere he springs and kills.

     And Pelleas overthrew them, one to three;
  And they rose up, and bound, and brought him in.
  Then first her anger, leaving Pelleas, burned
  Full on her knights in many an evil name
  Of craven, weakling, and thrice-beaten hound:
  'Yet, take him, ye that scarce are fit to touch,
  Far less to bind, your victor, and thrust him out,
  And let who will release him from his bonds.
  And if he comes again'--there she brake short;
  And Pelleas answered, 'Lady, for indeed
  I loved you and I deemed you beautiful,
  I cannot brook to see your beauty marred
  Through evil spite:  and if ye love me not,
  I cannot bear to dream you so forsworn:
  I had liefer ye were worthy of my love,
  Than to be loved again of you--farewell;
  And though ye kill my hope, not yet my love,
  Vex not yourself:  ye will not see me more.'

     While thus he spake, she gazed upon the man
  Of princely bearing, though in bonds, and thought,
  'Why have I pushed him from me? this man loves,
  If love there be:  yet him I loved not.  Why?
  I deemed him fool? yea, so? or that in him
  A something--was it nobler than myself?
  Seemed my reproach?  He is not of my kind.
  He could not love me, did he know me well.
  Nay, let him go--and quickly.'  And her knights
  Laughed not, but thrust him bounden out of door.

     Forth sprang Gawain, and loosed him from his bonds,
  And flung them o'er the walls; and afterward,
  Shaking his hands, as from a lazar's rag,
  'Faith of my body,' he said, 'and art thou not--
  Yea thou art he, whom late our Arthur made
  Knight of his table; yea and he that won
  The circlet? wherefore hast thou so defamed
  Thy brotherhood in me and all the rest,
  As let these caitiffs on thee work their will?'

     And Pelleas answered, 'O, their wills are hers
  For whom I won the circlet; and mine, hers,
  Thus to be bounden, so to see her face,
  Marred though it be with spite and mockery now,
  Other than when I found her in the woods;
  And though she hath me bounden but in spite,
  And all to flout me, when they bring me in,
  Let me be bounden, I shall see her face;
  Else must I die through mine unhappiness.'

     And Gawain answered kindly though in scorn,
  'Why, let my lady bind me if she will,
  And let my lady beat me if she will:
  But an she send her delegate to thrall
  These fighting hands of mine--Christ kill me then
  But I will slice him handless by the wrist,
  And let my lady sear the stump for him,
  Howl as he may.  But hold me for your friend:
  Come, ye know nothing:  here I pledge my troth,
  Yea, by the honour of the Table Round,
  I will be leal to thee and work thy work,
  And tame thy jailing princess to thine hand.
  Lend me thine horse and arms, and I will say
  That I have slain thee.  She will let me in
  To hear the manner of thy fight and fall;
  Then, when I come within her counsels, then
  From prime to vespers will I chant thy praise
  As prowest knight and truest lover, more
  Than any have sung thee living, till she long
  To have thee back in lusty life again,
  Not to be bound, save by white bonds and warm,
  Dearer than freedom.  Wherefore now thy horse
  And armour:  let me go:  be comforted:
  Give me three days to melt her fancy, and hope
  The third night hence will bring thee news of gold.'

     Then Pelleas lent his horse and all his arms,
  Saving the goodly sword, his prize, and took
  Gawain's, and said, 'Betray me not, but help--
  Art thou not he whom men call light-of-love?'

     'Ay,' said Gawain, 'for women be so light.'
  Then bounded forward to the castle walls,
  And raised a bugle hanging from his neck,
  And winded it, and that so musically
  That all the old echoes hidden in the wall
  Rang out like hollow woods at hunting-tide.

     Up ran a score of damsels to the tower;
  'Avaunt,' they cried, 'our lady loves thee not.'
  But Gawain lifting up his vizor said,
  'Gawain am I, Gawain of Arthur's court,
  And I have slain this Pelleas whom ye hate:
  Behold his horse and armour.  Open gates,
  And I will make you merry.'

                             And down they ran,
  Her damsels, crying to their lady, 'Lo!
  Pelleas is dead--he told us--he that hath
  His horse and armour:  will ye let him in?
  He slew him!  Gawain, Gawain of the court,
  Sir Gawain--there he waits below the wall,
  Blowing his bugle as who should say him nay.'

     And so, leave given, straight on through open door
  Rode Gawain, whom she greeted courteously.
  'Dead, is it so?' she asked.  'Ay, ay,' said he,
  'And oft in dying cried upon your name.'
  'Pity on him,' she answered, 'a good knight,
  But never let me bide one hour at peace.'
  'Ay,' thought Gawain, 'and you be fair enow:
  But I to your dead man have given my troth,
  That whom ye loathe, him will I make you love.'

     So those three days, aimless about the land,
  Lost in a doubt, Pelleas wandering
  Waited, until the third night brought a moon
  With promise of large light on woods and ways.

     Hot was the night and silent; but a sound
  Of Gawain ever coming, and this lay--
  Which Pelleas had heard sung before the Queen,
  And seen her sadden listening--vext his heart,
  And marred his rest--'A worm within the rose.'

     'A rose, but one, none other rose had I,
  A rose, one rose, and this was wondrous fair,
  One rose, a rose that gladdened earth and sky,
  One rose, my rose, that sweetened all mine air--
  I cared not for the thorns; the thorns were there.

     'One rose, a rose to gather by and by,
  One rose, a rose, to gather and to wear,
  No rose but one--what other rose had I?
  One rose, my rose; a rose that will not die,--
  He dies who loves it,--if the worm be there.'

     This tender rhyme, and evermore the doubt,
  'Why lingers Gawain with his golden news?'
  So shook him that he could not rest, but rode
  Ere midnight to her walls, and bound his horse
  Hard by the gates.  Wide open were the gates,
  And no watch kept; and in through these he past,
  And heard but his own steps, and his own heart
  Beating, for nothing moved but his own self,
  And his own shadow.  Then he crost the court,
  And spied not any light in hall or bower,
  But saw the postern portal also wide
  Yawning; and up a slope of garden, all
  Of roses white and red, and brambles mixt
  And overgrowing them, went on, and found,
  Here too, all hushed below the mellow moon,
  Save that one rivulet from a tiny cave
  Came lightening downward, and so spilt itself
  Among the roses, and was lost again.

     Then was he ware of three pavilions reared
  Above the bushes, gilden-peakt:  in one,
  Red after revel, droned her lurdane knights
  Slumbering, and their three squires across their feet:
  In one, their malice on the placid lip
  Frozen by sweet sleep, four of her damsels lay:
  And in the third, the circlet of the jousts
  Bound on her brow, were Gawain and Ettarre.

     Back, as a hand that pushes through the leaf
  To find a nest and feels a snake, he drew:
  Back, as a coward slinks from what he fears
  To cope with, or a traitor proven, or hound
  Beaten, did Pelleas in an utter shame
  Creep with his shadow through the court again,
  Fingering at his sword-handle until he stood
  There on the castle-bridge once more, and thought,
  'I will go back, and slay them where they lie.'

     And so went back, and seeing them yet in sleep
  Said, 'Ye, that so dishallow the holy sleep,
  Your sleep is death,' and drew the sword, and thought,
  'What! slay a sleeping knight? the King hath bound
  And sworn me to this brotherhood;' again,
  'Alas that ever a knight should be so false.'
  Then turned, and so returned, and groaning laid
  The naked sword athwart their naked throats,
  There left it, and them sleeping; and she lay,
  The circlet of her tourney round her brows,
  And the sword of the tourney across her throat.

     And forth he past, and mounting on his horse
  Stared at her towers that, larger than themselves
  In their own darkness, thronged into the moon.
  Then crushed the saddle with his thighs, and clenched
  His hands, and maddened with himself and moaned:

     'Would they have risen against me in their blood
  At the last day?  I might have answered them
  Even before high God.  O towers so strong,
  Huge, solid, would that even while I gaze
  The crack of earthquake shivering to your base
  Split you, and Hell burst up your harlot roofs
  Bellowing, and charred you through and through within,
  Black as the harlot's heart--hollow as a skull!
  Let the fierce east scream through your eyelet-holes,
  And whirl the dust of harlots round and round
  In dung and nettles! hiss, snake--I saw him there--
  Let the fox bark, let the wolf yell.  Who yells
  Here in the still sweet summer night, but I--
  I, the poor Pelleas whom she called her fool?
  Fool, beast--he, she, or I? myself most fool;
  Beast too, as lacking human wit--disgraced,
  Dishonoured all for trial of true love--
  Love?--we be all alike:  only the King
  Hath made us fools and liars.  O noble vows!
  O great and sane and simple race of brutes
  That own no lust because they have no law!
  For why should I have loved her to my shame?
  I loathe her, as I loved her to my shame.
  I never loved her, I but lusted for her--
  Away--'
         He dashed the rowel into his horse,
  And bounded forth and vanished through the night.

     Then she, that felt the cold touch on her throat,
  Awaking knew the sword, and turned herself
  To Gawain:  'Liar, for thou hast not slain
  This Pelleas! here he stood, and might have slain
  Me and thyself.'  And he that tells the tale
  Says that her ever-veering fancy turned
  To Pelleas, as the one true knight on earth,
  And only lover; and through her love her life
  Wasted and pined, desiring him in vain.

     But he by wild and way, for half the night,
  And over hard and soft, striking the sod
  From out the soft, the spark from off the hard,
  Rode till the star above the wakening sun,
  Beside that tower where Percivale was cowled,
  Glanced from the rosy forehead of the dawn.
  For so the words were flashed into his heart
  He knew not whence or wherefore:  'O sweet star,
  Pure on the virgin forehead of the dawn!'
  And there he would have wept, but felt his eyes
  Harder and drier than a fountain bed
  In summer:  thither came the village girls
  And lingered talking, and they come no more
  Till the sweet heavens have filled it from the heights
  Again with living waters in the change
  Of seasons:  hard his eyes; harder his heart
  Seemed; but so weary were his limbs, that he,
  Gasping, 'Of Arthur's hall am I, but here,
  Here let me rest and die,' cast himself down,
  And gulfed his griefs in inmost sleep; so lay,
  Till shaken by a dream, that Gawain fired
  The hall of Merlin, and the morning star
  Reeled in the smoke, brake into flame, and fell.

     He woke, and being ware of some one nigh,
  Sent hands upon him, as to tear him, crying,
  'False! and I held thee pure as Guinevere.'

     But Percivale stood near him and replied,
  'Am I but false as Guinevere is pure?
  Or art thou mazed with dreams? or being one
  Of our free-spoken Table hast not heard
  That Lancelot'--there he checked himself and paused.

     Then fared it with Sir Pelleas as with one
  Who gets a wound in battle, and the sword
  That made it plunges through the wound again,
  And pricks it deeper:  and he shrank and wailed,
  'Is the Queen false?' and Percivale was mute.
  'Have any of our Round Table held their vows?'
  And Percivale made answer not a word.
  'Is the King true?'  'The King!' said Percivale.
  'Why then let men couple at once with wolves.
  What! art thou mad?'

                      But Pelleas, leaping up,
  Ran through the doors and vaulted on his horse
  And fled:  small pity upon his horse had he,
  Or on himself, or any, and when he met
  A cripple, one that held a hand for alms--
  Hunched as he was, and like an old dwarf-elm
  That turns its back upon the salt blast, the boy
  Paused not, but overrode him, shouting, 'False,
  And false with Gawain!' and so left him bruised
  And battered, and fled on, and hill and wood
  Went ever streaming by him till the gloom,
  That follows on the turning of the world,
  Darkened the common path:  he twitched the reins,
  And made his beast that better knew it, swerve
  Now off it and now on; but when he saw
  High up in heaven the hall that Merlin built,
  Blackening against the dead-green stripes of even,
  'Black nest of rats,' he groaned, 'ye build too high.'

     Not long thereafter from the city gates
  Issued Sir Lancelot riding airily,
  Warm with a gracious parting from the Queen,
  Peace at his heart, and gazing at a star
  And marvelling what it was:  on whom the boy,
  Across the silent seeded meadow-grass
  Borne, clashed:  and Lancelot, saying, 'What name hast thou
  That ridest here so blindly and so hard?'
  'No name, no name,' he shouted, 'a scourge am I
  To lash the treasons of the Table Round.'
  'Yea, but thy name?'  'I have many names,' he cried:
  'I am wrath and shame and hate and evil fame,
  And like a poisonous wind I pass to blast
  And blaze the crime of Lancelot and the Queen.'
  'First over me,' said Lancelot, 'shalt thou pass.'
  'Fight therefore,' yelled the youth, and either knight
  Drew back a space, and when they closed, at once
  The weary steed of Pelleas floundering flung
  His rider, who called out from the dark field,
  'Thou art as false as Hell:  slay me:  I have no sword.'
  Then Lancelot, 'Yea, between thy lips--and sharp;
  But here I will disedge it by thy death.'
  'Slay then,' he shrieked, 'my will is to be slain,'
  And Lancelot, with his heel upon the fallen,
  Rolling his eyes, a moment stood, then spake:
  'Rise, weakling; I am Lancelot; say thy say.'

     And Lancelot slowly rode his warhorse back
  To Camelot, and Sir Pelleas in brief while
  Caught his unbroken limbs from the dark field,
  And followed to the city.  It chanced that both
  Brake into hall together, worn and pale.
  There with her knights and dames was Guinevere.
  Full wonderingly she gazed on Lancelot
  So soon returned, and then on Pelleas, him
  Who had not greeted her, but cast himself
  Down on a bench, hard-breathing.  'Have ye fought?'
  She asked of Lancelot.  'Ay, my Queen,' he said.
  'And hast thou overthrown him?'  'Ay, my Queen.'
  Then she, turning to Pelleas, 'O young knight,
  Hath the great heart of knighthood in thee failed
  So far thou canst not bide, unfrowardly,
  A fall from him?'  Then, for he answered not,
  'Or hast thou other griefs?  If I, the Queen,
  May help them, loose thy tongue, and let me know.'
  But Pelleas lifted up an eye so fierce
  She quailed; and he, hissing 'I have no sword,'
  Sprang from the door into the dark.  The Queen
  Looked hard upon her lover, he on her;
  And each foresaw the dolorous day to be:
  And all talk died, as in a grove all song
  Beneath the shadow of some bird of prey;
  Then a long silence came upon the hall,
  And Modred thought, 'The time is hard at hand.'



  The Last Tournament

  Dagonet, the fool, whom Gawain in his mood
  Had made mock-knight of Arthur's Table Round,
  At Camelot, high above the yellowing woods,
  Danced like a withered leaf before the hall.
  And toward him from the hall, with harp in hand,
  And from the crown thereof a carcanet
  Of ruby swaying to and fro, the prize
  Of Tristram in the jousts of yesterday,
  Came Tristram, saying, 'Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?'

     For Arthur and Sir Lancelot riding once
  Far down beneath a winding wall of rock
  Heard a child wail.  A stump of oak half-dead,
  From roots like some black coil of carven snakes,
  Clutched at the crag, and started through mid air
  Bearing an eagle's nest:  and through the tree
  Rushed ever a rainy wind, and through the wind
  Pierced ever a child's cry:  and crag and tree
  Scaling, Sir Lancelot from the perilous nest,
  This ruby necklace thrice around her neck,
  And all unscarred from beak or talon, brought
  A maiden babe; which Arthur pitying took,
  Then gave it to his Queen to rear:  the Queen
  But coldly acquiescing, in her white arms
  Received, and after loved it tenderly,
  And named it Nestling; so forgot herself
  A moment, and her cares; till that young life
  Being smitten in mid heaven with mortal cold
  Past from her; and in time the carcanet
  Vext her with plaintive memories of the child:
  So she, delivering it to Arthur, said,
  'Take thou the jewels of this dead innocence,
  And make them, an thou wilt, a tourney-prize.'

     To whom the King, 'Peace to thine eagle-borne
  Dead nestling, and this honour after death,
  Following thy will! but, O my Queen, I muse
  Why ye not wear on arm, or neck, or zone
  Those diamonds that I rescued from the tarn,
  And Lancelot won, methought, for thee to wear.'

     'Would rather you had let them fall,' she cried,
  'Plunge and be lost--ill-fated as they were,
  A bitterness to me!--ye look amazed,
  Not knowing they were lost as soon as given--
  Slid from my hands, when I was leaning out
  Above the river--that unhappy child
  Past in her barge:  but rosier luck will go
  With these rich jewels, seeing that they came
  Not from the skeleton of a brother-slayer,
  But the sweet body of a maiden babe.
  Perchance--who knows?--the purest of thy knights
  May win them for the purest of my maids.'

     She ended, and the cry of a great jousts
  With trumpet-blowings ran on all the ways
  From Camelot in among the faded fields
  To furthest towers; and everywhere the knights
  Armed for a day of glory before the King.

     But on the hither side of that loud morn
  Into the hall staggered, his visage ribbed
  From ear to ear with dogwhip-weals, his nose
  Bridge-broken, one eye out, and one hand off,
  And one with shattered fingers dangling lame,
  A churl, to whom indignantly the King,

     'My churl, for whom Christ died, what evil beast
  Hath drawn his claws athwart thy face? or fiend?
  Man was it who marred heaven's image in thee thus?'

     Then, sputtering through the hedge of splintered teeth,
  Yet strangers to the tongue, and with blunt stump
  Pitch-blackened sawing the air, said the maimed churl,

     'He took them and he drave them to his tower--
  Some hold he was a table-knight of thine--
  A hundred goodly ones--the Red Knight, he--
  Lord, I was tending swine, and the Red Knight
  Brake in upon me and drave them to his tower;
  And when I called upon thy name as one
  That doest right by gentle and by churl,
  Maimed me and mauled, and would outright have slain,
  Save that he sware me to a message, saying,
  "Tell thou the King and all his liars, that I
  Have founded my Round Table in the North,
  And whatsoever his own knights have sworn
  My knights have sworn the counter to it--and say
  My tower is full of harlots, like his court,
  But mine are worthier, seeing they profess
  To be none other than themselves--and say
  My knights are all adulterers like his own,
  But mine are truer, seeing they profess
  To be none other; and say his hour is come,
  The heathen are upon him, his long lance
  Broken, and his Excalibur a straw."'

     Then Arthur turned to Kay the seneschal,
  'Take thou my churl, and tend him curiously
  Like a king's heir, till all his hurts be whole.
  The heathen--but that ever-climbing wave,
  Hurled back again so often in empty foam,
  Hath lain for years at rest--and renegades,
  Thieves, bandits, leavings of confusion, whom
  The wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere,
  Friends, through your manhood and your fealty,--now
  Make their last head like Satan in the North.
  My younger knights, new-made, in whom your flower
  Waits to be solid fruit of golden deeds,
  Move with me toward their quelling, which achieved,
  The loneliest ways are safe from shore to shore.
  But thou, Sir Lancelot, sitting in my place
  Enchaired tomorrow, arbitrate the field;
  For wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with it,
  Only to yield my Queen her own again?
  Speak, Lancelot, thou art silent:  is it well?'

     Thereto Sir Lancelot answered, 'It is well:
  Yet better if the King abide, and leave
  The leading of his younger knights to me.
  Else, for the King has willed it, it is well.'

     Then Arthur rose and Lancelot followed him,
  And while they stood without the doors, the King
  Turned to him saying, 'Is it then so well?
  Or mine the blame that oft I seem as he
  Of whom was written, "A sound is in his ears"?
  The foot that loiters, bidden go,--the glance
  That only seems half-loyal to command,--
  A manner somewhat fallen from reverence--
  Or have I dreamed the bearing of our knights
  Tells of a manhood ever less and lower?
  Or whence the fear lest this my realm, upreared,
  By noble deeds at one with noble vows,
  From flat confusion and brute violences,
  Reel back into the beast, and be no more?'

     He spoke, and taking all his younger knights,
  Down the slope city rode, and sharply turned
  North by the gate.  In her high bower the Queen,
  Working a tapestry, lifted up her head,
  Watched her lord pass, and knew not that she sighed.
  Then ran across her memory the strange rhyme
  Of bygone Merlin, 'Where is he who knows?
  From the great deep to the great deep he goes.'

     But when the morning of a tournament,
  By these in earnest those in mockery called
  The Tournament of the Dead Innocence,
  Brake with a wet wind blowing, Lancelot,
  Round whose sick head all night, like birds of prey,
  The words of Arthur flying shrieked, arose,
  And down a streetway hung with folds of pure
  White samite, and by fountains running wine,
  Where children sat in white with cups of gold,
  Moved to the lists, and there, with slow sad steps
  Ascending, filled his double-dragoned chair.

     He glanced and saw the stately galleries,
  Dame, damsel, each through worship of their Queen
  White-robed in honour of the stainless child,
  And some with scattered jewels, like a bank
  Of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire.
  He looked but once, and vailed his eyes again.

     The sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream
  To ears but half-awaked, then one low roll
  Of Autumn thunder, and the jousts began:
  And ever the wind blew, and yellowing leaf
  And gloom and gleam, and shower and shorn plume
  Went down it.  Sighing weariedly, as one
  Who sits and gazes on a faded fire,
  When all the goodlier guests are past away,
  Sat their great umpire, looking o'er the lists.
  He saw the laws that ruled the tournament
  Broken, but spake not; once, a knight cast down
  Before his throne of arbitration cursed
  The dead babe and the follies of the King;
  And once the laces of a helmet cracked,
  And showed him, like a vermin in its hole,
  Modred, a narrow face:  anon he heard
  The voice that billowed round the barriers roar
  An ocean-sounding welcome to one knight,
  But newly-entered, taller than the rest,
  And armoured all in forest green, whereon
  There tript a hundred tiny silver deer,
  And wearing but a holly-spray for crest,
  With ever-scattering berries, and on shield
  A spear, a harp, a bugle--Tristram--late
  From overseas in Brittany returned,
  And marriage with a princess of that realm,
  Isolt the White--Sir Tristram of the Woods--
  Whom Lancelot knew, had held sometime with pain
  His own against him, and now yearned to shake
  The burthen off his heart in one full shock
  With Tristram even to death:  his strong hands gript
  And dinted the gilt dragons right and left,
  Until he groaned for wrath--so many of those,
  That ware their ladies' colours on the casque,
  Drew from before Sir Tristram to the bounds,
  And there with gibes and flickering mockeries
  Stood, while he muttered, 'Craven crests!  O shame!
  What faith have these in whom they sware to love?
  The glory of our Round Table is no more.'

     So Tristram won, and Lancelot gave, the gems,
  Not speaking other word than 'Hast thou won?
  Art thou the purest, brother?  See, the hand
  Wherewith thou takest this, is red!' to whom
  Tristram, half plagued by Lancelot's languorous mood,
  Made answer, 'Ay, but wherefore toss me this
  Like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound?
  Lest be thy fair Queen's fantasy.  Strength of heart
  And might of limb, but mainly use and skill,
  Are winners in this pastime of our King.
  My hand--belike the lance hath dript upon it--
  No blood of mine, I trow; but O chief knight,
  Right arm of Arthur in the battlefield,
  Great brother, thou nor I have made the world;
  Be happy in thy fair Queen as I in mine.'

     And Tristram round the gallery made his horse
  Caracole; then bowed his homage, bluntly saying,
  'Fair damsels, each to him who worships each
  Sole Queen of Beauty and of love, behold
  This day my Queen of Beauty is not here.'
  And most of these were mute, some angered, one
  Murmuring, 'All courtesy is dead,' and one,
  'The glory of our Round Table is no more.'

     Then fell thick rain, plume droopt and mantle clung,
  And pettish cries awoke, and the wan day
  Went glooming down in wet and weariness:
  But under her black brows a swarthy one
  Laughed shrilly, crying, 'Praise the patient saints,
  Our one white day of Innocence hath past,
  Though somewhat draggled at the skirt.  So be it.
  The snowdrop only, flowering through the year,
  Would make the world as blank as Winter-tide.
  Come--let us gladden their sad eyes, our Queen's
  And Lancelot's, at this night's solemnity
  With all the kindlier colours of the field.'

     So dame and damsel glittered at the feast
  Variously gay:  for he that tells the tale
  Likened them, saying, as when an hour of cold
  Falls on the mountain in midsummer snows,
  And all the purple slopes of mountain flowers
  Pass under white, till the warm hour returns
  With veer of wind, and all are flowers again;
  So dame and damsel cast the simple white,
  And glowing in all colours, the live grass,
  Rose-campion, bluebell, kingcup, poppy, glanced
  About the revels, and with mirth so loud
  Beyond all use, that, half-amazed, the Queen,
  And wroth at Tristram and the lawless jousts,
  Brake up their sports, then slowly to her bower
  Parted, and in her bosom pain was lord.

     And little Dagonet on the morrow morn,
  High over all the yellowing Autumn-tide,
  Danced like a withered leaf before the hall.
  Then Tristram saying, 'Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?'
  Wheeled round on either heel, Dagonet replied,
  'Belike for lack of wiser company;
  Or being fool, and seeing too much wit
  Makes the world rotten, why, belike I skip
  To know myself the wisest knight of all.'
  'Ay, fool,' said Tristram, 'but 'tis eating dry
  To dance without a catch, a roundelay
  To dance to.'  Then he twangled on his harp,
  And while he twangled little Dagonet stood
  Quiet as any water-sodden log
  Stayed in the wandering warble of a brook;
  But when the twangling ended, skipt again;
  And being asked, 'Why skipt ye not, Sir Fool?'
  Made answer, 'I had liefer twenty years
  Skip to the broken music of my brains
  Than any broken music thou canst make.'
  Then Tristram, waiting for the quip to come,
  'Good now, what music have I broken, fool?'
  And little Dagonet, skipping, 'Arthur, the King's;
  For when thou playest that air with Queen Isolt,
  Thou makest broken music with thy bride,
  Her daintier namesake down in Brittany--
  And so thou breakest Arthur's music too.'
  'Save for that broken music in thy brains,
  Sir Fool,' said Tristram, 'I would break thy head.
  Fool, I came too late, the heathen wars were o'er,
  The life had flown, we sware but by the shell--
  I am but a fool to reason with a fool--
  Come, thou art crabbed and sour:  but lean me down,
  Sir Dagonet, one of thy long asses' ears,
  And harken if my music be not true.

     '"Free love--free field--we love but while we may:
  The woods are hushed, their music is no more:
  The leaf is dead, the yearning past away:
  New leaf, new life--the days of frost are o'er:
  New life, new love, to suit the newer day:
  New loves are sweet as those that went before:
  Free love--free field--we love but while we may."

     'Ye might have moved slow-measure to my tune,
  Not stood stockstill.  I made it in the woods,
  And heard it ring as true as tested gold.'

     But Dagonet with one foot poised in his hand,
  'Friend, did ye mark that fountain yesterday
  Made to run wine?--but this had run itself
  All out like a long life to a sour end--
  And them that round it sat with golden cups
  To hand the wine to whosoever came--
  The twelve small damosels white as Innocence,
  In honour of poor Innocence the babe,
  Who left the gems which Innocence the Queen
  Lent to the King, and Innocence the King
  Gave for a prize--and one of those white slips
  Handed her cup and piped, the pretty one,
  "Drink, drink, Sir Fool," and thereupon I drank,
  Spat--pish--the cup was gold, the draught was mud.'

     And Tristram, 'Was it muddier than thy gibes?
  Is all the laughter gone dead out of thee?--
  Not marking how the knighthood mock thee, fool--
  "Fear God:  honour the King--his one true knight--
  Sole follower of the vows"--for here be they
  Who knew thee swine enow before I came,
  Smuttier than blasted grain:  but when the King
  Had made thee fool, thy vanity so shot up
  It frighted all free fool from out thy heart;
  Which left thee less than fool, and less than swine,
  A naked aught--yet swine I hold thee still,
  For I have flung thee pearls and find thee swine.'

     And little Dagonet mincing with his feet,
  'Knight, an ye fling those rubies round my neck
  In lieu of hers, I'll hold thou hast some touch
  Of music, since I care not for thy pearls.
  Swine?  I have wallowed, I have washed--the world
  Is flesh and shadow--I have had my day.
  The dirty nurse, Experience, in her kind
  Hath fouled me--an I wallowed, then I washed--
  I have had my day and my philosophies--
  And thank the Lord I am King Arthur's fool.
  Swine, say ye? swine, goats, asses, rams and geese
  Trooped round a Paynim harper once, who thrummed
  On such a wire as musically as thou
  Some such fine song--but never a king's fool.'

     And Tristram, 'Then were swine, goats, asses, geese
  The wiser fools, seeing thy Paynim bard
  Had such a mastery of his mystery
  That he could harp his wife up out of hell.'

     Then Dagonet, turning on the ball of his foot,
  'And whither harp'st thou thine? down! and thyself
  Down! and two more:  a helpful harper thou,
  That harpest downward!  Dost thou know the star
  We call the harp of Arthur up in heaven?'

     And Tristram, 'Ay, Sir Fool, for when our King
  Was victor wellnigh day by day, the knights,
  Glorying in each new glory, set his name
  High on all hills, and in the signs of heaven.'

     And Dagonet answered, 'Ay, and when the land
  Was freed, and the Queen false, ye set yourself
  To babble about him, all to show your wit--
  And whether he were King by courtesy,
  Or King by right--and so went harping down
  The black king's highway, got so far, and grew
  So witty that ye played at ducks and drakes
  With Arthur's vows on the great lake of fire.
  Tuwhoo! do ye see it? do ye see the star?'

     'Nay, fool,' said Tristram, 'not in open day.'
  And Dagonet, 'Nay, nor will:  I see it and hear.
  It makes a silent music up in heaven,
  And I, and Arthur and the angels hear,
  And then we skip.'  'Lo, fool,' he said, 'ye talk
  Fool's treason:  is the King thy brother fool?'
  Then little Dagonet clapt his hands and shrilled,
  'Ay, ay, my brother fool, the king of fools!
  Conceits himself as God that he can make
  Figs out of thistles, silk from bristles, milk
  From burning spurge, honey from hornet-combs,
  And men from beasts--Long live the king of fools!'

     And down the city Dagonet danced away;
  But through the slowly-mellowing avenues
  And solitary passes of the wood
  Rode Tristram toward Lyonnesse and the west.
  Before him fled the face of Queen Isolt
  With ruby-circled neck, but evermore
  Past, as a rustle or twitter in the wood
  Made dull his inner, keen his outer eye
  For all that walked, or crept, or perched, or flew.
  Anon the face, as, when a gust hath blown,
  Unruffling waters re-collect the shape
  Of one that in them sees himself, returned;
  But at the slot or fewmets of a deer,
  Or even a fallen feather, vanished again.

     So on for all that day from lawn to lawn
  Through many a league-long bower he rode.  At length
  A lodge of intertwisted beechen-boughs
  Furze-crammed, and bracken-rooft, the which himself
  Built for a summer day with Queen Isolt
  Against a shower, dark in the golden grove
  Appearing, sent his fancy back to where
  She lived a moon in that low lodge with him:
  Till Mark her lord had past, the Cornish King,
  With six or seven, when Tristram was away,
  And snatched her thence; yet dreading worse than shame
  Her warrior Tristram, spake not any word,
  But bode his hour, devising wretchedness.

     And now that desert lodge to Tristram lookt
  So sweet, that halting, in he past, and sank
  Down on a drift of foliage random-blown;
  But could not rest for musing how to smoothe
  And sleek his marriage over to the Queen.
  Perchance in lone Tintagil far from all
  The tonguesters of the court she had not heard.
  But then what folly had sent him overseas
  After she left him lonely here? a name?
  Was it the name of one in Brittany,
  Isolt, the daughter of the King?  'Isolt
  Of the white hands' they called her:  the sweet name
  Allured him first, and then the maid herself,
  Who served him well with those white hands of hers,
  And loved him well, until himself had thought
  He loved her also, wedded easily,
  But left her all as easily, and returned.
  The black-blue Irish hair and Irish eyes
  Had drawn him home--what marvel? then he laid
  His brows upon the drifted leaf and dreamed.

     He seemed to pace the strand of Brittany
  Between Isolt of Britain and his bride,
  And showed them both the ruby-chain, and both
  Began to struggle for it, till his Queen
  Graspt it so hard, that all her hand was red.
  Then cried the Breton, 'Look, her hand is red!
  These be no rubies, this is frozen blood,
  And melts within her hand--her hand is hot
  With ill desires, but this I gave thee, look,
  Is all as cool and white as any flower.'
  Followed a rush of eagle's wings, and then
  A whimpering of the spirit of the child,
  Because the twain had spoiled her carcanet.

     He dreamed; but Arthur with a hundred spears
  Rode far, till o'er the illimitable reed,
  And many a glancing plash and sallowy isle,
  The wide-winged sunset of the misty marsh
  Glared on a huge machicolated tower
  That stood with open doors, whereout was rolled
  A roar of riot, as from men secure
  Amid their marshes, ruffians at their ease
  Among their harlot-brides, an evil song.
  'Lo there,' said one of Arthur's youth, for there,
  High on a grim dead tree before the tower,
  A goodly brother of the Table Round
  Swung by the neck:  and on the boughs a shield
  Showing a shower of blood in a field noir,
  And therebeside a horn, inflamed the knights
  At that dishonour done the gilded spur,
  Till each would clash the shield, and blow the horn.
  But Arthur waved them back.  Alone he rode.
  Then at the dry harsh roar of the great horn,
  That sent the face of all the marsh aloft
  An ever upward-rushing storm and cloud
  Of shriek and plume, the Red Knight heard, and all,
  Even to tipmost lance and topmost helm,
  In blood-red armour sallying, howled to the King,

     'The teeth of Hell flay bare and gnash thee flat!--
  Lo! art thou not that eunuch-hearted King
  Who fain had clipt free manhood from the world--
  The woman-worshipper?  Yea, God's curse, and I!
  Slain was the brother of my paramour
  By a knight of thine, and I that heard her whine
  And snivel, being eunuch-hearted too,
  Sware by the scorpion-worm that twists in hell,
  And stings itself to everlasting death,
  To hang whatever knight of thine I fought
  And tumbled.  Art thou King? --Look to thy life!'

     He ended:  Arthur knew the voice; the face
  Wellnigh was helmet-hidden, and the name
  Went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind.
  And Arthur deigned not use of word or sword,
  But let the drunkard, as he stretched from horse
  To strike him, overbalancing his bulk,
  Down from the causeway heavily to the swamp
  Fall, as the crest of some slow-arching wave,
  Heard in dead night along that table-shore,
  Drops flat, and after the great waters break
  Whitening for half a league, and thin themselves,
  Far over sands marbled with moon and cloud,
  From less and less to nothing; thus he fell
  Head-heavy; then the knights, who watched him, roared
  And shouted and leapt down upon the fallen;
  There trampled out his face from being known,
  And sank his head in mire, and slimed themselves:
  Nor heard the King for their own cries, but sprang
  Through open doors, and swording right and left
  Men, women, on their sodden faces, hurled
  The tables over and the wines, and slew
  Till all the rafters rang with woman-yells,
  And all the pavement streamed with massacre:
  Then, echoing yell with yell, they fired the tower,
  Which half that autumn night, like the live North,
  Red-pulsing up through Alioth and Alcor,
  Made all above it, and a hundred meres
  About it, as the water Moab saw
  Came round by the East, and out beyond them flushed
  The long low dune, and lazy-plunging sea.

     So all the ways were safe from shore to shore,
  But in the heart of Arthur pain was lord.

     Then, out of Tristram waking, the red dream
  Fled with a shout, and that low lodge returned,
  Mid-forest, and the wind among the boughs.
  He whistled his good warhorse left to graze
  Among the forest greens, vaulted upon him,
  And rode beneath an ever-showering leaf,
  Till one lone woman, weeping near a cross,
  Stayed him.  'Why weep ye?'  'Lord,' she said, 'my man
  Hath left me or is dead;' whereon he thought--
  'What, if she hate me now? I would not this.
  What, if she love me still? I would not that.
  I know not what I would'--but said to her,
  'Yet weep not thou, lest, if thy mate return,
  He find thy favour changed and love thee not'--
  Then pressing day by day through Lyonnesse
  Last in a roky hollow, belling, heard
  The hounds of Mark, and felt the goodly hounds
  Yelp at his heart, but turning, past and gained
  Tintagil, half in sea, and high on land,
  A crown of towers.

                    Down in a casement sat,
  A low sea-sunset glorying round her hair
  And glossy-throated grace, Isolt the Queen.
  And when she heard the feet of Tristram grind
  The spiring stone that scaled about her tower,
  Flushed, started, met him at the doors, and there
  Belted his body with her white embrace,
  Crying aloud, 'Not Mark--not Mark, my soul!
  The footstep fluttered me at first:  not he:
  Catlike through his own castle steals my Mark,
  But warrior-wise thou stridest through his halls
  Who hates thee, as I him--even to the death.
  My soul, I felt my hatred for my Mark
  Quicken within me, and knew that thou wert nigh.'
  To whom Sir Tristram smiling, 'I am here.
  Let be thy Mark, seeing he is not thine.'

     And drawing somewhat backward she replied,
  'Can he be wronged who is not even his own,
  But save for dread of thee had beaten me,
  Scratched, bitten, blinded, marred me somehow--Mark?
  What rights are his that dare not strike for them?
  Not lift a hand--not, though he found me thus!
  But harken! have ye met him? hence he went
  Today for three days' hunting--as he said--
  And so returns belike within an hour.
  Mark's way, my soul!--but eat not thou with Mark,
  Because he hates thee even more than fears;
  Nor drink:  and when thou passest any wood
  Close vizor, lest an arrow from the bush
  Should leave me all alone with Mark and hell.
  My God, the measure of my hate for Mark
  Is as the measure of my love for thee.'

     So, plucked one way by hate and one by love,
  Drained of her force, again she sat, and spake
  To Tristram, as he knelt before her, saying,
  'O hunter, and O blower of the horn,
  Harper, and thou hast been a rover too,
  For, ere I mated with my shambling king,
  Ye twain had fallen out about the bride
  Of one--his name is out of me--the prize,
  If prize she were--(what marvel--she could see)--
  Thine, friend; and ever since my craven seeks
  To wreck thee villainously:  but, O Sir Knight,
  What dame or damsel have ye kneeled to last?'

     And Tristram, 'Last to my Queen Paramount,
  Here now to my Queen Paramount of love
  And loveliness--ay, lovelier than when first
  Her light feet fell on our rough Lyonnesse,
  Sailing from Ireland.'

                        Softly laughed Isolt;
  'Flatter me not, for hath not our great Queen
  My dole of beauty trebled?' and he said,
  'Her beauty is her beauty, and thine thine,
  And thine is more to me--soft, gracious, kind--
  Save when thy Mark is kindled on thy lips
  Most gracious; but she, haughty, even to him,
  Lancelot; for I have seen him wan enow
  To make one doubt if ever the great Queen
  Have yielded him her love.'

                             To whom Isolt,
  'Ah then, false hunter and false harper, thou
  Who brakest through the scruple of my bond,
  Calling me thy white hind, and saying to me
  That Guinevere had sinned against the highest,
  And I--misyoked with such a want of man--
  That I could hardly sin against the lowest.'

     He answered, 'O my soul, be comforted!
  If this be sweet, to sin in leading-strings,
  If here be comfort, and if ours be sin,
  Crowned warrant had we for the crowning sin
  That made us happy:  but how ye greet me--fear
  And fault and doubt--no word of that fond tale--
  Thy deep heart-yearnings, thy sweet memories
  Of Tristram in that year he was away.'

     And, saddening on the sudden, spake Isolt,
  'I had forgotten all in my strong joy
  To see thee--yearnings?--ay! for, hour by hour,
  Here in the never-ended afternoon,
  O sweeter than all memories of thee,
  Deeper than any yearnings after thee
  Seemed those far-rolling, westward-smiling seas,
  Watched from this tower.  Isolt of Britain dashed
  Before Isolt of Brittany on the strand,
  Would that have chilled her bride-kiss?  Wedded her?
  Fought in her father's battles? wounded there?
  The King was all fulfilled with gratefulness,
  And she, my namesake of the hands, that healed
  Thy hurt and heart with unguent and caress--
  Well--can I wish her any huger wrong
  Than having known thee? her too hast thou left
  To pine and waste in those sweet memories.
  O were I not my Mark's, by whom all men
  Are noble, I should hate thee more than love.'

     And Tristram, fondling her light hands, replied,
  'Grace, Queen, for being loved:  she loved me well.
  Did I love her? the name at least I loved.
  Isolt?--I fought his battles, for Isolt!
  The night was dark; the true star set.  Isolt!
  The name was ruler of the dark--Isolt?
  Care not for her! patient, and prayerful, meek,
  Pale-blooded, she will yield herself to God.'

     And Isolt answered, 'Yea, and why not I?
  Mine is the larger need, who am not meek,
  Pale-blooded, prayerful.  Let me tell thee now.
  Here one black, mute midsummer night I sat,
  Lonely, but musing on thee, wondering where,
  Murmuring a light song I had heard thee sing,
  And once or twice I spake thy name aloud.
  Then flashed a levin-brand; and near me stood,
  In fuming sulphur blue and green, a fiend--
  Mark's way to steal behind one in the dark--
  For there was Mark:  "He has wedded her," he said,
  Not said, but hissed it:  then this crown of towers
  So shook to such a roar of all the sky,
  That here in utter dark I swooned away,
  And woke again in utter dark, and cried,
  "I will flee hence and give myself to God"--
  And thou wert lying in thy new leman's arms.'

     Then Tristram, ever dallying with her hand,
  'May God be with thee, sweet, when old and gray,
  And past desire!' a saying that angered her.
  '"May God be with thee, sweet, when thou art old,
  And sweet no more to me!"  I need Him now.
  For when had Lancelot uttered aught so gross
  Even to the swineherd's malkin in the mast?
  The greater man, the greater courtesy.
  Far other was the Tristram, Arthur's knight!
  But thou, through ever harrying thy wild beasts--
  Save that to touch a harp, tilt with a lance
  Becomes thee well--art grown wild beast thyself.
  How darest thou, if lover, push me even
  In fancy from thy side, and set me far
  In the gray distance, half a life away,
  Her to be loved no more?  Unsay it, unswear!
  Flatter me rather, seeing me so weak,
  Broken with Mark and hate and solitude,
  Thy marriage and mine own, that I should suck
  Lies like sweet wines:  lie to me:  I believe.
  Will ye not lie? not swear, as there ye kneel,
  And solemnly as when ye sware to him,
  The man of men, our King--My God, the power
  Was once in vows when men believed the King!
  They lied not then, who sware, and through their vows
  The King prevailing made his realm:--I say,
  Swear to me thou wilt love me even when old,
  Gray-haired, and past desire, and in despair.'

     Then Tristram, pacing moodily up and down,
  'Vows! did you keep the vow you made to Mark
  More than I mine?  Lied, say ye?  Nay, but learnt,
  The vow that binds too strictly snaps itself--
  My knighthood taught me this--ay, being snapt--
  We run more counter to the soul thereof
  Than had we never sworn.  I swear no more.
  I swore to the great King, and am forsworn.
  For once--even to the height--I honoured him.
  "Man, is he man at all?" methought, when first
  I rode from our rough Lyonnesse, and beheld
  That victor of the Pagan throned in hall--
  His hair, a sun that rayed from off a brow
  Like hillsnow high in heaven, the steel-blue eyes,
  The golden beard that clothed his lips with light--
  Moreover, that weird legend of his birth,
  With Merlin's mystic babble about his end
  Amazed me; then, his foot was on a stool
  Shaped as a dragon; he seemed to me no man,
  But Michael trampling Satan; so I sware,
  Being amazed:  but this went by-- The vows!
  O ay--the wholesome madness of an hour--
  They served their use, their time; for every knight
  Believed himself a greater than himself,
  And every follower eyed him as a God;
  Till he, being lifted up beyond himself,
  Did mightier deeds than elsewise he had done,
  And so the realm was made; but then their vows--
  First mainly through that sullying of our Queen--
  Began to gall the knighthood, asking whence
  Had Arthur right to bind them to himself?
  Dropt down from heaven? washed up from out the deep?
  They failed to trace him through the flesh and blood
  Of our old kings:  whence then? a doubtful lord
  To bind them by inviolable vows,
  Which flesh and blood perforce would violate:
  For feel this arm of mine--the tide within
  Red with free chase and heather-scented air,
  Pulsing full man; can Arthur make me pure
  As any maiden child? lock up my tongue
  From uttering freely what I freely hear?
  Bind me to one?  The wide world laughs at it.
  And worldling of the world am I, and know
  The ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour
  Woos his own end; we are not angels here
  Nor shall be:  vows--I am woodman of the woods,
  And hear the garnet-headed yaffingale
  Mock them:  my soul, we love but while we may;
  And therefore is my love so large for thee,
  Seeing it is not bounded save by love.'

     Here ending, he moved toward her, and she said,
  'Good:  an I turned away my love for thee
  To some one thrice as courteous as thyself--
  For courtesy wins woman all as well
  As valour may, but he that closes both
  Is perfect, he is Lancelot--taller indeed,
  Rosier and comelier, thou--but say I loved
  This knightliest of all knights, and cast thee back
  Thine own small saw, "We love but while we may,"
  Well then, what answer?'

                          He that while she spake,
  Mindful of what he brought to adorn her with,
  The jewels, had let one finger lightly touch
  The warm white apple of her throat, replied,
  'Press this a little closer, sweet, until--
  Come, I am hungered and half-angered--meat,
  Wine, wine--and I will love thee to the death,
  And out beyond into the dream to come.'

     So then, when both were brought to full accord,
  She rose, and set before him all he willed;
  And after these had comforted the blood
  With meats and wines, and satiated their hearts--
  Now talking of their woodland paradise,
  The deer, the dews, the fern, the founts, the lawns;
  Now mocking at the much ungainliness,
  And craven shifts, and long crane legs of Mark--
  Then Tristram laughing caught the harp, and sang:

     'Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that bend the brier!
  A star in heaven, a star within the mere!
  Ay, ay, O ay--a star was my desire,
  And one was far apart, and one was near:
  Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that bow the grass!
  And one was water and one star was fire,
  And one will ever shine and one will pass.
  Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that move the mere.'

     Then in the light's last glimmer Tristram showed
  And swung the ruby carcanet.  She cried,
  'The collar of some Order, which our King
  Hath newly founded, all for thee, my soul,
  For thee, to yield thee grace beyond thy peers.'

     'Not so, my Queen,' he said, 'but the red fruit
  Grown on a magic oak-tree in mid-heaven,
  And won by Tristram as a tourney-prize,
  And hither brought by Tristram for his last
  Love-offering and peace-offering unto thee.'

     He spoke, he turned, then, flinging round her neck,
  Claspt it, and cried, 'Thine Order, O my Queen!'
  But, while he bowed to kiss the jewelled throat,
  Out of the dark, just as the lips had touched,
  Behind him rose a shadow and a shriek--
  'Mark's way,' said Mark, and clove him through the brain.

     That night came Arthur home, and while he climbed,
  All in a death-dumb autumn-dripping gloom,
  The stairway to the hall, and looked and saw
  The great Queen's bower was dark,--about his feet
  A voice clung sobbing till he questioned it,
  'What art thou?' and the voice about his feet
  Sent up an answer, sobbing, 'I am thy fool,
  And I shall never make thee smile again.'



  Guinevere

  Queen Guinevere had fled the court, and sat
  There in the holy house at Almesbury
  Weeping, none with her save a little maid,
  A novice:  one low light betwixt them burned
  Blurred by the creeping mist, for all abroad,
  Beneath a moon unseen albeit at full,
  The white mist, like a face-cloth to the face,
  Clung to the dead earth, and the land was still.

     For hither had she fled, her cause of flight
  Sir Modred; he that like a subtle beast
  Lay couchant with his eyes upon the throne,
  Ready to spring, waiting a chance:  for this
  He chilled the popular praises of the King
  With silent smiles of slow disparagement;
  And tampered with the Lords of the White Horse,
  Heathen, the brood by Hengist left; and sought
  To make disruption in the Table Round
  Of Arthur, and to splinter it into feuds
  Serving his traitorous end; and all his aims
  Were sharpened by strong hate for Lancelot.

     For thus it chanced one morn when all the court,
  Green-suited, but with plumes that mocked the may,
  Had been, their wont, a-maying and returned,
  That Modred still in green, all ear and eye,
  Climbed to the high top of the garden-wall
  To spy some secret scandal if he might,
  And saw the Queen who sat betwixt her best
  Enid, and lissome Vivien, of her court
  The wiliest and the worst; and more than this
  He saw not, for Sir Lancelot passing by
  Spied where he couched, and as the gardener's hand
  Picks from the colewort a green caterpillar,
  So from the high wall and the flowering grove
  Of grasses Lancelot plucked him by the heel,
  And cast him as a worm upon the way;
  But when he knew the Prince though marred with dust,
  He, reverencing king's blood in a bad man,
  Made such excuses as he might, and these
  Full knightly without scorn; for in those days
  No knight of Arthur's noblest dealt in scorn;
  But, if a man were halt or hunched, in him
  By those whom God had made full-limbed and tall,
  Scorn was allowed as part of his defect,
  And he was answered softly by the King
  And all his Table.  So Sir Lancelot holp
  To raise the Prince, who rising twice or thrice
  Full sharply smote his knees, and smiled, and went:
  But, ever after, the small violence done
  Rankled in him and ruffled all his heart,
  As the sharp wind that ruffles all day long
  A little bitter pool about a stone
  On the bare coast.

                    But when Sir Lancelot told
  This matter to the Queen, at first she laughed
  Lightly, to think of Modred's dusty fall,
  Then shuddered, as the village wife who cries
  'I shudder, some one steps across my grave;'
  Then laughed again, but faintlier, for indeed
  She half-foresaw that he, the subtle beast,
  Would track her guilt until he found, and hers
  Would be for evermore a name of scorn.
  Henceforward rarely could she front in hall,
  Or elsewhere, Modred's narrow foxy face,
  Heart-hiding smile, and gray persistent eye:
  Henceforward too, the Powers that tend the soul,
  To help it from the death that cannot die,
  And save it even in extremes, began
  To vex and plague her.  Many a time for hours,
  Beside the placid breathings of the King,
  In the dead night, grim faces came and went
  Before her, or a vague spiritual fear--
  Like to some doubtful noise of creaking doors,
  Heard by the watcher in a haunted house,
  That keeps the rust of murder on the walls--
  Held her awake:  or if she slept, she dreamed
  An awful dream; for then she seemed to stand
  On some vast plain before a setting sun,
  And from the sun there swiftly made at her
  A ghastly something, and its shadow flew
  Before it, till it touched her, and she turned--
  When lo! her own, that broadening from her feet,
  And blackening, swallowed all the land, and in it
  Far cities burnt, and with a cry she woke.
  And all this trouble did not pass but grew;
  Till even the clear face of the guileless King,
  And trustful courtesies of household life,
  Became her bane; and at the last she said,
  'O Lancelot, get thee hence to thine own land,
  For if thou tarry we shall meet again,
  And if we meet again, some evil chance
  Will make the smouldering scandal break and blaze
  Before the people, and our lord the King.'
  And Lancelot ever promised, but remained,
  And still they met and met.  Again she said,
  'O Lancelot, if thou love me get thee hence.'
  And then they were agreed upon a night
  (When the good King should not be there) to meet
  And part for ever.  Vivien, lurking, heard.
  She told Sir Modred.  Passion-pale they met
  And greeted.  Hands in hands, and eye to eye,
  Low on the border of her couch they sat
  Stammering and staring.  It was their last hour,
  A madness of farewells.  And Modred brought
  His creatures to the basement of the tower
  For testimony; and crying with full voice
  'Traitor, come out, ye are trapt at last,' aroused
  Lancelot, who rushing outward lionlike
  Leapt on him, and hurled him headlong, and he fell
  Stunned, and his creatures took and bare him off,
  And all was still:  then she, 'The end is come,
  And I am shamed for ever;' and he said,
  'Mine be the shame; mine was the sin:  but rise,
  And fly to my strong castle overseas:
  There will I hide thee, till my life shall end,
  There hold thee with my life against the world.'
  She answered, 'Lancelot, wilt thou hold me so?
  Nay, friend, for we have taken our farewells.
  Would God that thou couldst hide me from myself!
  Mine is the shame, for I was wife, and thou
  Unwedded:  yet rise now, and let us fly,
  For I will draw me into sanctuary,
  And bide my doom.'  So Lancelot got her horse,
  Set her thereon, and mounted on his own,
  And then they rode to the divided way,
  There kissed, and parted weeping:  for he past,
  Love-loyal to the least wish of the Queen,
  Back to his land; but she to Almesbury
  Fled all night long by glimmering waste and weald,
  And heard the Spirits of the waste and weald
  Moan as she fled, or thought she heard them moan:
  And in herself she moaned 'Too late, too late!'
  Till in the cold wind that foreruns the morn,
  A blot in heaven, the Raven, flying high,
  Croaked, and she thought, 'He spies a field of death;
  For now the Heathen of the Northern Sea,
  Lured by the crimes and frailties of the court,
  Begin to slay the folk, and spoil the land.'

     And when she came to Almesbury she spake
  There to the nuns, and said, 'Mine enemies
  Pursue me, but, O peaceful Sisterhood,
  Receive, and yield me sanctuary, nor ask
  Her name to whom ye yield it, till her time
  To tell you:' and her beauty, grace and power,
  Wrought as a charm upon them, and they spared
  To ask it.

            So the stately Queen abode
  For many a week, unknown, among the nuns;
  Nor with them mixed, nor told her name, nor sought,
  Wrapt in her grief, for housel or for shrift,
  But communed only with the little maid,
  Who pleased her with a babbling heedlessness
  Which often lured her from herself; but now,
  This night, a rumour wildly blown about
  Came, that Sir Modred had usurped the realm,
  And leagued him with the heathen, while the King
  Was waging war on Lancelot:  then she thought,
  'With what a hate the people and the King
  Must hate me,' and bowed down upon her hands
  Silent, until the little maid, who brooked
  No silence, brake it, uttering, 'Late! so late!
  What hour, I wonder, now?' and when she drew
  No answer, by and by began to hum
  An air the nuns had taught her; 'Late, so late!'
  Which when she heard, the Queen looked up, and said,
  'O maiden, if indeed ye list to sing,
  Sing, and unbind my heart that I may weep.'
  Whereat full willingly sang the little maid.

     'Late, late, so late! and dark the night and chill!
  Late, late, so late! but we can enter still.
  Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.

     'No light had we:  for that we do repent;
  And learning this, the bridegroom will relent.
  Too late, too late! ye cannot enter now.

     'No light:  so late! and dark and chill the night!
  O let us in, that we may find the light!
  Too late, too late:  ye cannot enter now.

     'Have we not heard the bridegroom is so sweet?
  O let us in, though late, to kiss his feet!
  No, no, too late! ye cannot enter now.'

     So sang the novice, while full passionately,
  Her head upon her hands, remembering
  Her thought when first she came, wept the sad Queen.
  Then said the little novice prattling to her,
     'O pray you, noble lady, weep no more;
  But let my words, the words of one so small,
  Who knowing nothing knows but to obey,
  And if I do not there is penance given--
  Comfort your sorrows; for they do not flow
  From evil done; right sure am I of that,
  Who see your tender grace and stateliness.
  But weigh your sorrows with our lord the King's,
  And weighing find them less; for gone is he
  To wage grim war against Sir Lancelot there,
  Round that strong castle where he holds the Queen;
  And Modred whom he left in charge of all,
  The traitor--Ah sweet lady, the King's grief
  For his own self, and his own Queen, and realm,
  Must needs be thrice as great as any of ours.
  For me, I thank the saints, I am not great.
  For if there ever come a grief to me
  I cry my cry in silence, and have done.
  None knows it, and my tears have brought me good:
  But even were the griefs of little ones
  As great as those of great ones, yet this grief
  Is added to the griefs the great must bear,
  That howsoever much they may desire
  Silence, they cannot weep behind a cloud:
  As even here they talk at Almesbury
  About the good King and his wicked Queen,
  And were I such a King with such a Queen,
  Well might I wish to veil her wickedness,
  But were I such a King, it could not be.'

     Then to her own sad heart muttered the Queen,
  'Will the child kill me with her innocent talk?'
  But openly she answered, 'Must not I,
  If this false traitor have displaced his lord,
  Grieve with the common grief of all the realm?'

     'Yea,' said the maid, 'this is all woman's grief,
  That she is woman, whose disloyal life
  Hath wrought confusion in the Table Round
  Which good King Arthur founded, years ago,
  With signs and miracles and wonders, there
  At Camelot, ere the coming of the Queen.'

     Then thought the Queen within herself again,
  'Will the child kill me with her foolish prate?'
  But openly she spake and said to her,
  'O little maid, shut in by nunnery walls,
  What canst thou know of Kings and Tables Round,
  Or what of signs and wonders, but the signs
  And simple miracles of thy nunnery?'

     To whom the little novice garrulously,
  'Yea, but I know:  the land was full of signs
  And wonders ere the coming of the Queen.
  So said my father, and himself was knight
  Of the great Table--at the founding of it;
  And rode thereto from Lyonnesse, and he said
  That as he rode, an hour or maybe twain
  After the sunset, down the coast, he heard
  Strange music, and he paused, and turning--there,
  All down the lonely coast of Lyonnesse,
  Each with a beacon-star upon his head,
  And with a wild sea-light about his feet,
  He saw them--headland after headland flame
  Far on into the rich heart of the west:
  And in the light the white mermaiden swam,
  And strong man-breasted things stood from the sea,
  And sent a deep sea-voice through all the land,
  To which the little elves of chasm and cleft
  Made answer, sounding like a distant horn.
  So said my father--yea, and furthermore,
  Next morning, while he past the dim-lit woods,
  Himself beheld three spirits mad with joy
  Come dashing down on a tall wayside flower,
  That shook beneath them, as the thistle shakes
  When three gray linnets wrangle for the seed:
  And still at evenings on before his horse
  The flickering fairy-circle wheeled and broke
  Flying, and linked again, and wheeled and broke
  Flying, for all the land was full of life.
  And when at last he came to Camelot,
  A wreath of airy dancers hand-in-hand
  Swung round the lighted lantern of the hall;
  And in the hall itself was such a feast
  As never man had dreamed; for every knight
  Had whatsoever meat he longed for served
  By hands unseen; and even as he said
  Down in the cellars merry bloated things
  Shouldered the spigot, straddling on the butts
  While the wine ran:  so glad were spirits and men
  Before the coming of the sinful Queen.'

     Then spake the Queen and somewhat bitterly,
  'Were they so glad? ill prophets were they all,
  Spirits and men:  could none of them foresee,
  Not even thy wise father with his signs
  And wonders, what has fallen upon the realm?'

     To whom the novice garrulously again,
  'Yea, one, a bard; of whom my father said,
  Full many a noble war-song had he sung,
  Even in the presence of an enemy's fleet,
  Between the steep cliff and the coming wave;
  And many a mystic lay of life and death
  Had chanted on the smoky mountain-tops,
  When round him bent the spirits of the hills
  With all their dewy hair blown back like flame:
  So said my father--and that night the bard
  Sang Arthur's glorious wars, and sang the King
  As wellnigh more than man, and railed at those
  Who called him the false son of Gorlois:
  For there was no man knew from whence he came;
  But after tempest, when the long wave broke
  All down the thundering shores of Bude and Bos,
  There came a day as still as heaven, and then
  They found a naked child upon the sands
  Of dark Tintagil by the Cornish sea;
  And that was Arthur; and they fostered him
  Till he by miracle was approven King:
  And that his grave should be a mystery
  From all men, like his birth; and could he find
  A woman in her womanhood as great
  As he was in his manhood, then, he sang,
  The twain together well might change the world.
  But even in the middle of his song
  He faltered, and his hand fell from the harp,
  And pale he turned, and reeled, and would have fallen,
  But that they stayed him up; nor would he tell
  His vision; but what doubt that he foresaw
  This evil work of Lancelot and the Queen?'

     Then thought the Queen, 'Lo! they have set her on,
  Our simple-seeming Abbess and her nuns,
  To play upon me,' and bowed her head nor spake.
  Whereat the novice crying, with clasped hands,
  Shame on her own garrulity garrulously,
  Said the good nuns would check her gadding tongue
  Full often, 'and, sweet lady, if I seem
  To vex an ear too sad to listen to me,
  Unmannerly, with prattling and the tales
  Which my good father told me, check me too
  Nor let me shame my father's memory, one
  Of noblest manners, though himself would say
  Sir Lancelot had the noblest; and he died,
  Killed in a tilt, come next, five summers back,
  And left me; but of others who remain,
  And of the two first-famed for courtesy--
  And pray you check me if I ask amiss--
  But pray you, which had noblest, while you moved
  Among them, Lancelot or our lord the King?'

     Then the pale Queen looked up and answered her,
  'Sir Lancelot, as became a noble knight,
  Was gracious to all ladies, and the same
  In open battle or the tilting-field
  Forbore his own advantage, and the King
  In open battle or the tilting-field
  Forbore his own advantage, and these two
  Were the most nobly-mannered men of all;
  For manners are not idle, but the fruit
  Of loyal nature, and of noble mind.'

     'Yea,' said the maid, 'be manners such fair fruit?'
  Then Lancelot's needs must be a thousand-fold
  Less noble, being, as all rumour runs,
  The most disloyal friend in all the world.'

     To which a mournful answer made the Queen:
  'O closed about by narrowing nunnery-walls,
  What knowest thou of the world, and all its lights
  And shadows, all the wealth and all the woe?
  If ever Lancelot, that most noble knight,
  Were for one hour less noble than himself,
  Pray for him that he scape the doom of fire,
  And weep for her that drew him to his doom.'

     'Yea,' said the little novice, 'I pray for both;
  But I should all as soon believe that his,
  Sir Lancelot's, were as noble as the King's,
  As I could think, sweet lady, yours would be
  Such as they are, were you the sinful Queen.'

     So she, like many another babbler, hurt
  Whom she would soothe, and harmed where she would heal;
  For here a sudden flush of wrathful heat
  Fired all the pale face of the Queen, who cried,
  'Such as thou art be never maiden more
  For ever! thou their tool, set on to plague
  And play upon, and harry me, petty spy
  And traitress.'  When that storm of anger brake
  From Guinevere, aghast the maiden rose,
  White as her veil, and stood before the Queen
  As tremulously as foam upon the beach
  Stands in a wind, ready to break and fly,
  And when the Queen had added 'Get thee hence,'
  Fled frighted.  Then that other left alone
  Sighed, and began to gather heart again,
  Saying in herself, 'The simple, fearful child
  Meant nothing, but my own too-fearful guilt,
  Simpler than any child, betrays itself.
  But help me, heaven, for surely I repent.
  For what is true repentance but in thought--
  Not even in inmost thought to think again
  The sins that made the past so pleasant to us:
  And I have sworn never to see him more,
  To see him more.'

                   And even in saying this,
  Her memory from old habit of the mind
  Went slipping back upon the golden days
  In which she saw him first, when Lancelot came,
  Reputed the best knight and goodliest man,
  Ambassador, to lead her to his lord
  Arthur, and led her forth, and far ahead
  Of his and her retinue moving, they,
  Rapt in sweet talk or lively, all on love
  And sport and tilts and pleasure, (for the time
  Was maytime, and as yet no sin was dreamed,)
  Rode under groves that looked a paradise
  Of blossom, over sheets of hyacinth
  That seemed the heavens upbreaking through the earth,
  And on from hill to hill, and every day
  Beheld at noon in some delicious dale
  The silk pavilions of King Arthur raised
  For brief repast or afternoon repose
  By couriers gone before; and on again,
  Till yet once more ere set of sun they saw
  The Dragon of the great Pendragonship,
  That crowned the state pavilion of the King,
  Blaze by the rushing brook or silent well.

     But when the Queen immersed in such a trance,
  And moving through the past unconsciously,
  Came to that point where first she saw the King
  Ride toward her from the city, sighed to find
  Her journey done, glanced at him, thought him cold,
  High, self-contained, and passionless, not like him,
  'Not like my Lancelot'--while she brooded thus
  And grew half-guilty in her thoughts again,
  There rode an armed warrior to the doors.
  A murmuring whisper through the nunnery ran,
  Then on a sudden a cry, 'The King.'  She sat
  Stiff-stricken, listening; but when armed feet
  Through the long gallery from the outer doors
  Rang coming, prone from off her seat she fell,
  And grovelled with her face against the floor:
  There with her milkwhite arms and shadowy hair
  She made her face a darkness from the King:
  And in the darkness heard his armed feet
  Pause by her; then came silence, then a voice,
  Monotonous and hollow like a Ghost's
  Denouncing judgment, but though changed, the King's:

     'Liest thou here so low, the child of one
  I honoured, happy, dead before thy shame?
  Well is it that no child is born of thee.
  The children born of thee are sword and fire,
  Red ruin, and the breaking up of laws,
  The craft of kindred and the Godless hosts
  Of heathen swarming o'er the Northern Sea;
  Whom I, while yet Sir Lancelot, my right arm,
  The mightiest of my knights, abode with me,
  Have everywhere about this land of Christ
  In twelve great battles ruining overthrown.
  And knowest thou now from whence I come--from him
  From waging bitter war with him:  and he,
  That did not shun to smite me in worse way,
  Had yet that grace of courtesy in him left,
  He spared to lift his hand against the King
  Who made him knight:  but many a knight was slain;
  And many more, and all his kith and kin
  Clave to him, and abode in his own land.
  And many more when Modred raised revolt,
  Forgetful of their troth and fealty, clave
  To Modred, and a remnant stays with me.
  And of this remnant will I leave a part,
  True men who love me still, for whom I live,
  To guard thee in the wild hour coming on,
  Lest but a hair of this low head be harmed.
  Fear not:  thou shalt be guarded till my death.
  Howbeit I know, if ancient prophecies
  Have erred not, that I march to meet my doom.
  Thou hast not made my life so sweet to me,
  That I the King should greatly care to live;
  For thou hast spoilt the purpose of my life.
  Bear with me for the last time while I show,
  Even for thy sake, the sin which thou hast sinned.
  For when the Roman left us, and their law
  Relaxed its hold upon us, and the ways
  Were filled with rapine, here and there a deed
  Of prowess done redressed a random wrong.
  But I was first of all the kings who drew
  The knighthood-errant of this realm and all
  The realms together under me, their Head,
  In that fair Order of my Table Round,
  A glorious company, the flower of men,
  To serve as model for the mighty world,
  And be the fair beginning of a time.
  I made them lay their hands in mine and swear
  To reverence the King, as if he were
  Their conscience, and their conscience as their King,
  To break the heathen and uphold the Christ,
  To ride abroad redressing human wrongs,
  To speak no slander, no, nor listen to it,
  To honour his own word as if his God's,
  To lead sweet lives in purest chastity,
  To love one maiden only, cleave to her,
  And worship her by years of noble deeds,
  Until they won her; for indeed I knew
  Of no more subtle master under heaven
  Than is the maiden passion for a maid,
  Not only to keep down the base in man,
  But teach high thought, and amiable words
  And courtliness, and the desire of fame,
  And love of truth, and all that makes a man.
  And all this throve before I wedded thee,
  Believing, "lo mine helpmate, one to feel
  My purpose and rejoicing in my joy."
  Then came thy shameful sin with Lancelot;
  Then came the sin of Tristram and Isolt;
  Then others, following these my mightiest knights,
  And drawing foul ensample from fair names,
  Sinned also, till the loathsome opposite
  Of all my heart had destined did obtain,
  And all through thee! so that this life of mine
  I guard as God's high gift from scathe and wrong,
  Not greatly care to lose; but rather think
  How sad it were for Arthur, should he live,
  To sit once more within his lonely hall,
  And miss the wonted number of my knights,
  And miss to hear high talk of noble deeds
  As in the golden days before thy sin.
  For which of us, who might be left, could speak
  Of the pure heart, nor seem to glance at thee?
  And in thy bowers of Camelot or of Usk
  Thy shadow still would glide from room to room,
  And I should evermore be vext with thee
  In hanging robe or vacant ornament,
  Or ghostly footfall echoing on the stair.
  For think not, though thou wouldst not love thy lord,
  Thy lord hast wholly lost his love for thee.
  I am not made of so slight elements.
  Yet must I leave thee, woman, to thy shame.
  I hold that man the worst of public foes
  Who either for his own or children's sake,
  To save his blood from scandal, lets the wife
  Whom he knows false, abide and rule the house:
  For being through his cowardice allowed
  Her station, taken everywhere for pure,
  She like a new disease, unknown to men,
  Creeps, no precaution used, among the crowd,
  Makes wicked lightnings of her eyes, and saps
  The fealty of our friends, and stirs the pulse
  With devil's leaps, and poisons half the young.
  Worst of the worst were that man he that reigns!
  Better the King's waste hearth and aching heart
  Than thou reseated in thy place of light,
  The mockery of my people, and their bane.'

     He paused, and in the pause she crept an inch
  Nearer, and laid her hands about his feet.
  Far off a solitary trumpet blew.
  Then waiting by the doors the warhorse neighed
  At a friend's voice, and he spake again:

     'Yet think not that I come to urge thy crimes,
  I did not come to curse thee, Guinevere,
  I, whose vast pity almost makes me die
  To see thee, laying there thy golden head,
  My pride in happier summers, at my feet.
  The wrath which forced my thoughts on that fierce law,
  The doom of treason and the flaming death,
  (When first I learnt thee hidden here) is past.
  The pang--which while I weighed thy heart with one
  Too wholly true to dream untruth in thee,
  Made my tears burn--is also past--in part.
  And all is past, the sin is sinned, and I,
  Lo! I forgive thee, as Eternal God
  Forgives:  do thou for thine own soul the rest.
  But how to take last leave of all I loved?
  O golden hair, with which I used to play
  Not knowing! O imperial-moulded form,
  And beauty such as never woman wore,
  Until it became a kingdom's curse with thee--
  I cannot touch thy lips, they are not mine,
  But Lancelot's:  nay, they never were the King's.
  I cannot take thy hand:  that too is flesh,
  And in the flesh thou hast sinned; and mine own flesh,
  Here looking down on thine polluted, cries
  "I loathe thee:" yet not less, O Guinevere,
  For I was ever virgin save for thee,
  My love through flesh hath wrought into my life
  So far, that my doom is, I love thee still.
  Let no man dream but that I love thee still.
  Perchance, and so thou purify thy soul,
  And so thou lean on our fair father Christ,
  Hereafter in that world where all are pure
  We two may meet before high God, and thou
  Wilt spring to me, and claim me thine, and know
  I am thine husband--not a smaller soul,
  Nor Lancelot, nor another.  Leave me that,
  I charge thee, my last hope.  Now must I hence.
  Through the thick night I hear the trumpet blow:
  They summon me their King to lead mine hosts
  Far down to that great battle in the west,
  Where I must strike against the man they call
  My sister's son--no kin of mine, who leagues
  With Lords of the White Horse, heathen, and knights,
  Traitors--and strike him dead, and meet myself
  Death, or I know not what mysterious doom.
  And thou remaining here wilt learn the event;
  But hither shall I never come again,
  Never lie by thy side; see thee no more--
  Farewell!'

            And while she grovelled at his feet,
  She felt the King's breath wander o'er her neck,
  And in the darkness o'er her fallen head,
  Perceived the waving of his hands that blest.

     Then, listening till those armed steps were gone,
  Rose the pale Queen, and in her anguish found
  The casement:  'peradventure,' so she thought,
  'If I might see his face, and not be seen.'
  And lo, he sat on horseback at the door!
  And near him the sad nuns with each a light
  Stood, and he gave them charge about the Queen,
  To guard and foster her for evermore.
  And while he spake to these his helm was lowered,
  To which for crest the golden dragon clung
  Of Britain; so she did not see the face,
  Which then was as an angel's, but she saw,
  Wet with the mists and smitten by the lights,
  The Dragon of the great Pendragonship
  Blaze, making all the night a steam of fire.
  And even then he turned; and more and more
  The moony vapour rolling round the King,
  Who seemed the phantom of a Giant in it,
  Enwound him fold by fold, and made him gray
  And grayer, till himself became as mist
  Before her, moving ghostlike to his doom.

     Then she stretched out her arms and cried aloud
  'Oh Arthur!' there her voice brake suddenly,
  Then--as a stream that spouting from a cliff
  Fails in mid air, but gathering at the base
  Re-makes itself, and flashes down the vale--
  Went on in passionate utterance:

                                  'Gone--my lord!
  Gone through my sin to slay and to be slain!
  And he forgave me, and I could not speak.
  Farewell?  I should have answered his farewell.
  His mercy choked me.  Gone, my lord the King,
  My own true lord! how dare I call him mine?
  The shadow of another cleaves to me,
  And makes me one pollution:  he, the King,
  Called me polluted:  shall I kill myself?
  What help in that?  I cannot kill my sin,
  If soul be soul; nor can I kill my shame;
  No, nor by living can I live it down.
  The days will grow to weeks, the weeks to months
  The months will add themselves and make the years,
  The years will roll into the centuries,
  And mine will ever be a name of scorn.
  I must not dwell on that defeat of fame.
  Let the world be; that is but of the world.
  What else? what hope? I think there was a hope,
  Except he mocked me when he spake of hope;
  His hope he called it; but he never mocks,
  For mockery is the fume of little hearts.
  And blessed be the King, who hath forgiven
  My wickedness to him, and left me hope
  That in mine own heart I can live down sin
  And be his mate hereafter in the heavens
  Before high God.  Ah great and gentle lord,
  Who wast, as is the conscience of a saint
  Among his warring senses, to thy knights--
  To whom my false voluptuous pride, that took
  Full easily all impressions from below,
  Would not look up, or half-despised the height
  To which I would not or I could not climb--
  I thought I could not breathe in that fine air
  That pure severity of perfect light--
  I yearned for warmth and colour which I found
  In Lancelot--now I see thee what thou art,
  Thou art the highest and most human too,
  Not Lancelot, nor another.  Is there none
  Will tell the King I love him though so late?
  Now--ere he goes to the great Battle? none:
  Myself must tell him in that purer life,
  But now it were too daring.  Ah my God,
  What might I not have made of thy fair world,
  Had I but loved thy highest creature here?
  It was my duty to have loved the highest:
  It surely was my profit had I known:
  It would have been my pleasure had I seen.
  We needs must love the highest when we see it,
  Not Lancelot, nor another.'

                             Here her hand
  Grasped, made her vail her eyes:  she looked and saw
  The novice, weeping, suppliant, and said to her,
  'Yea, little maid, for am I not forgiven?'
  Then glancing up beheld the holy nuns
  All round her, weeping; and her heart was loosed
  Within her, and she wept with these and said,

     'Ye know me then, that wicked one, who broke
  The vast design and purpose of the King.
  O shut me round with narrowing nunnery-walls,
  Meek maidens, from the voices crying "shame."
  I must not scorn myself:  he loves me still.
  Let no one dream but that he loves me still.
  So let me, if you do not shudder at me,
  Nor shun to call me sister, dwell with you;
  Wear black and white, and be a nun like you,
  Fast with your fasts, not feasting with your feasts;
  Grieve with your griefs, not grieving at your joys,
  But not rejoicing; mingle with your rites;
  Pray and be prayed for; lie before your shrines;
  Do each low office of your holy house;
  Walk your dim cloister, and distribute dole
  To poor sick people, richer in His eyes
  Who ransomed us, and haler too than I;
  And treat their loathsome hurts and heal mine own;
  And so wear out in almsdeed and in prayer
  The sombre close of that voluptuous day,
  Which wrought the ruin of my lord the King.'

     She said:  they took her to themselves; and she
  Still hoping, fearing 'is it yet too late?'
  Dwelt with them, till in time their Abbess died.
  Then she, for her good deeds and her pure life,
  And for the power of ministration in her,
  And likewise for the high rank she had borne,
  Was chosen Abbess, there, an Abbess, lived
  For three brief years, and there, an Abbess, past
  To where beyond these voices there is peace.



  The Passing of Arthur

  That story which the bold Sir Bedivere,
  First made and latest left of all the knights,
  Told, when the man was no more than a voice
  In the white winter of his age, to those
  With whom he dwelt, new faces, other minds.

     For on their march to westward, Bedivere,
  Who slowly paced among the slumbering host,
  Heard in his tent the moanings of the King:

     'I found Him in the shining of the stars,
  I marked Him in the flowering of His fields,
  But in His ways with men I find Him not.
  I waged His wars, and now I pass and die.
  O me! for why is all around us here
  As if some lesser god had made the world,
  But had not force to shape it as he would,
  Till the High God behold it from beyond,
  And enter it, and make it beautiful?
  Or else as if the world were wholly fair,
  But that these eyes of men are dense and dim,
  And have not power to see it as it is:
  Perchance, because we see not to the close;--
  For I, being simple, thought to work His will,
  And have but stricken with the sword in vain;
  And all whereon I leaned in wife and friend
  Is traitor to my peace, and all my realm
  Reels back into the beast, and is no more.
  My God, thou hast forgotten me in my death;
  Nay--God my Christ--I pass but shall not die.'

     Then, ere that last weird battle in the west,
  There came on Arthur sleeping, Gawain killed
  In Lancelot's war, the ghost of Gawain blown
  Along a wandering wind, and past his ear
  Went shrilling, 'Hollow, hollow all delight!
  Hail, King! tomorrow thou shalt pass away.
  Farewell! there is an isle of rest for thee.
  And I am blown along a wandering wind,
  And hollow, hollow, hollow all delight.'
  And fainter onward, like wild birds that change
  Their season in the night and wail their way
  From cloud to cloud, down the long wind the dream
  Shrilled; but in going mingled with dim cries
  Far in the moonlit haze among the hills,
  As of some lonely city sacked by night,
  When all is lost, and wife and child with wail
  Pass to new lords; and Arthur woke and called,
  'Who spake?  A dream.  O light upon the wind,
  Thine, Gawain, was the voice--are these dim cries
  Thine? or doth all that haunts the waste and wild
  Mourn, knowing it will go along with me?'

     This heard the bold Sir Bedivere and spake:
  'O me, my King, let pass whatever will,
  Elves, and the harmless glamour of the field;
  But in their stead thy name and glory cling
  To all high places like a golden cloud
  For ever:  but as yet thou shalt not pass.
  Light was Gawain in life, and light in death
  Is Gawain, for the ghost is as the man;
  And care not thou for dreams from him, but rise--
  I hear the steps of Modred in the west,
  And with him many of thy people, and knights
  Once thine, whom thou hast loved, but grosser grown
  Than heathen, spitting at their vows and thee.
  Right well in heart they know thee for the King.
  Arise, go forth and conquer as of old.'

     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
  'Far other is this battle in the west
  Whereto we move, than when we strove in youth,
  And brake the petty kings, and fought with Rome,
  Or thrust the heathen from the Roman wall,
  And shook him through the north.  Ill doom is mine
  To war against my people and my knights.
  The king who fights his people fights himself.
  And they my knights, who loved me once, the stroke
  That strikes them dead is as my death to me.
  Yet let us hence, and find or feel a way
  Through this blind haze, which ever since I saw
  One lying in the dust at Almesbury,
  Hath folded in the passes of the world.'

     Then rose the King and moved his host by night,
  And ever pushed Sir Modred, league by league,
  Back to the sunset bound of Lyonnesse--
  A land of old upheaven from the abyss
  By fire, to sink into the abyss again;
  Where fragments of forgotten peoples dwelt,
  And the long mountains ended in a coast
  Of ever-shifting sand, and far away
  The phantom circle of a moaning sea.
  There the pursuer could pursue no more,
  And he that fled no further fly the King;
  And there, that day when the great light of heaven
  Burned at his lowest in the rolling year,
  On the waste sand by the waste sea they closed.
  Nor ever yet had Arthur fought a fight
  Like this last, dim, weird battle of the west.
  A deathwhite mist slept over sand and sea:
  Whereof the chill, to him who breathed it, drew
  Down with his blood, till all his heart was cold
  With formless fear; and even on Arthur fell
  Confusion, since he saw not whom he fought.
  For friend and foe were shadows in the mist,
  And friend slew friend not knowing whom he slew;
  And some had visions out of golden youth,
  And some beheld the faces of old ghosts
  Look in upon the battle; and in the mist
  Was many a noble deed, many a base,
  And chance and craft and strength in single fights,
  And ever and anon with host to host
  Shocks, and the splintering spear, the hard mail hewn,
  Shield-breakings, and the clash of brands, the crash
  Of battleaxes on shattered helms, and shrieks
  After the Christ, of those who falling down
  Looked up for heaven, and only saw the mist;
  And shouts of heathen and the traitor knights,
  Oaths, insults, filth, and monstrous blasphemies,
  Sweat, writhings, anguish, labouring of the lungs
  In that close mist, and cryings for the light,
  Moans of the dying, and voices of the dead.

     Last, as by some one deathbed after wail
  Of suffering, silence follows, or through death
  Or deathlike swoon, thus over all that shore,
  Save for some whisper of the seething seas,
  A dead hush fell; but when the dolorous day
  Grew drearier toward twilight falling, came
  A bitter wind, clear from the North, and blew
  The mist aside, and with that wind the tide
  Rose, and the pale King glanced across the field
  Of battle:  but no man was moving there;
  Nor any cry of Christian heard thereon,
  Nor yet of heathen; only the wan wave
  Brake in among dead faces, to and fro
  Swaying the helpless hands, and up and down
  Tumbling the hollow helmets of the fallen,
  And shivered brands that once had fought with Rome,
  And rolling far along the gloomy shores
  The voice of days of old and days to be.

     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere,
  And whiter than the mist that all day long
  Had held the field of battle was the King:

     'Hearest thou this great voice that shakes the world,
  And wastes the narrow realm whereon we move,
  And beats upon the faces of the dead,
  My dead, as though they had not died for me?--
  O Bedivere, for on my heart hath fallen
  Confusion, till I know not what I am,
  Nor whence I am, nor whether I be King.
  Behold, I seem but King among the dead.'

     Then spake the bold Sir Bedivere:  'My King,
  King everywhere! and so the dead have kings,
  There also will I worship thee as King.
  Yet still thy life is whole, and still I live
  Who love thee; but who hates thee, he that brought
  The heathen back among us, yonder stands,
  Modred, unharmed, the traitor of thine house.'

     Then spake the King:  'My house hath been my doom.
  But call not thou this traitor of my house
  Who hath but dwelt beneath one roof with me.
  My house are rather they who sware my vows,
  Yea, even while they brake them, owned me King.
  And well for thee, saying in my dark hour,
  When all the purport of my throne hath failed,
  That quick or dead thou holdest me for King.
  King am I, whatsoever be their cry;
  And one last act of kinghood shalt thou see
  Yet, ere I pass.'  And uttering this the King
  Made at the man:  then Modred smote his liege
  Hard on that helm which many a heathen sword
  Had beaten thin; while Arthur at one blow,
  Striking the last stroke with Excalibur,
  Slew him, and all but slain himself, he fell.

     So all day long the noise of battle rolled
  Among the mountains by the winter sea;
  Until King Arthur's Table, man by man,
  Had fallen in Lyonnesse about their lord,
  King Arthur.  Then, because his wound was deep,
  The bold Sir Bedivere uplifted him,
  And bore him to a chapel nigh the field,
  A broken chancel with a broken cross,
  That stood on a dark strait of barren land:
  On one side lay the Ocean, and on one
  Lay a great water, and the moon was full.

     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
  'The sequel of today unsolders all
  The goodliest fellowship of famous knights
  Whereof this world holds record.  Such a sleep
  They sleep--the men I loved.  I think that we
  Shall never more, at any future time,
  Delight our souls with talk of knightly deeds,
  Walking about the gardens and the halls
  Of Camelot, as in the days that were.
  I perish by this people which I made,--
  Though Merlin sware that I should come again
  To rule once more; but, let what will be, be,
  I am so deeply smitten through the helm
  That without help I cannot last till morn.
  Thou therefore take my brand Excalibur,
  Which was my pride:  for thou rememberest how
  In those old days, one summer noon, an arm
  Rose up from out the bosom of the lake,
  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,
  Holding the sword--and how I rowed across
  And took it, and have worn it, like a king;
  And, wheresoever I am sung or told
  In aftertime, this also shall be known:
  But now delay not:  take Excalibur,
  And fling him far into the middle mere:
  Watch what thou seest, and lightly bring me word.'

     To him replied the bold Sir Bedivere:
  'It is not meet, Sir King, to leave thee thus,
  Aidless, alone, and smitten through the helm--
  A little thing may harm a wounded man;
  Yet I thy hest will all perform at full,
  Watch what I see, and lightly bring thee word.'

     So saying, from the ruined shrine he stept,
  And in the moon athwart the place of tombs,
  Where lay the mighty bones of ancient men,
  Old knights, and over them the sea-wind sang
  Shrill, chill, with flakes of foam.  He, stepping down
  By zigzag paths, and juts of pointed rock,
  Came on the shining levels of the lake.

     There drew he forth the brand Excalibur,
  And o'er him, drawing it, the winter moon,
  Brightening the skirts of a long cloud, ran forth
  And sparkled keen with frost against the hilt:
  For all the haft twinkled with diamond sparks,
  Myriads of topaz-lights, and jacinth-work
  Of subtlest jewellery.  He gazed so long
  That both his eyes were dazzled as he stood,
  This way and that dividing the swift mind,
  In act to throw:  but at the last it seemed
  Better to leave Excalibur concealed
  There in the many-knotted waterflags,
  That whistled stiff and dry about the marge.
  So strode he back slow to the wounded King.

     Then spake King Arthur to Sir Bedivere:
  'Hast thou performed my mission which I gave?
  What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?'

     And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
  'I heard the ripple washing in the reeds,
  And the wild water lapping on the crag.'

     To whom replied King Arthur, faint and pale:
  'Thou hast betrayed thy nature and thy name,
  Not rendering true answer, as beseemed
  Thy fealty, nor like a noble knight:
  For surer sign had followed, either hand,
  Or voice, or else a motion of the mere.
  This is a shameful thing for men to lie.
  Yet now, I charge thee, quickly go again,
  As thou art lief and dear, and do the thing
  I bade thee, watch, and lightly bring me word.'

     Then went Sir Bedivere the second time
  Across the ridge, and paced beside the mere,
  Counting the dewy pebbles, fixed in thought;
  But when he saw the wonder of the hilt,
  How curiously and strangely chased, he smote
  His palms together, and he cried aloud:

     'And if indeed I cast the brand away,
  Surely a precious thing, one worthy note,
  Should thus be lost for ever from the earth,
  Which might have pleased the eyes of many men.
  What good should follow this, if this were done?
  What harm, undone?  Deep harm to disobey,
  Seeing obedience is the bond of rule.
  Were it well to obey then, if a king demand
  An act unprofitable, against himself?
  The King is sick, and knows not what he does.
  What record, or what relic of my lord
  Should be to aftertime, but empty breath
  And rumours of a doubt?  But were this kept,
  Stored in some treasure-house of mighty kings,
  Some one might show it at a joust of arms,
  Saying, "King Arthur's sword, Excalibur,
  Wrought by the lonely maiden of the Lake.
  Nine years she wrought it, sitting in the deeps
  Upon the hidden bases of the hills."
  So might some old man speak in the aftertime
  To all the people, winning reverence.
  But now much honour and much fame were lost.'

     So spake he, clouded with his own conceit,
  And hid Excalibur the second time,
  And so strode back slow to the wounded King.

     Then spoke King Arthur, breathing heavily:
  'What is it thou hast seen? or what hast heard?'

     And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
  'I heard the water lapping on the crag,
  And the long ripple washing in the reeds.'

     To whom replied King Arthur, much in wrath:
  'Ah, miserable and unkind, untrue,
  Unknightly, traitor-hearted!  Woe is me!
  Authority forgets a dying king,
  Laid widowed of the power in his eye
  That bowed the will.  I see thee what thou art,
  For thou, the latest-left of all my knights,
  In whom should meet the offices of all,
  Thou wouldst betray me for the precious hilt;
  Either from lust of gold, or like a girl
  Valuing the giddy pleasure of the eyes.
  Yet, for a man may fail in duty twice,
  And the third time may prosper, get thee hence:
  But, if thou spare to fling Excalibur,
  I will arise and slay thee with my hands.'

     Then quickly rose Sir Bedivere, and ran,
  And, leaping down the ridges lightly, plunged
  Among the bulrush beds, and clutched the sword,
  And strongly wheeled and threw it.  The great brand
  Made lightnings in the splendour of the moon,
  And flashing round and round, and whirled in an arch,
  Shot like a streamer of the northern morn,
  Seen where the moving isles of winter shock
  By night, with noises of the Northern Sea.
  So flashed and fell the brand Excalibur:
  But ere he dipt the surface, rose an arm
  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,
  And caught him by the hilt, and brandished him
  Three times, and drew him under in the mere.
  And lightly went the other to the King.

     Then spoke King Arthur, drawing thicker breath:
  'Now see I by thine eyes that this is done.
  Speak out:  what is it thou hast heard, or seen?'

     And answer made the bold Sir Bedivere:
  'Sir King, I closed mine eyelids, lest the gems
  Should blind my purpose, for I never saw,
  Nor shall see, here or elsewhere, till I die,
  Not though I live three lives of mortal men,
  So great a miracle as yonder hilt.
  Then with both hands I flung him, wheeling him;
  But when I looked again, behold an arm,
  Clothed in white samite, mystic, wonderful,
  That caught him by the hilt, and brandished him
  Three times, and drew him under in the mere.'

     And answer made King Arthur, breathing hard:
  'My end draws nigh; 'tis time that I were gone.
  Make broad thy shoulders to receive my weight,
  And bear me to the margin; yet I fear
  My wound hath taken cold, and I shall die.'

     So saying, from the pavement he half rose,
  Slowly, with pain, reclining on his arm,
  And looking wistfully with wide blue eyes
  As in a picture.  Him Sir Bedivere
  Remorsefully regarded through his tears,
  And would have spoken, but he found not words;
  Then took with care, and kneeling on one knee,
  O'er both his shoulders drew the languid hands,
  And rising bore him through the place of tombs.

     But, as he walked, King Arthur panted hard,
  Like one that feels a nightmare on his bed
  When all the house is mute.  So sighed the King,
  Muttering and murmuring at his ear, 'Quick, quick!
  I fear it is too late, and I shall die.'

     But the other swiftly strode from ridge to ridge,
  Clothed with his breath, and looking, as he walked,
  Larger than human on the frozen hills.
  He heard the deep behind him, and a cry
  Before.  His own thought drove him like a goad.
  Dry clashed his harness in the icy caves
  And barren chasms, and all to left and right
  The bare black cliff clanged round him, as he based
  His feet on juts of slippery crag that rang
  Sharp-smitten with the dint of armed heels--
  And on a sudden, lo! the level lake,
  And the long glories of the winter moon.

     Then saw they how there hove a dusky barge,
  Dark as a funeral scarf from stem to stern,
  Beneath them; and descending they were ware
  That all the decks were dense with stately forms,
  Black-stoled, black-hooded, like a dream--by these
  Three Queens with crowns of gold:  and from them rose
  A cry that shivered to the tingling stars,
  And, as it were one voice, an agony
  Of lamentation, like a wind that shrills
  All night in a waste land, where no one comes,
  Or hath come, since the making of the world.

     Then murmured Arthur, 'Place me in the barge.'
  So to the barge they came.  There those three Queens
  Put forth their hands, and took the King, and wept.
  But she, that rose the tallest of them all
  And fairest, laid his head upon her lap,
  And loosed the shattered casque, and chafed his hands,
  And called him by his name, complaining loud,
  And dropping bitter tears against a brow
  Striped with dark blood:  for all his face was white
  And colourless, and like the withered moon
  Smote by the fresh beam of the springing east;
  And all his greaves and cuisses dashed with drops
  Of onset; and the light and lustrous curls--
  That made his forehead like a rising sun
  High from the dais-throne--were parched with dust;
  Or, clotted into points and hanging loose,
  Mixed with the knightly growth that fringed his lips.
  So like a shattered column lay the King;
  Not like that Arthur who, with lance in rest,
  From spur to plume a star of tournament,
  Shot through the lists at Camelot, and charged
  Before the eyes of ladies and of kings.

     Then loudly cried the bold Sir Bedivere:
  'Ah! my Lord Arthur, whither shall I go?
  Where shall I hide my forehead and my eyes?
  For now I see the true old times are dead,
  When every morning brought a noble chance,
  And every chance brought out a noble knight.
  Such times have been not since the light that led
  The holy Elders with the gift of myrrh.
  But now the whole Round Table is dissolved
  Which was an image of the mighty world,
  And I, the last, go forth companionless,
  And the days darken round me, and the years,
  Among new men, strange faces, other minds.'

     And slowly answered Arthur from the barge:
  'The old order changeth, yielding place to new,
  And God fulfils himself in many ways,
  Lest one good custom should corrupt the world.
  Comfort thyself:  what comfort is in me?
  I have lived my life, and that which I have done
  May He within himself make pure! but thou,
  If thou shouldst never see my face again,
  Pray for my soul.  More things are wrought by prayer
  Than this world dreams of.  Wherefore, let thy voice
  Rise like a fountain for me night and day.
  For what are men better than sheep or goats
  That nourish a blind life within the brain,
  If, knowing God, they lift not hands of prayer
  Both for themselves and those who call them friend?
  For so the whole round earth is every way
  Bound by gold chains about the feet of God.
  But now farewell.  I am going a long way
  With these thou seest--if indeed I go
  (For all my mind is clouded with a doubt)--
  To the island-valley of Avilion;
  Where falls not hail, or rain, or any snow,
  Nor ever wind blows loudly; but it lies
  Deep-meadowed, happy, fair with orchard lawns
  And bowery hollows crowned with summer sea,
  Where I will heal me of my grievous wound.'

     So said he, and the barge with oar and sail
  Moved from the brink, like some full-breasted swan
  That, fluting a wild carol ere her death,
  Ruffles her pure cold plume, and takes the flood
  With swarthy webs.  Long stood Sir Bedivere
  Revolving many memories, till the hull
  Looked one black dot against the verge of dawn,
  And on the mere the wailing died away.

     But when that moan had past for evermore,
  The stillness of the dead world's winter dawn
  Amazed him, and he groaned, 'The King is gone.'
  And therewithal came on him the weird rhyme,
  'From the great deep to the great deep he goes.'

     Whereat he slowly turned and slowly clomb
  The last hard footstep of that iron crag;
  Thence marked the black hull moving yet, and cried,
  'He passes to be King among the dead,
  And after healing of his grievous wound
  He comes again; but--if he come no more--
  O me, be yon dark Queens in yon black boat,
  Who shrieked and wailed, the three whereat we gazed
  On that high day, when, clothed with living light,
  They stood before his throne in silence, friends
  Of Arthur, who should help him at his need?'

     Then from the dawn it seemed there came, but faint
  As from beyond the limit of the world,
  Like the last echo born of a great cry,
  Sounds, as if some fair city were one voice
  Around a king returning from his wars.

     Thereat once more he moved about, and clomb
  Even to the highest he could climb, and saw,
  Straining his eyes beneath an arch of hand,
  Or thought he saw, the speck that bare the King,
  Down that long water opening on the deep
  Somewhere far off, pass on and on, and go
  From less to less and vanish into light.
  And the new sun rose bringing the new year.



  To the Queen

  O loyal to the royal in thyself,
  And loyal to thy land, as this to thee--
  Bear witness, that rememberable day,
  When, pale as yet, and fever-worn, the Prince
  Who scarce had plucked his flickering life again
  From halfway down the shadow of the grave,
  Past with thee through thy people and their love,
  And London rolled one tide of joy through all
  Her trebled millions, and loud leagues of man
  And welcome! witness, too, the silent cry,
  The prayer of many a race and creed, and clime--
  Thunderless lightnings striking under sea
  From sunset and sunrise of all thy realm,
  And that true North, whereof we lately heard
  A strain to shame us 'keep you to yourselves;
  So loyal is too costly! friends--your love
  Is but a burthen:  loose the bond, and go.'
  Is this the tone of empire? here the faith
  That made us rulers? this, indeed, her voice
  And meaning, whom the roar of Hougoumont
  Left mightiest of all peoples under heaven?
  What shock has fooled her since, that she should speak
  So feebly? wealthier--wealthier--hour by hour!
  The voice of Britain, or a sinking land,
  Some third-rate isle half-lost among her seas?
  There rang her voice, when the full city pealed
  Thee and thy Prince!  The loyal to their crown
  Are loyal to their own far sons, who love
  Our ocean-empire with her boundless homes
  For ever-broadening England, and her throne
  In our vast Orient, and one isle, one isle,
  That knows not her own greatness:  if she knows
  And dreads it we are fallen. --But thou, my Queen,
  Not for itself, but through thy living love
  For one to whom I made it o'er his grave
  Sacred, accept this old imperfect tale,
  New-old, and shadowing Sense at war with Soul,
  Ideal manhood closed in real man,
  Rather than that gray king, whose name, a ghost,
  Streams like a cloud, man-shaped, from mountain peak,
  And cleaves to cairn and cromlech still; or him
  Of Geoffrey's book, or him of Malleor's, one
  Touched by the adulterous finger of a time
  That hovered between war and wantonness,
  And crownings and dethronements:  take withal
  Thy poet's blessing, and his trust that Heaven
  Will blow the tempest in the distance back
  From thine and ours:  for some are scared, who mark,
  Or wisely or unwisely, signs of storm,
  Waverings of every vane with every wind,
  And wordy trucklings to the transient hour,
  And fierce or careless looseners of the faith,
  And Softness breeding scorn of simple life,
  Or Cowardice, the child of lust for gold,
  Or Labour, with a groan and not a voice,
  Or Art with poisonous honey stolen from France,
  And that which knows, but careful for itself,
  And that which knows not, ruling that which knows
  To its own harm:  the goal of this great world
  Lies beyond sight:  yet--if our slowly-grown
  And crowned Republic's crowning common-sense,
  That saved her many times, not fail--their fears
  Are morning shadows huger than the shapes
  That cast them, not those gloomier which forego
  The darkness of that battle in the West,
  Where all of high and holy dies away.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

LADY CLARE

It was the time when lilies blow,
And clouds are highest up in air.
Lord Ronald brought a lily-white doe
To give his cousin, Lady Clare.

I trow they did not part in scorn:
Lovers long betrothed were they;
They two will wed the morrow morn;
God's blessing on the day!

"He does not love me for my birth
Nor for my lands so broad and fair;
He loves me for my own true worth,
And that is well," said Lady Clare.

In there came old Alice the nurse,
Said, "Who was this that went from thee?"
"It was my cousin," said Lady Clare;
"To-morrow he weds with me."

"Oh, God be thanked!" said Alice the nurse,
"That all comes round so just and fair:
Lord Ronald is heir of all your lands,
And you are not the Lady Clare."

"Are ye out of your mind, my nurse, my nurse,"
Said Lady Clare, "that ye speak so wild?"
"As God's above," said Alice the nurse,
"I speak the truth: you are my child.

The old earl's daughter died at my breast;
I speak the truth, as I live by bread!
I buried her like my own sweet child,
And put my child in her stead."

"Falsely, falsely have ye done,
O mother," she said, "if this be true,
To keep the best man under the sun
So many years from his due."

"Nay now, my child," said Alice the nurse,
"But keep the secret for your life,
And all you have will be Lord Ronald's,
When you are man and wife."

"If I'm a beggar born," she said
"I will speak out, for I dare not lie,
Pull off, pull off the brooch of gold,
And fling the diamond necklace by."

"Nay now, my child," said Alice the nurse,
"But keep the secret all you can."
She said, "Not so; but I will know
If there be any faith in man."

"Nay now, what faith?" said Alice the nurse,
"The man will cleave unto his right."
"And he shall have it," the lady replied,
"Though I should die to-night."

"Yet give one kiss to your mother, dear!
Alas, my child! I sinned for thee."
"O mother, mother, mother," she said,
"So strange it seems to me!

"Yet here's a kiss for my mother dear,
My mother dear, if this be so,
And lay your hand upon my head,
And bless me, mother, ere I go."

She clad herself in a russen gown,
She was no longer Lady Clare:
She went by dale, and she went by down,
With a single rose in her hair.

The lily-white doe Lord Ronald had brought
Leapt up from where she lay.
Dropped her head in the maiden's hand.
And followed her all the way.

Down stepped Lord Ronald from his tower:
"O Lady Clare, you shame your worth!
Why come you dressed like a village maid,
That are the flower of the earth?"

"If I come dressed like a village maid,
I am but as my fortunes are:
I am a beggar born," she said,
"And not the Lady Clare."

"Play me no tricks," said Lord Ronald,
"For I am yours in word and in deed;
Play me no tricks," said Lord Ronald,
"Your riddle is hard to read."

Oh, and proudly stood she up!
Her heart within her did not fail:
She looked into Lord Ronald's eyes,
And told him all her nurse's tale.

He laughed a laugh of merry scorn:
He turned and kissed her where she stood;
"If you are not the heiress born,
And I," said he, "the next in blood--

"If you are not the heiress born,
And I," said he, "the lawful heir,
We two will wed to-morrow morn,
And you shall still be Lady Clare."

QUEEN MARY.




ACT I.


SCENE I.--ALDGATE RICHLY DECORATED.

CROWD. MARSHALMEN.


MARSHALMAN. Stand back, keep a clear lane! When will her Majesty pass,
sayst thou? why now, even now; wherefore draw back your heads and your
horns before I break them, and make what noise you will with your
tongues, so it be not treason. Long live Queen Mary, the lawful and
legitimate daughter of Harry the Eighth! Shout, knaves!

CITIZENS. Long live Queen Mary!

FIRST CITIZEN. That's a hard word, legitimate; what does it mean?

SECOND CITIZEN. It means a bastard.

THIRD CITIZEN. Nay, it means true-born.

FIRST CITIZEN. Why, didn't the Parliament make her a bastard?

SECOND CITIZEN.  No; it was the Lady Elizabeth.

THIRD CITIZEN. That was after, man; that was after.

FIRST CITIZEN. Then which is the bastard?

SECOND CITIZEN. Troth, they be both bastards by Act of Parliament and
Council.

THIRD CITIZEN. Ay, the Parliament can make every true-born man of us a
bastard. Old Nokes, can't it make thee a bastard? thou shouldst know,
for thou art as white as three Christmasses.

OLD NOKES (_dreamily_). Who's a-passing? King Edward or King Richard?

THIRD CITIZEN. No, old Nokes.

OLD NOKES. It's Harry!

THIRD CITIZEN. It's Queen Mary.

OLD NOKES. The blessed Mary's a-passing!
                                 [_Falls on his knees_.

NOKES. Let father alone, my masters! he's past your questioning.

THIRD CITIZEN. Answer thou for him, then thou'rt no such cockerel
thyself, for thou was born i' the tail end of old Harry the Seventh.

NOKES. Eh! that was afore bastard-making began. I was born true man at
five in the forenoon  i' the tail of old Harry, and so they can't make
me a bastard.

THIRD CITIZEN. But if Parliament can make the Queen a bastard, why, it
follows all the more that they can make thee one, who art fray'd i'
the knees, and out at elbow, and bald o' the back, and bursten at the
toes, and down at heels.

NOKES. I was born of a true man and a ring'd wife, and I can't argue
upon it; but I and my old woman 'ud burn upon it, that would we.

MARSHALMAN. What are you cackling of bastardy under the Queen's own
nose? I'll have you flogg'd and burnt too, by the Rood I will.

FIRST CITIZEN. He swears by the Rood. Whew!

SECOND CITIZEN. Hark! the trumpets.

    [_The Procession passes_, MARY _and_ ELIZABETH _riding
    side by side, and disappears under the gate_.

CITIZENS. Long live Queen Mary! down with all traitors! God save her
Grace; and death to Northumberland!
                            [_Exeunt_.

    _Manent_ TWO GENTLEMEN.

FIRST GENTLEMAN. By God's light a noble creature, right royal!

SECOND GENTLEMAN. She looks comelier than ordinary to-day; but to my
mind the Lady Elizabeth is the more noble and royal.

FIRST GENTLEMAN. I mean the Lady Elizabeth. Did you hear (I have a
daughter in her service who reported it) that she met the Queen at
Wanstead with five hundred horse, and the Queen (tho' some say they be
much divided) took her hand, call'd her sweet sister, and kiss'd not
her alone, but all the ladies of her following.

SECOND GENTLEMAN. Ay, that was in her hour of joy; there will be
plenty to sunder and unsister them again: this Gardiner for one, who
is to be made Lord Chancellor, and will pounce like a wild beast out
of his cage to worry Cranmer.

FIRST GENTLEMAN. And furthermore, my daughter said that when there
rose a talk of the late rebellion, she spoke even of Northumberland
pitifully, and of the good Lady Jane as a poor innocent child who had
but obeyed her father; and furthermore, she said that no one in her
time should be burnt for heresy.

SECOND GENTLEMAN. Well, sir, I look for happy times.

FIRST GENTLEMAN. There is but one thing against them. I know not if
you know.

SECOND GENTLEMAN. I suppose you touch upon the rumour that Charles,
the master of the world, has offer'd her his son Philip, the Pope and
the Devil. I trust it is but a rumour.

FIRST GENTLEMAN. She is going now to the Tower to loose the prisoners
there, and among them Courtenay, to be made Earl of Devon, of royal
blood, of splendid feature, whom the council and all her people wish
her to marry. May it be so, for we are many of us Catholics, but few
Papists, and the Hot Gospellers will go mad upon it.

SECOND GENTLEMAN. Was she not betroth'd in her babyhood to the Great
Emperor himself?

FIRST GENTLEMAN. Ay, but he's too old.

SECOND GENTLEMAN. And again to her cousin Reginald Pole, now Cardinal;
but I hear that he too is full of aches and broken before his day.

FIRST GENTLEMAN. O, the Pope could dispense with his Cardinalate, and
his achage, and his breakage,  if that were all: will you not follow
the procession?

SECOND GENTLEMAN. No; I have seen enough for this day.

FIRST GENTLEMAN. Well, I shall follow; if I can get near enough I
shall judge with my own eyes whether her Grace incline to this
splendid scion of Plantagenet.

                                       [_Exeunt_.



SCENE II.--A ROOM IN LAMBETH PALACE.


CRANMER. To Strasburg, Antwerp, Frankfort, Zurich, Worms,
Geneva, Basle--our Bishops from their sees
Or fled, they say, or flying--Poinet, Barlow,
Bale, Scory, Coverdale; besides the Deans
Of Christchurch, Durham, Exeter, and Wells--
Ailmer and Bullingham, and hundreds more;
So they report: I shall be left alone.
No: Hooper, Ridley, Latimer will not fly.

    _Enter_ PETER MARTYR.

PETER MARTYR. Fly, Cranmer! were there nothing else, your name
Stands first of those who sign'd the Letters Patent
That gave her royal crown to Lady Jane.

CRANMER.
Stand first it may, but it was written last:
Those that are now her Privy Council, sign'd
Before me: nay, the Judges had pronounced
That our young Edward might bequeath the crown
Of England, putting by his father's will.
Yet I stood out, till Edward sent for me.
The wan boy-king, with his fast-fading eyes
Fixt hard on mine, his frail transparent hand,
Damp with the sweat of death, and griping mine,
Whisper'd me, if I loved him, not to yield
His Church of England to the Papal wolf
And Mary; then I could no more--I sign'd.
Nay, for bare shame of inconsistency,
She cannot pass her traitor council by,
To make me headless.

PETER MARTYR.        That might be forgiven.
I tell you, fly, my Lord. You do not own
The bodily presence in the Eucharist,
Their wafer and perpetual sacrifice:
Your creed will be your death.

CRANMER.                       Step after step,
Thro' many voices crying right and left,
Have I climb'd back into the primal church,
And stand within the porch, and Christ with me:
My flight were such a scandal to the faith,
The downfall of so many simple souls,
I dare not leave my post.

PETER MARTYR.             But you divorced
Queen Catharine and her father; hence, her hate
Will burn till you are burn'd.

CRANMER.                       I cannot help it.
The Canonists and Schoolmen were with me.
'Thou shalt not wed thy brother's wife.'--'Tis written,
'They shall be childless.' True, Mary was born,
But France would not accept her for a bride
As being born from incest; and this wrought
Upon the king; and child by child, you know,
Were momentary sparkles out as quick
Almost as kindled; and he brought his doubts
And fears to me. Peter, I'll swear for him
He _did_ believe the bond incestuous.
But wherefore am I trenching on the time
That should already have seen your steps a mile
From me and Lambeth? God be with you! Go.

PETER MARTYR. Ah, but how fierce a letter you wrote against
Their superstition when they slander'd you
For setting up a mass at Canterbury
To please the Queen.

CRANMER.             It was a wheedling monk
Set up the mass.

PETER MARTYR.    I know it, my good Lord.
But you so bubbled over with hot terms
Of Satan, liars, blasphemy, Antichrist,
She never will forgive you. Fly, my Lord, fly!

CRANMER. I wrote it, and God grant me power to burn!

PETER MARTYR. They have given me a safe conduct: for all that
I dare not stay. I fear, I fear, I see you,
Dear friend, for the last time; farewell, and fly.

CRANMER. Fly and farewell, and let me die the death.
                                       [_Exit_ PETER MARTYR.

    _Enter_ OLD SERVANT.

O, kind and gentle master, the Queen's Officers
Are here in force to take you to the Tower.

CRANMER. Ay, gentle friend, admit them. I will go.
I thank my God it is too late to fly.

                                [_Exeunt_.



SCENE III.--ST. PAUL'S CROSS.

FATHER BOURNE _in the pulpit_. A CROWD. MARCHIONESS OF EXETER,
COURTENAY. _The_ SIEUR DE NOAILLES _and his man_ ROGER _in front
of the stage. Hubbub_.


NOAILLES. Hast thou let fall those papers in the  palace?

ROGER. Ay, sir.

NOAILLES.       'There will be no peace for Mary till
Elizabeth lose her head.'

ROGER.                    Ay, sir.

NOAILLES. And the other, 'Long live Elizabeth the Queen!'

ROGER. Ay, sir; she needs must tread upon them.

NOAILLES.                                       Well.
These beastly swine make such a grunting here,
I cannot catch what Father Bourne is saying.

ROGER. Quiet a moment, my masters; hear what the shaveling has to say
for himself.

CROWD. Hush--hear!

BOURNE.--and so this unhappy land, long divided in itself, and
sever'd from the faith, will return into the one true fold, seeing
that our gracious Virgin Queen hath----

CROWD. No pope! no pope!

ROGER (_to those about him, mimicking_ BOURNE).--hath sent for the
holy legate of the holy father the Pope, Cardinal Pole, to give us all
that holy absolution which----

FIRST CITIZEN. Old Bourne to the life!

SECOND CITIZEN. Holy absolution! holy Inquisition!

THIRD CITIZEN. Down with the Papist!
                                        [_Hubbub_.

BOURNE.--and now that your good bishop,
Bonner, who hath lain so long under bonds for the
faith--
                                        [_Hubbub_.

NOAILLES. Friend Roger, steal thou in among the crowd,
And get the swine to shout Elizabeth.
Yon gray old Gospeller, sour as midwinter,
Begin with him.

ROGER (_goes_). By the mass, old friend, we'll have no pope here while
the Lady Elizabeth lives.

GOSPELLER. Art thou of the true faith, fellow, that swearest by the
mass?

ROGER. Ay, that am I, new converted, but the old leaven sticks to my
tongue yet.

FIRST CITIZEN. He says right; by the mass we'll have no mass here.

VOICES OF THE CROWD. Peace! hear him; let his own words damn the
Papist. From thine own mouth I judge thee--tear him down!

BOURNE.--and since our Gracious Queen, let me call her our second
Virgin Mary, hath begun to re-edify the true temple----,

FIRST CITIZEN. Virgin Mary! we'll have no virgins here--we'll have the
Lady Elizabeth!

    [_Swords are drawn, a knife is hurled and sticks in
    the pulpit. The mob throng to the pulpit stairs_.

MARCHIONESS OF EXETER. Son Courtenay, wilt thou see the holy father
Murdered before thy face? up, son, and save him! They love thee, and
thou canst not come to harm.

COURTENAY (_in the pulpit_). Shame, shame, my masters! are you
English-born, And set yourselves by hundreds against one?

CROWD. A Courtenay! a Courtenay!

    [_A train of Spanish servants crosses at the back of the stage_.

NOAILLES. These birds of passage come before their time:
Stave off the crowd upon the Spaniard there.

ROGER. My masters, yonder's fatter game for you
Than this old gaping gurgoyle: look you there--
The Prince of Spain coming to wed our Queen!
After him, boys! and pelt him from the city.

    [_They seize stones and follow the Spaniards.
    Exeunt on the other side_ MARCHIONESS OF
    EXETER _and_ ATTENDANTS.

NOAILLES (_to_ ROGER).
Stand from me. If Elizabeth lose her head--
That makes for France.
And if her people, anger'd thereupon,
Arise against her and dethrone the Queen--
That makes for France.
And if I breed confusion anyway--
That makes for France.
                       Good-day, my Lord of Devon;
A bold heart yours to beard that raging mob!

COURTENAY. My mother said, Go up; and up I went.
I knew they would not do me any wrong,
For I am mighty popular with them, Noailles.

NOAILLES. You look'd a king.

COURTENAY.                   Why not? I am king's blood.

NOAILLES. And in the whirl of change may come to be one.

COURTENAY. Ah!

NOAILLES. But does your gracious Queen entreat you kinglike?

COURTENAY. 'Fore God, I think she entreats me like a child.

NOAILLES. You've but a dull life in this maiden court, I fear, my
Lord?

COURTENAY. A life of nods and yawns.

NOAILLES. So you would honour my poor house to-night,
We might enliven you. Divers honest fellows,
The Duke of Suffolk lately freed from prison,
Sir Peter Carew and Sir Thomas Wyatt,
Sir Thomas Stafford, and some more--we play.

COURTENAY. At what?

NOAILLES.           The Game of Chess.

COURTENAY.                             The Game of Chess!
I can play well, and I shall beat you there.

NOAILLES. Ay, but we play with Henry, King of France,
And certain of his court.
His Highness makes his moves across the Channel,
We answer him with ours, and there are messengers
That go between us.

COURTENAY. Why, such a game, sir, were whole years a playing.

NOAILLES. Nay; not so long I trust. That all depends
Upon the skill and swiftness of the players.

COURTENAY. The King is skilful at it?

NOAILLES.                             Very, my Lord.

COURTENAY. And the stakes high?

NOAILLES.         But not beyond your means.

COURTENAY. Well, I'm the first of players, I shall win.

NOAILLES. With our advice and in our company,
And so you well attend to the king's moves,
I think you may.

COURTENAY. When do you meet?

NOAILLES.                    To-night.

COURTENAY (_aside_).
I will be there; the fellow's at his tricks--
Deep--I shall fathom him. (_Aloud_) Good morning,
Noailles.
             [_Exit_ COURTENAY.

NOAILLES. Good-day, my Lord. Strange game of chess! a King
That with her own pawns plays against a Queen,
Whose play is all to find herself a King.
Ay; but this fine blue-blooded Courtenay seems
Too princely for a pawn. Call him a Knight,
That, with an ass's, not a horse's head,
Skips every way, from levity or from fear.
Well, we shall use him somehow, so that Gardiner
And Simon Renard spy not out our game
Too early. Roger, thinkest thou that anyone
Suspected thee to be my man?

ROGER.                       Not one, sir.

NOAILLES. No! the disguise was perfect. Let's away.
                                              [_Exeunt_.



SCENE IV.--LONDON. A ROOM IN THE PALACE.
ELIZABETH. _Enter_ COURTENAY.


COURTENAY. So yet am I,
Unless my friends and mirrors lie to me,
A goodlier-looking fellow than this Philip.
Pah!
The Queen is ill advised: shall I turn traitor?
They've almost talked me into it: yet the word
Affrights me somewhat: to be such a one
As Harry Bolingbroke hath a lure in it.
Good now, my Lady Queen, tho' by your age,
And by your looks you are not worth the having,
Yet by your crown you are.    [_Seeing_ ELIZABETH.
                           The Princess there?
If I tried her and la--she's amorous.
Have we not heard of her in Edward's time,
Her freaks and frolics with the late Lord Admiral?
I do believe she'd yield. I should be still
A party in the state; and then, who knows--

ELIZABETH. What are you musing on, my Lord of Devon?

COURTENAY. Has not the Queen--

ELIZABETH.                    Done what, Sir?

COURTENAY.                                   --made you follow
The Lady Suffolk and the Lady Lennox?--
You,
The heir presumptive.

ELIZABETH.            Why do you ask? you know it.

COURTENAY. You needs must bear it hardly.

ELIZABETH.                                No, indeed!
I am utterly submissive to the Queen.

COURTENAY. Well, I was musing upon that; the Queen
Is both my foe and yours: we should be friends.

ELIZABETH. My Lord, the hatred of another to us
Is no true bond of friendship.

COURTENAY.                     Might it not
Be the rough preface of some closer bond?

ELIZABETH. My Lord, you late were loosed from out the Tower,
Where, like a butterfly in a chrysalis,
You spent your life; that broken, out you flutter
Thro' the new world, go zigzag, now would settle
Upon this flower, now that; but all things here
At court are known; you have solicited
The Queen, and been rejected.

COURTENAY.                    Flower, she!
Half faded! but you, cousin, are fresh and sweet
As the first flower no bee has ever tried.

ELIZABETH. Are you the bee to try me? why, but now
I called you butterfly.

COURTENAY.              You did me wrong,
I love not to be called a butterfly:
Why do you call me butterfly?

ELIZABETH. Why do you go so gay then?

COURTENAY.                            Velvet and gold.
This dress was made me as the Earl of Devon
To take my seat in; looks it not right royal?

ELIZABETH. So royal that the Queen forbad you wearing it.

COURTENAY. I wear it then to spite her.

ELIZABETH.                              My Lord, my Lord;
I see you in the Tower again. Her Majesty
Hears you affect the Prince--prelates kneel to
you.--

COURTENAY. I am the noblest blood in Europe, Madam,
A Courtenay of Devon, and her cousin.

ELIZABETH. She hears you make your boast that after all
She means to wed you. Folly, my good Lord.

COURTENAY. How folly? a great party in the state
Wills me to wed her.

ELIZABETH.          Failing her, my Lord,
Doth not as great a party in the state
Will you to wed me?

COURTENAY.          Even so, fair lady.

ELIZABETH. You know to flatter ladies.

COURTENAY.                             Nay, I meant
True matters of the heart.

ELIZABETH.                 _My_ heart, my Lord,
Is no great party in the state as yet.

COURTENAY. Great, said you? nay, you shall be great. I love you,
Lay my life in your hands. Can you be close?

ELIZABETH. Can you, my Lord?

COURTENAY.                   Close as a miser's casket.
Listen:
The King of France, Noailles the Ambassador,
The Duke of Suffolk and Sir Peter Carew,
Sir Thomas Wyatt, I myself, some others,
Have sworn this Spanish marriage shall not be.
If Mary will not hear us--well--conjecture--
Were I in Devon with my wedded bride,
The people there so worship me--Your ear;
You shall be Queen.

ELIZABETH.          You speak too low, my Lord;
I cannot hear you.

COURTENAY.         I'll repeat it.

ELIZABETH.                         No!
Stand further off, or you may lose your head.

COURTENAY. I have a head to lose for your sweet
sake.

ELIZABETH. Have you, my Lord? Best keep it for your own.
Nay, pout not, cousin.
Not many friends are mine, except indeed
Among the many. I believe you mine;
And so you may continue mine, farewell,
And that at once.

    _Enter_ MARY, _behind_.

MARY. Whispering--leagued together
To bar me from my Philip.

COURTENAY.                Pray--consider--

ELIZABETH (_seeing the_ QUEEN).
Well, that's a noble horse of yours, my Lord.
I trust that he will carry you well to-day,
And heal your headache.

COURTENAY.              You are wild; what headache?
Heartache, perchance; not headache.

ELIZABETH (_aside to_ COURTENAY). Are you blind?

        [COURTENAY _sees the_ QUEEN _and exit. Exit_ MARY.


  _Enter_ LORD WILLIAM HOWARD.

HOWARD. Was that my Lord of Devon? do not you
Be seen in corners with my Lord of Devon.
He hath fallen out of favour with the Queen.
She fears the Lords may side with you and him
Against her marriage; therefore is he dangerous.
And if this Prince of fluff and feather come
To woo you, niece, he is dangerous everyway.

ELIZABETH. Not very dangerous that way, my good uncle.

HOWARD. But your own state is full of danger here.
The disaffected, heretics, reformers,
Look to you as the one to crown their ends.
Mix not yourself with any plot I pray you;
Nay, if by chance you hear of any such,
Speak not thereof--no, not to your best friend,
Lest you should be confounded with it. Still--
Perinde ac cadaver--as the priest says,
You know your Latin--quiet as a dead body.
What was my Lord of Devon telling you?

ELIZABETH. Whether he told me anything or not,
I follow your good counsel, gracious uncle.
Quiet as a dead body.

HOWARD.               You do right well.
I do not care to know; but this I charge you,
Tell Courtenay nothing. The Lord Chancellor
(I count it as a kind of virtue in him,
He hath not many), as a mastiff dog
May love a puppy cur for no more reason
Than that the twain have been tied up together,
Thus Gardiner--for the two were fellow-prisoners
So many years in yon accursed Tower--
Hath taken to this Courtenay. Look to it, niece,
He hath no fence when Gardiner questions him;
All oozes out; yet him--because they know him
The last White Rose, the last Plantagenet
(Nay, there is Cardinal Pole, too), the people
Claim as their natural leader--ay, some say,
That you shall marry him, make him King belike.

ELIZABETH. Do they say so, good uncle?

HOWARD.                                Ay, good niece!
You should be plain and open with me, niece.
You should not play upon me.

ELIZABETH.                   No, good uncle.

    _Enter_ GARDINER.

GARDINER. The Queen would see your Grace upon the moment.

ELIZABETH. Why, my lord Bishop?

GARDINER. I think she means to counsel your withdrawing
To Ashridge, or some other country house.

ELIZABETH. Why, my lord Bishop?

GARDINER. I do but bring the message, know no more.
Your Grace will hear her reasons from herself.

ELIZABETH. 'Tis mine own wish fulfill'd before the word
Was spoken, for in truth I had meant to crave
Permission of her Highness to retire
To Ashridge, and pursue my studies there.

GARDINER. Madam, to have the wish before the word
Is man's good Fairy--and the Queen is yours.
I left her with rich jewels in her hand,
Whereof 'tis like enough she means to make
A farewell present to your Grace.

ELIZABETH.                        My Lord,
I have the jewel of a loyal heart.

GARDINER. I doubt it not, Madam, most loyal.
                                  [_Bows low and exit_.

HOWARD.                                      See,
This comes of parleying with my Lord of Devon.
Well, well, you must obey; and I myself
Believe it will be better for your welfare.
Your time will come.

ELIZABETH.           I think my time will come.
Uncle,
I am of sovereign nature, that I know,
Not to be quell'd; and I have felt within me
Stirrings of some great doom when God's just hour
Peals--but this fierce old Gardiner--his big baldness,
That irritable forelock which he rubs,
His buzzard beak and deep-incavern'd eyes
Half fright me.

HOWARD.         You've a bold heart; keep it so.
He cannot touch you save that you turn traitor;
And so take heed I pray you--you are one
Who love that men should smile upon you, niece.
They'd smile you into treason--some of them.

ELIZABETH. I spy the rock beneath the smiling sea.
But if this Philip, the proud Catholic prince,
And this bald priest, and she that hates me, seek
In that lone house, to practise on my life,
By poison, fire, shot, stab--

HOWARD. They will not, niece.
Mine is the fleet and all the power at sea--
Or will be in a moment. If they dared
To harm you, I would blow this Philip and all
Your trouble to the dogstar and the devil.

ELIZABETH. To the Pleiads, uncle; they have lost
a sister.

HOWARD. But why say that? what have you done
to lose her?
Come, come, I will go with you to the Queen.

                                        [_Exeunt_.



SCENE V.--A ROOM IN THE PALACE.

MARY _with_ PHILIP'S _miniature_. ALICE.


MARY (_kissing the miniature_).
Most goodly, King-like and an Emperor's son,--
A king to be,--is he not noble, girl?

ALICE. Goodly enough, your Grace, and yet, methinks,
I have seen goodlier.

MARY.                 Ay; some waxen doll
Thy baby eyes have rested on, belike;
All red and white, the fashion of our land.
But my good mother came (God rest her soul)
Of Spain, and I am Spanish in myself,
And in my likings.

ALICE.             By your Grace's leave
Your royal mother came of Spain, but took
To the English red and white. Your royal father
(For so they say) was all pure lily and rose
In his youth, and like a lady.

MARY.                          O, just God!
Sweet mother, you had time and cause enough
To sicken of his lilies and his roses.
Cast off, betray'd, defamed, divorced, forlorn!
And then the King--that traitor past forgiveness,
The false archbishop fawning on him, married
The mother of Elizabeth--a heretic
Ev'n as _she_ is; but God hath sent me here
To take such order with all heretics
That it shall be, before I die, as tho'
My father and my brother had not lived.
What wast thou saying of this Lady Jane,
Now in the Tower?

ALICE.            Why, Madam, she was passing
Some chapel down in Essex, and with her
Lady Anne Wharton, and the Lady Anne
Bow'd to the Pyx; but Lady Jane stood up
Stiff as the very backbone of heresy.
And wherefore bow ye not, says Lady Anne,
To him within there who made Heaven and Earth?
I cannot, and I dare not, tell your Grace
What Lady Jane replied.

MARY.                   But I will have it.

ALICE. She said--pray pardon me, and pity her--
She hath harken'd evil counsel--ah! she said,
The baker made him.

MARY.               Monstrous! blasphemous!
She ought to burn. Hence, thou (_Exit_ ALICE). No--being traitor
Her head will fall: shall it? she is but a child.
We do not kill the child for doing that
His father whipt him into doing--a head
So full of grace and beauty! would that mine
Were half as gracious! O, my lord to be,
My love, for thy sake only.
I am eleven years older than he is.
But will he care for that?
No, by the holy Virgin, being noble,
But love me only: then the bastard sprout,
My sister, is far fairer than myself.
Will he be drawn to her?
No, being of the true faith with myself.
Paget is for him--for to wed with Spain
Would treble England--Gardiner is against him;
The Council, people, Parliament against him;
But I will have him! My hard father hated me;
My brother rather hated me than loved;
My sister cowers and hates me. Holy Virgin,
Plead with thy blessed Son; grant me my prayer:
Give me my Philip; and we two will lead
The living waters of the Faith again
Back thro' their widow'd channel here, and watch
The parch'd banks rolling incense, as of old,
To heaven, and kindled with the palms of Christ!

    _Enter_ USHER.

Who waits, sir?

USHER.          Madam, the Lord Chancellor.

MARY. Bid him come in. (_Enter_ GARDINER.)
Good morning, my good Lord.

                               [_Exit_ USHER.

GARDINER. That every morning of your Majesty
May be most good, is every morning's prayer
Of your most loyal subject, Stephen Gardiner.

MARY. Come you to tell me this, my Lord?

GARDINER.                                And more.
Your people have begun to learn your worth.
Your pious wish to pay King Edward's debts,
Your lavish household curb'd, and the remission
Of half that subsidy levied on the people,
Make all tongues praise and all hearts beat for you.
I'd have you yet more loved: the realm is poor,
The exchequer at neap-tide: we might withdraw
Part of our garrison at Calais.

MARY.                           Calais!
Our one point on the main, the gate of France!
I am Queen of England; take mine eyes, mine heart,
But do not lose me Calais.

GARDINER.                  Do not fear it.
Of that hereafter. I say your Grace is loved.
That I may keep you thus, who am your friend
And ever faithful counsellor, might I speak?

MARY. I can forespeak your speaking. Would I marry
Prince Philip, if all England hate him? That is
Your question, and I front it with another:
Is it England, or a party? Now, your answer.

GARDINER. My answer is, I wear beneath my dress
A shirt of mail: my house hath been assaulted,
And when I walk abroad, the populace,
With fingers pointed like so many daggers,
Stab me in fancy, hissing Spain and Philip;
And when I sleep, a hundred men-at-arms
Guard my poor dreams for England. Men would murder me,
Because they think me favourer of this marriage.

MARY. And that were hard upon you, my Lord Chancellor.

GARDINER. But our young Earl of Devon--

MARY.                                  Earl of Devon?
I freed him from the Tower, placed him at Court;
I made him Earl of Devon, and--the fool--
He wrecks his health and wealth on courtesans,
And rolls himself in carrion like a dog.

GARDINER. More like a school-boy that hath broken bounds,
Sickening himself with sweets.

MARY.                          I will not hear of him.
Good, then, they will revolt: but I am Tudor,
And shall control them.

GARDINER.               I will help you, Madam,
Even to the utmost. All the church is grateful.
You have ousted the mock priest, repulpited
The shepherd of St. Peter, raised the rood again,
And brought us back the mass. I am all thanks
To God and to your Grace: yet I know well,
Your people, and I go with them so far,
Will brook nor Pope nor Spaniard here to play
The tyrant, or in commonwealth or church.

MARY (_showing the picture).
_Is this the face of one who plays the tyrant?
Peruse it; is it not goodly, ay, and gentle?

GARDINER. Madam, methinks a cold face and a haughty.
And when your Highness talks of Courtenay--
Ay, true--a goodly one. I would his life
Were half as goodly (_aside_).

MARY.               What is that you mutter?

GARDINER. Oh, Madam, take it bluntly; marry Philip,
And be stepmother of a score of sons!
The prince is known in Spain, in Flanders, ha!
For Philip--

MARY.       You offend us; you may leave us.
You see thro' warping glasses.

GARDINER.                      If your Majesty--

MARY. I have sworn upon the body and blood of Christ
I'll none but Philip.

GARDINER.             Hath your Grace so sworn?

MARY. Ay, Simon Renard knows it.

GARDINER.                        News to me!
It then remains for your poor Gardiner,
So you still care to trust him somewhat less
Than Simon Renard, to compose the event
In some such form as least may harm your Grace.

MARY. I'll have the scandal sounded to the mud.
I know it a scandal.

GARDINER. All my hope is now
It may be found a scandal.

MARY. You offend us.

GARDINER (_aside_).
These princes are like children, must be physick'd,
The bitter in the sweet. I have lost mine office,
It may be, thro' mine honesty, like a fool.
                                         [_Exit_.

    _Enter_ USHER.

MARY. Who waits?

USHER. The Ambassador from France, your Grace.

MARY (_sits down_).
Bid him come in. Good morning, Sir de Noailles.

                                      [_Exit_ USHER,

NOAILLES (_entering_).
A happy morning to your Majesty.

MARY. And I should some time have a happy morning;
I have had none yet. What says the King your master?

NOAILLES. Madam, my master hears with much alarm,
That you may marry Philip, Prince of Spain--
Foreseeing, with whate'er unwillingness,
That if this Philip be the titular king
Of England, and at war with him, your Grace
And kingdom will be suck'd into the war,
Ay, tho' you long for peace; wherefore, my master,
If but to prove your Majesty's goodwill,
Would fain have some fresh treaty drawn between you.

MARY. Why some fresh treaty? wherefore should I do it?
Sir, if we marry, we shall still maintain
All former treaties with his Majesty.
Our royal word for that! and your good master,
Pray God he do not be the first to break them,
Must be content with that; and so, farewell.

NOAILLES (_going, returns_).
I would your answer had been other, Madam,
For I foresee dark days.

MARY.                    And so do I, sir;
Your master works against me in the dark.
I do believe he holp Northumberland
Against me.

NOAILLES.   Nay, pure phantasy, your Grace.
Why should he move against you?

MARY.                           Will you hear why?
Mary of Scotland,--for I have not own'd
My sister, and I will not,--after me
Is heir of England; and my royal father,
To make the crown of Scotland one with ours,
Had mark'd her for my brother Edward's bride;
Ay, but your king stole her a babe from Scotland
In order to betroth her to your Dauphin.
See then:
Mary of Scotland, married to your Dauphin,
Would make our England, France;
Mary of England, joining hands with Spain,
Would be too strong for France.
Yea, were there issue born to her, Spain and we,
One crown, might rule the world. There lies your fear.
That is your drift. You play at hide and seek.
Show me your faces!

NOAILLES.           Madam, I am amazed:
French, I must needs wish all good things for France.
That must be pardon'd me; but I protest
Your Grace's policy hath a farther flight
Than mine into the future. We but seek
Some settled ground for peace to stand upon.

MARY. Well, we will leave all this, sir, to our council.
Have you seen Philip ever?

NOAILLES.                  Only once.

MARY. Is this like Philip?

NOAILLES.                  Ay, but nobler-looking.

MARY. Hath he the large ability of the Emperor?

NOAILLES. No, surely.

MARY. I can make allowance for thee,
Thou speakest of the enemy of thy king.

NOAILLES. Make no allowance for the naked truth.
He is every way a lesser man than Charles;
Stone-hard, ice-cold--no dash of daring in him.

MARY. If cold, his life is pure.

NOAILLES.                        Why (_smiling_), no, indeed.

MARY. Sayst thou?

NOAILLES.         A very wanton life indeed (_smiling_).

MARY. Your audience is concluded, sir.

                           [_Exit_ NOAILLES.

                                       You cannot
Learn a man's nature from his natural foe.

    _Enter_ USHER.

Who waits?

USHER.     The Ambassador of Spain, your Grace.
                                           [_Exit_.

    _Enter_ SIMON RENARD.

MARY (_rising to meet him_).
Thou art ever welcome, Simon Renard. Hast thou
Brought me the letter which thine Emperor promised
Long since, a formal offer of the hand Of Philip?

RENARD. Nay, your Grace, it hath not reach'd me.
I know not wherefore--some mischance of flood,
And broken bridge, or spavin'd horse, or wave
And wind at their old battle: he must have written.

MARY. But Philip never writes me one poor word.
Which in his absence had been all my wealth.
Strange in a wooer!

RENARD.             Yet I know the Prince,
So your king-parliament suffer him to land,
Yearns to set foot upon your island shore.

MARY. God change the pebble which his kingly foot
First presses into some more costly stone
Than ever blinded eye. I'll have one mark it
And bring it me. I'll have it burnish'd firelike;
I'll set it round with gold, with pearl, with diamond.
Let the great angel of the church come with him;
Stand on the deck and spread his wings for sail!
God lay the waves and strow the storms at sea,
And here at land among the people! O Renard,
I am much beset, I am almost in despair.
Paget is ours. Gardiner perchance is ours;
But for our heretic Parliament--

RENARD.                         O Madam,
You fly your thoughts like kites. My master, Charles,
Bad you go softly with your heretics here,
Until your throne had ceased to tremble. Then
Spit them like larks for aught I care. Besides,
When Henry broke the carcase of your church
To pieces, there were many wolves among you
Who dragg'd the scatter'd limbs into their den.
The Pope would have you make them render these;
So would your cousin, Cardinal Pole; ill counsel!
These let them keep at present; stir not yet
This matter of the Church lands. At his coming
Your star will rise.

MARY.                My star! a baleful one.
I see but the black night, and hear the wolf.
What star?

RENARD.    Your star will be your princely son,
Heir of this England and the Netherlands!
And if your wolf the while should howl for more,
We'll dust him from a bag of Spanish gold.
I do believe, I have dusted some already,
That, soon or late, your Parliament is ours.

MARY. Why do they talk so foully of your Prince,
Renard?

RENARD. The lot of Princes. To sit high
Is to be lied about.

MARY.                They call him cold,
Haughty, ay, worse.

RENARD.             Why, doubtless, Philip shows
Some of the bearing of your blue blood--still
All within measure--nay, it well becomes him.

MARY. Hath he the large ability of his father?

RENARD. Nay, some believe that he will go beyond him.

MARY. Is this like him?

RENARD.                 Ay, somewhat; but your Philip
Is the most princelike Prince beneath the sun.
This is a daub to Philip.

MARY.                     Of a pure life?

RENARD. As an angel among angels. Yea, by Heaven,
The text--Your Highness knows it, 'Whosoever
Looketh after a woman,' would not graze
The Prince of Spain. You are happy in him there,
Chaste as your Grace!

MARY.                 I am happy in him there.

RENARD. And would be altogether happy, Madam,
So that your sister were but look'd to closer.
You have sent her from the court, but then she goes,
I warrant, not to hear the nightingales,
But hatch you some new treason in the woods.

MARY. We have our spies abroad to catch her tripping,
And then if caught, to the Tower.

RENARD.                           The Tower! the block!
The word has turn'd your Highness pale; the thing
Was no such scarecrow in your father's time.
I have heard, the tongue yet quiver'd with the jest
When the head leapt--so common! I do think
To save your crown that it must come to this.

MARY. No, Renard; it must never come to this.

RENARD. Not yet; but your old Traitors of the Tower--
Why, when you put Northumberland to death,
The sentence having past upon them all,
Spared you the Duke of Suffolk, Guildford Dudley,
Ev'n that young girl who dared to wear your crown?

MARY. Dared? nay, not so; the child obey'd her father.
Spite of her tears her father forced it on her.

RENARD. Good Madam, when the Roman wish'd to reign,
He slew not him alone who wore the purple,
But his assessor in the throne, perchance
A child more innocent than Lady Jane.

MARY. I am English Queen, not Roman Emperor.

RENARD. Yet too much mercy is a want of mercy,
And wastes more life. Stamp out the fire, or this
Will smoulder and re-flame, and burn the throne
Where you should sit with Philip: he will not come
Till she be gone.

MARY.             Indeed, if that were true--
For Philip comes, one hand in mine, and one
Steadying the tremulous pillars of the Church--
But no, no, no. Farewell. I am somewhat faint
With our long talk. Tho' Queen, I am not Queen
Of mine own heart, which every now and then
Beats me half dead: yet stay, this golden chain--
My father on a birthday gave it me,
And I have broken with my father--take
And wear it as memorial of a morning
Which found me full of foolish doubts, and leaves me
As hopeful.

RENARD (_aside_). Whew--the folly of all follies
Is to be love-sick for a shadow. (_Aloud_) Madam,
This chains me to your service, not with gold,
But dearest links of love. Farewell, and trust me,
Philip is yours.
                    [_Exit_.

MARY.            Mine--but not yet all mine.

    _Enter_ USHER.

USHER. Your Council is in Session, please your Majesty.

MARY. Sir, let them sit. I must have time to breathe.
No, say I come. (_Exit_ USHER.) I won by boldness once.
The Emperor counsell'd me to fly to Flanders.
I would not; but a hundred miles I rode,
Sent out my letters, call'd my friends together,
Struck home and won.
And when the Council would not crown me--thought
To bind me first by oaths I could not keep,
And keep with Christ and conscience--was it boldness
Or weakness that won there? when I, their Queen,
Cast myself down upon my knees before them,
And those hard men brake into woman tears,
Ev'n Gardiner, all amazed, and in that passion
Gave me my Crown.

    _Enter_ ALICE.

                  Girl; hast thou ever heard
Slanders against Prince Philip in our Court?

ALICE. What slanders? I, your Grace; no, never.

MARY.                                           Nothing?

ALICE. Never, your Grace.

MARY. See that you neither hear them nor repeat!

ALICE (_aside_).
Good Lord! but I have heard a thousand such.
Ay, and repeated them as often--mum!
Why comes that old fox-Fleming back again?

    _Enter_ RENARD.

RENARD. Madam, I scarce had left your Grace's presence
Before I chanced upon the messenger
Who brings that letter which we waited for--
The formal offer of Prince Philip's hand.
It craves an instant answer, Ay or No.

MARY. An instant Ay or No! the Council sits.
Give it me quick.

ALICE (_stepping before her_).
                  Your Highness is all trembling.

MARY. Make way.    [_Exit into the Council Chamber_.

ALICE.          O, Master Renard, Master Renard,
If you have falsely painted your fine Prince;
Praised, where you should have blamed him, I pray God
No woman ever love you, Master Renard.
It breaks my heart to hear her moan at night
As tho' the nightmare never left her bed.

RENARD. My pretty maiden, tell me, did you ever
Sigh for a beard?

ALICE.            That's not a pretty question.

RENARD. Not prettily put? I mean, my pretty maiden,
A pretty man for such a pretty maiden.

ALICE. My Lord of Devon is a pretty man.
I hate him. Well, but if I have, what then?

RENARD. Then, pretty maiden, you should know that whether
A wind be warm or cold, it serves to fan
A kindled fire.

ALICE.          According to the song.

    His friends would praise him, I believed 'em,
      His foes would blame him, and I scorn'd 'em,
    His friends--as Angels I received 'em,
      His foes--the Devil had suborn'd 'em.

RENARD. Peace, pretty maiden.
I hear them stirring in the Council Chamber.
Lord Paget's 'Ay' is sure--who else? and yet,
They are all too much at odds to close at once
In one full-throated No! Her Highness comes.

    _Enter_ MARY.

ALICE. How deathly pale!--a chair, your Highness
                [_Bringing one to the_ QUEEN.

RENARD. Madam,
The Council?

MARY.        Ay! My Philip is all mine.

                  [_Sinks into chair, half fainting_.




ACT II


SCENE I.--ALINGTON CASTLE.


SIR THOMAS WYATT. I do not hear from Carew or the Duke
Of Suffolk, and till then I should not move.
The Duke hath gone to Leicester; Carew stirs
In Devon: that fine porcelain Courtenay,
Save that he fears he might be crack'd in using,
(I have known a semi-madman in my time
So fancy-ridd'n) should be in Devon too.

    _Enter_ WILLIAM.

News abroad, William?

WILLIAM. None so new, Sir Thomas, and none so old, Sir Thomas. No new
news that Philip comes to wed Mary, no old news that all men hate it.
Old Sir Thomas would have hated it. The bells are ringing at
Maidstone. Doesn't your worship hear?

WYATT. Ay, for the Saints are come to reign again.
Most like it is a Saint's-day. There's no call
As yet for me; so in this pause, before
The mine be fired, it were a pious work
To string my father's sonnets, left about
Like loosely-scatter'd jewels, in fair order,
And head them with a lamer rhyme of mine,
To grace his memory.

WILLIAM. Ay, why not, Sir Thomas? He was a fine courtier, he; Queen
Anne loved him. All the women loved him. I loved him, I was in Spain
with him. I couldn't eat in Spain, I couldn't sleep in Spain. I hate
Spain, Sir Thomas.

WYATT. But thou could'st drink in Spain if I remember.

WILLIAM. Sir Thomas, we may grant the wine. Old Sir Thomas always
granted the wine.

WYATT. Hand me the casket with my father's sonnets.

WILLIAM. Ay--sonnets--a fine courtier of the old Court, old Sir
Thomas.    [_Exit_.

WYATT. Courtier of many courts, he loved the more
His own gray towers, plain life and letter'd peace,
To read and rhyme in solitary fields,
The lark above, the nightingale below,
And answer them in song. The sire begets
Not half his likeness in the son. I fail
Where he was fullest: yet--to write it down.
                                    [_He writes_.

    _Re-enter_ WILLIAM.

WILLIAM. There _is_ news, there _is_ news, and no call for
sonnet-sorting now, nor for sonnet-making either, but ten thousand
men on Penenden Heath all calling after your worship, and your
worship's name heard into Maidstone market, and your worship the first
man in Kent and Christendom, for the Queen's down, and the world's up,
and your worship a-top of it.

WYATT. Inverted Aesop--mountain out of mouse.
Say for ten thousand ten--and pothouse knaves,
Brain-dizzied with a draught of morning ale.

    _Enter_ ANTONY KNYVETT.

WILLIAM. Here's Antony Knyvett.

KNYVETT. Look you, Master Wyatt,
Tear up that woman's work there.

WYATT.                           No; not these,
Dumb children of my father, that will speak
When I and thou and all rebellions lie
Dead bodies without voice. Song flies you know
For ages.

KNYVETT.  Tut, your sonnet's a flying ant,
Wing'd for a moment.

WYATT.               Well, for mine own work,
                                [_Tearing the paper_.
It lies there in six pieces at your feet;
For all that I can carry it in my head.

KNYVETT. If you can carry your head upon your shoulders.

WYATT. I fear you come to carry it off my shoulders,
And sonnet-making's safer.

KNYVETT.                   Why, good Lord,
Write you as many sonnets as you will.
Ay, but not now; what, have you eyes, ears, brains?
This Philip and the black-faced swarms of Spain,
The hardest, cruellest people in the world,
Come locusting upon us, eat us up,
Confiscate lands, goods, money--Wyatt, Wyatt,
Wake, or the stout old island will become
A rotten limb of Spain. They roar for you
On Penenden Heath, a thousand of them--more--
All arm'd, waiting a leader; there's no glory
Like his who saves his country: and you sit
Sing-songing here; but, if I'm any judge,
By God, you are as poor a poet, Wyatt,
As a good soldier.

WYATT.             You as poor a critic
As an honest friend: you stroke me on one cheek,
Buffet the other. Come, you bluster, Antony!
You know I know all this. I must not move
Until I hear from Carew and the Duke.
I fear the mine is fired before the time.

KNYVETT (_showing a paper_).
But here's some Hebrew. Faith, I half forgot it.
Look; can you make it English? A strange youth
Suddenly thrust it on me, whisper'd, 'Wyatt,'
And whisking round a corner, show'd his back
Before I read his face.

WYATT.                  Ha! Courtenay's cipher.    [_Reads_.
'Sir Peter Carew fled to France: it is thought the Duke will be taken.
I am with you still; but, for appearance sake, stay with the Queen.
Gardiner knows, but the Council are all at odds, and the Queen hath no
force for resistance. Move, if you move, at once.'

Is Peter Carew fled? Is the Duke taken?
Down scabbard, and out sword! and let Rebellion
Roar till throne rock, and crown fall. No; not that;
But we will teach Queen Mary how to reign.
Who are those that shout below there?

KNYVETT. Why, some fifty
That follow'd me from Penenden Heath in hope
To hear you speak.

WYATT.             Open the window, Knyvett;
The mine is fired, and I will speak to them.

Men of Kent; England of England; you that have kept your old customs
upright, while all the rest of England bow'd theirs to the Norman, the
cause that hath brought us together is not the cause of a county or a
shire, but of this England, in whose crown our Kent is the fairest
jewel. Philip shall not wed Mary; and ye have called me to be your
leader. I know Spain. I have been there with my father; I have seen
them in their own land; have marked the haughtiness of their nobles;
the cruelty of their priests. If this man marry our Queen, however
the Council and the Commons may fence round his power with restriction,
he will be King, King of England, my masters; and the Queen, and the
laws, and the people, his slaves. What? shall we have Spain on the
throne and in the parliament; Spain in the pulpit and on the law-bench;
Spain in all the great offices of state; Spain in our ships, in our
forts, in our houses, in our beds?

CROWD. No! no! no Spain!

WILLIAM. No Spain in our beds--that were worse than all. I have been
there with old Sir Thomas, and the beds I know. I hate Spain.

A PEASANT. But, Sir Thomas, must we levy war against the Queen's
Grace?

WYATT. No, my friend; war _for_ the Queen's Grace--to save her from
herself and Philip--war against Spain. And think not we shall be
alone--thousands  will flock to us. The Council, the Court itself, is
on our side. The Lord Chancellor himself is on our side. The King of
France is with us; the King of Denmark is with us; the world is with
us--war  against Spain! And if we move not now, yet it will be known
that we have moved; and if Philip come to be King, O, my God! the
rope, the rack, the thumbscrew, the stake, the fire. If we move not
now, Spain moves, bribes our nobles with her gold, and creeps, creeps
snake-like about our legs till we cannot move at all; and ye know, my
masters, that wherever Spain hath ruled she hath wither'd all beneath
her. Look at the New World--a paradise made hell; the red man, that
good helpless creature, starved, maim'd, flogg'd, flay'd, burn'd,
boil'd, buried alive, worried by dogs; and here, nearer home, the
Netherlands, Sicily, Naples, Lombardy. I say no more--only this, their
lot is yours. Forward to London with me! forward to London! If ye love
your liberties or your skins, forward to London!

CROWD. Forward to London! A Wyatt! a Wyatt!

WYATT. But first to Rochester, to take the guns
From out the vessels lying in the river.
Then on.

A PEASANT. Ay, but I fear we be too few, Sir Thomas.

WYATT. Not many yet. The world as yet, my friend,
Is not half-waked; but every parish tower
Shall clang and clash alarum as we pass,
And pour along the land, and swoll'n and fed
With indraughts and side-currents, in full force
Roll upon London.

CROWD.            A Wyatt! a Wyatt! Forward!

KNYVETT. Wyatt, shall we proclaim Elizabeth?

WYATT. I'll think upon it, Knyvett.

KNYVETT.                            Or Lady Jane?

WYATT. No, poor soul; no.
Ah, gray old castle of Alington, green field
Beside the brimming Medway, it may chance
That I shall never look upon you more.

KNYVETT. Come, now, you're sonnetting again.

WYATT.                                       Not I.
I'll have my head set higher in the state;
Or--if the Lord God will it--on the stake.

                                     [_Exeunt_.



SCENE II.--GUILDHALL.

SIR THOMAS WHITE (The Lord Mayor), LORD WILLIAM HOWARD, SIR RALPH
BAGENHALL, ALDERMEN _and_ CITIZENS.


WHITE. I trust the Queen comes hither with her guards.

HOWARD. Ay, all in arms.

        [_Several of the citizens move hastily out of the hall_.

                         Why do they hurry out there?

WHITE. My Lord, cut out the rotten from your apple,
Your apple eats the better. Let them go.
They go like those old Pharisees in John
Convicted by their conscience, arrant cowards,
Or tamperers with that treason out of Kent.
When will her Grace be here?

HOWARD.                      In some few minutes.
She will address your guilds and companies.
I have striven in vain to raise a man for her.
But help her in this exigency, make
Your city loyal, and be the mightiest man
This day in England.

WHITE.               I am Thomas White.
Few things have fail'd to which I set my will.
I do my most and best.

HOWARD.                You know that after
The Captain Brett, who went with your train bands
To fight with Wyatt, had gone over to him
With all his men, the Queen in that distress
Sent Cornwallis and Hastings to the traitor,
Feigning to treat with him about her marriage--
Know too what Wyatt said.

WHITE.                    He'd sooner be,
While this same marriage question was being argued,
Trusted than trust--the scoundrel--and demanded
Possession of her person and the Tower.

HOWARD. And four of her poor Council too, my Lord,
As hostages.

WHITE.       I know it. What do and say
Your Council at this hour?

HOWARD.                    I will trust you.
We fling ourselves on you, my Lord. The Council,
The Parliament as well, are troubled waters;
And yet like waters of the fen they know not
Which way to flow. All hangs on her address,
And upon you, Lord Mayor.

WHITE.                    How look'd the city
When now you past it? Quiet?

HOWARD.                      Like our Council,
Your city is divided. As we past,
Some hail'd, some hiss'd us. There were citizens
Stood each before his shut-up booth, and look'd
As grim and grave as from a funeral.
And here a knot of ruffians all in rags,
With execrating execrable eyes,
Glared at the citizen. Here was a young mother,
Her face on flame, her red hair all blown back,
She shrilling 'Wyatt,' while the boy she held
Mimick'd and piped her 'Wyatt,' as red as she
In hair and cheek; and almost elbowing her,
So close they stood, another, mute as death,
And white as her own milk; her babe in arms
Had felt the faltering of his mother's heart,
And look'd as bloodless. Here a pious Catholic,
Mumbling and mixing up in his scared prayers
Heaven and earth's Maries; over his bow'd shoulder
Scowl'd that world-hated and world-hating beast,
A haggard Anabaptist. Many such groups.
The names of Wyatt, Elizabeth, Courtenay,
Nay the Queen's right to reign--'fore God, the rogues--
Were freely buzzed among them. So I say
Your city is divided, and I fear
One scruple, this or that way, of success
Would turn it thither. Wherefore now the Queen
In this low pulse and palsy of the state,
Bad me to tell you that she counts on you
And on myself as her two hands; on you,
In your own city, as her right, my Lord,
For you are loyal.

WHITE.             Am I Thomas White?
One word before she comes. Elizabeth--
Her name is much abused among these traitors.
Where is she? She is loved by all of us.
I scarce have heart to mingle in this matter,
If she should be mishandled.

HOWARD.                      No; she shall not.
The Queen had written her word to come to court:
Methought I smelt out Renard in the letter,
And fearing for her, sent a secret missive,
Which told her to be sick. Happily or not,
It found her sick indeed.

WHITE.                    God send her well;
Here comes her Royal Grace.

    _Enter_ GUARDS, MARY _and_ GARDINER. SIR THOMAS
    WHITE _leads her to a raised seat on the dais_.

WHITE. I, the Lord Mayor, and these our companies
And guilds of London, gathered here, beseech
Your Highness to accept our lowliest thanks
For your most princely presence; and we pray
That we, your true and loyal citizens,
From your own royal lips, at once may know
The wherefore of this coming, and so learn
Your royal will, and do it.--I, Lord Mayor
Of London, and our guilds and companies.

MARY. In mine own person am I come to you,
To tell you what indeed ye see and know,
How traitorously these rebels out of Kent
Have made strong head against ourselves and you.
They would not have me wed the Prince of Spain:
That was their pretext--so they spake at first--
But we sent divers of our Council to them,
And by their answers to the question ask'd,
It doth appear this marriage is the least
Of all their quarrel.
They have betrayed the treason of their hearts:
Seek to possess our person, hold our Tower,
Place and displace our councillors, and use
Both us and them according as they will.
Now what I am ye know right well--your Queen;
To whom, when I was wedded to the realm
And the realm's laws (the spousal ring whereof,
Not ever to be laid aside, I wear
Upon this finger), ye did promise full
Allegiance and obedience to the death.
Ye know my father was the rightful heir
Of England, and his right came down to me
Corroborate by your acts of Parliament:
And as ye were most loving unto him,
So doubtless will ye show yourselves to me.
Wherefore, ye will not brook that anyone
Should seize our person, occupy our state,
More specially a traitor so presumptuous
As this same Wyatt, who hath tamper'd with
A public ignorance, and, under colour
Of such a cause as hath no colour, seeks
To bend the laws to his own will, and yield
Full scope to persons rascal and forlorn,
To make free spoil and havock of your goods.
Now as your Prince, I say,
I, that was never mother, cannot tell
How mothers love their children; yet, methinks,
A prince as naturally may love his people
As these their children; and be sure your Queen
So loves you, and so loving, needs must deem
This love by you return'd as heartily;
And thro' this common knot and bond of love,
Doubt not they will be speedily overthrown.
As to this marriage, ye shall understand
We made thereto no treaty of ourselves,
And set no foot theretoward unadvised
Of all our Privy Council; furthermore,
This marriage had the assent of those to whom
The king, my father, did commit his trust;
Who not alone esteem'd it honourable,
But for the wealth and glory of our realm,
And all our loving subjects, most expedient.
As to myself,
I am not so set on wedlock as to choose
But where I list, nor yet so amorous
That I must needs be husbanded; I thank God,
I have lived a virgin, and I noway doubt
But that with God's grace, I can live so still.
Yet if it might please God that I should leave
Some fruit of mine own body after me,
To be your king, ye would rejoice thereat,
And it would be your comfort, as I trust;
And truly, if I either thought or knew
This marriage should bring loss or danger to you,
My subjects, or impair in any way
This royal state of England, I would never
Consent thereto, nor marry while I live;
Moreover, if this marriage should not seem,
Before our own High Court of Parliament,
To be of rich advantage to our realm,
We will refrain, and not alone from this,
Likewise from any other, out of which
Looms the least chance of peril to our realm.
Wherefore be bold, and with your lawful Prince
Stand fast against our enemies and yours,
And fear them not. I fear them not. My Lord,
I leave Lord William Howard in your city,
To guard and keep you whole and safe from all
The spoil and sackage aim'd at by these rebels,
Who mouth and foam against the Prince of Spain.

VOICES. Long live Queen Mary!
                              Down with Wyatt!
                                               The Queen!

WHITE. Three voices from our guilds and companies!
You are shy and proud like Englishmen, my masters,
And will not trust your voices. Understand:
Your lawful Prince hath come to cast herself
On loyal hearts and bosoms, hoped to fall
Into the wide-spread arms of fealty,
And finds you statues. Speak at once--and all!
For whom?
Our sovereign Lady by King Harry's will;
The Queen of England--or the Kentish Squire?
I know you loyal. Speak! in the name of God!
The Queen of England or the rabble of Kent?
The reeking dungfork master of the mace!
Your havings wasted by the scythe and spade--
Your rights and charters hobnail'd into slush--
Your houses fired--your gutters bubbling blood--

ACCLAMATION. No! No! The Queen! the Queen!

WHITE.                                     Your Highness hears
This burst and bass of loyal harmony,
And how we each and all of us abhor
The venomous, bestial, devilish revolt
Of Thomas Wyatt. Hear us now make oath
To raise your Highness thirty thousand men,
And arm and strike as with one hand, and brush
This Wyatt from our shoulders, like a flea
That might have leapt upon us unawares.
Swear with me, noble fellow-citizens, all,
With all your trades, and guilds, and companies.

CITIZENS. We swear!

MARY. We thank your Lordship and your loyal city.
                                  [_Exit_ MARY _attended_.

WHITE. I trust this day, thro' God, I have saved the crown.

FIRST ALDERMAN. Ay, so my Lord of Pembroke in command
Of all her force be safe; but there are doubts.

SECOND ALDERMAN. I hear that Gardiner, coming with the Queen,
And meeting Pembroke, bent to his saddle-bow,
As if to win the man by flattering him.
_Is_ he so safe to fight upon her side?

FIRST ALDERMAN. If not, there's no man safe.

WHITE.                                       Yes, Thomas White.
I am safe enough; no man need flatter me.

SECOND ALDERMAN. Nay, no man need; but did you mark our Queen?
The colour freely play'd into her face,
And the half sight which makes her look so stern,
Seem'd thro' that dim dilated world of hers,
To read our faces; I have never seen her
So queenly or so goodly.

WHITE.                   Courage, sir,
_That_ makes or man or woman look their goodliest.
Die like the torn fox dumb, but never whine
Like that poor heart, Northumberland, at the block.

BAGENHALL. The man had children, and he whined for those.
Methinks most men are but poor-hearted, else
Should we so doat on courage, were it commoner?
The Queen stands up, and speaks for her own self;
And all men cry, She is queenly, she is goodly.
Yet she's no goodlier; tho' my Lord Mayor here,
By his own rule, he hath been so bold to-day,
Should look more goodly than the rest of us.

WHITE. Goodly? I feel most goodly heart and hand,
And strong to throw ten Wyatts and all Kent.
Ha! ha! sir; but you jest; I love it: a jest
In time of danger shows the pulses even.
Be merry! yet, Sir Ralph, you look but sad.
I dare avouch you'd stand up for yourself,
Tho' all the world should bay like winter wolves.

BAGENHALL. Who knows? the man is proven by the hour.

WHITE. The man should make the hour, not this the man;
And Thomas White will prove this Thomas Wyatt,
And he will prove an Iden to this Cade,
And he will play the Walworth to this Wat;
Come, sirs, we prate; hence all--gather your men--
Myself must bustle. Wyatt comes to Southwark;
I'll have the drawbridge hewn into the Thames,
And see the citizens arm'd. Good day; good day.
                                       [_Exit_ WHITE.

BAGENHALL. One of much outdoor bluster.

HOWARD.                                 For all that,
Most honest, brave, and skilful; and his wealth
A fountain of perennial alms--his fault
So thoroughly to believe in his own self.

BAGENHALL. Yet thoroughly to believe in one's own self,
So one's own self be thorough, were to do
Great things, my Lord.

HOWARD.                It may be.

BAGENHALL.                        I have heard
One of your Council fleer and jeer at him.

HOWARD. The nursery-cocker'd child will jeer at aught
That may seem strange beyond his nursery.
The statesman that shall jeer and fleer at men,
Makes enemies for himself and for his king;
And if he jeer not seeing the true man
Behind his folly, he is thrice the fool;
And if he see the man and still will jeer,
He is child and fool, and traitor to the State.
Who is he? let me shun him.

BAGENHALL.                    Nay, my Lord,
He is damn'd enough already.

HOWARD.                      I must set
The guard at Ludgate. Fare you well, Sir Ralph.

BAGENHALL. 'Who knows?' I am for England. But who knows,
That knows the Queen, the Spaniard, and the Pope,
Whether I be for Wyatt, or the Queen?

                                [_Exeunt_.



SCENE III.--LONDON BRIDGE.


    _Enter_ SIR THOMAS WYATT _and_ BRETT.

WYATT. Brett, when the Duke of Norfolk moved against us
Thou cried'st 'A Wyatt!' and flying to our side
Left his all bare, for which I love thee, Brett.
Have for thine asking aught that I can give,
For thro' thine help we are come to London Bridge;
But how to cross it balks me. I fear we cannot.

BRETT. Nay, hardly, save by boat, swimming, or wings.

WYATT. Last night I climb'd into the gate-house, Brett,
And scared the gray old porter and his wife.
And then I crept along the gloom and saw
They had hewn the drawbridge down into the river.
It roll'd as black as death; and that same tide
Which, coming with our coming, seem'd to smile
And sparkle like our fortune as thou saidest,
Ran sunless down, and moan'd against the piers.
But o'er the chasm I saw Lord William Howard
By torchlight, and his guard; four guns gaped at me,
Black, silent mouths: had Howard spied me there
And made them speak, as well he might have done,
Their voice had left me none to tell you this.
What shall we do?

BRETT.            On somehow. To go back
Were to lose all.

WYATT.            On over London Bridge
We cannot: stay we cannot; there is ordnance
On the White Tower and on the Devil's Tower,
And pointed full at Southwark; we must round
By Kingston Bridge.

BRETT.              Ten miles about.

WYATT.                               Ev'n so.
But I have notice from our partisans
Within the city that they will stand by us
If Ludgate can be reach'd by dawn to-morrow.

    _Enter one of_ WYATT'S MEN.

MAN. Sir Thomas, I've found this paper; pray
your worship read it; I know not my letters; the old
priests taught me nothing.

WYATT (_reads_). 'Whosoever will apprehend the traitor Thomas Wyatt
shall have a hundred pounds for reward.'

MAN. Is that it? That's a big lot of money.

WYATT. Ay, ay, my friend; not read it? 'tis not written
Half plain enough. Give me a piece of paper!
                                 [_Writes 'THOMAS WYATT' large_.
There, any man can read that.    [_Sticks it in his cap_.

BRETT. But that's foolhardy.

WYATT. No! boldness, which will give my followers boldness.

    _Enter_ MAN _with a prisoner_.

MAN. We found him, your worship, a plundering o' Bishop Winchester's
house; he says he's a poor gentleman.

WYATT. Gentleman! a thief! Go hang him. Shall we make
Those that we come to serve our sharpest foes?

BRETT. Sir Thomas--

WYATT.             Hang him, I say.

BRETT. Wyatt, but now you promised me a boon.

WYATT. Ay, and I warrant this fine fellow's life.

BRETT. Ev'n so; he was my neighbour once in Kent.
He's poor enough, has drunk and gambled out
All that he had, and gentleman he was.
We have been glad together; let him live.

WYATT. He has gambled for his life, and lost, he hangs.
No, no, my word's my word. Take thy poor gentleman!
Gamble thyself at once out of my sight,
Or I will dig thee with my dagger. Away!
Women and children!

    _Enter a Crowd of_ WOMEN _and_ CHILDREN.

FIRST WOMAN. O Sir Thomas, Sir Thomas, pray you go away, Sir Thomas,
or you'll make the White Tower a black 'un for us this blessed day.
He'll be the death on us; and you'll set the Divil's Tower a-spitting,
and he'll smash all our bits o' things worse than Philip o' Spain.

SECOND WOMAN. Don't ye now go to think that we be for Philip o' Spain.

THIRD WOMAN. No, we know that ye be come to kill the Queen, and we'll
pray for you all on our bended knees. But o' God's mercy don't ye kill
the Queen here, Sir Thomas; look ye, here's little Dickon, and little
Robin, and little Jenny--though she's but a side-cousin--and all on
our knees, we pray you to kill the Queen further off, Sir Thomas.

WYATT. My friends, I have not come to kill the Queen
Or here or there: I come to save you all,
And I'll go further off.

CROWD. Thanks, Sir Thomas, we be beholden to you, and we'll pray for
you on our bended knees till our lives' end.

WYATT. Be happy, I am your friend. To Kingston, forward!

                                      [_Exeunt_.



SCENE IV.--ROOM IN THE GATEHOUSE OF WESTMINSTER PALACE.

MARY, ALICE, GARDINER, RENARD, LADIES.


GARDINER. Their cry is, Philip never shall be king.

MARY. Lord Pembroke in command of all our force
Will front their cry and shatter them into dust.

ALICE. Was not Lord Pembroke with Northumberland?
O madam, if this Pembroke should be false?

MARY. No, girl; most brave and loyal, brave and loyal.
His breaking with Northumberland broke Northumberland.
At the park gate he hovers with our guards.
These Kentish ploughmen cannot break the guards.

    _Enter_ MESSENGER.

MESSENGER. Wyatt, your Grace, hath broken thro' the guards
And gone to Ludgate.

GARDINER.            Madam, I much fear
That all is lost; but we can save your Grace.
The river still is free. I do beseech you,
There yet is time, take boat and pass to Windsor.

MARY. I pass to Windsor and I lose my crown.

GARDINER. Pass, then, I pray your Highness, to the Tower.

MARY. I shall but be their prisoner in the Tower.

CRIES _without_. The traitor! treason! Pembroke!

LADIES.                                          Treason! treason!

MARY. Peace.
False to Northumberland, is he false to me?
Bear witness, Renard, that I live and die
The true and faithful bride of Philip--A sound
Of feet and voices thickening hither--blows--
Hark, there is battle at the palace gates,
And I will out upon the gallery.

LADIES. No, no, your Grace; see there the arrows flying.

MARY. I am Harry's daughter, Tudor, and not fear.
                                  [_Goes out on the gallery_.
The guards are all driven in, skulk into corners
Like rabbits to their holes. A gracious guard
Truly; shame on them! they have shut the gates!

    _Enter_ SIR ROBERT SOUTHWELL.

SOUTHWELL. The porter, please your Grace, hath shut the gates
On friend and foe. Your gentlemen-at-arms,
If this be not your Grace's order, cry
To have the gates set wide again, and they
With their good battleaxes will do you right
Against all traitors.

MARY. They are the flower of England; set the gates wide.

                                          [_Exit_ SOUTHWELL.

    _Enter_ COURTENAY.

COURTENAY. All lost, all lost, all yielded! A barge, a barge!
The Queen must to the Tower.

MARY.                        Whence come you, sir?

COURTENAY. From Charing Cross; the rebels broke us there,
And I sped hither with what haste I might
To save my royal cousin.

MARY.                    Where is Pembroke?

COURTENAY. I left him somewhere in the thick of it.

MARY. Left him and fled; and thou that would'st be King,
And hast nor heart nor honour. I myself
Will down into the battle and there bide
The upshot of my quarrel, or die with those
That are no cowards and no Courtenays.

COURTENAY. I do not love your Grace should call me coward.

    _Enter another_ MESSENGER.

MESSENGER. Over, your Grace, all crush'd; the brave Lord William
Thrust him from Ludgate, and the traitor flying
To Temple Bar, there by Sir Maurice Berkeley
Was taken prisoner.

MARY.               To the Tower with _him_!

MESSENGER. 'Tis said he told Sir Maurice there was one
Cognisant of this, and party thereunto,
My Lord of Devon.

MARY.             To the Tower with _him_!

COURTENAY. O la, the Tower, the Tower, always the Tower,
I shall grow into it--I shall be the Tower.

MARY. Your Lordship may not have so long to wait. Remove him!

COURTENAY. La, to whistle out my life,
And carve my coat upon the walls again!
                             [_Exit_ COURTENAY _guarded_.

MESSENGER. Also this Wyatt did confess the Princess
Cognisant thereof, and party thereunto.

MARY. What? whom--whom did you say?

MESSENGER.                          Elizabeth,
Your Royal sister.

MARY.              To the Tower with _her_!
My foes are at my feet and I am Queen.

              [GARDINER _and her_ LADIES _kneel to her_.

GARDINER (_rising_).
There let them lie, your foot-stool! (_Aside_.) Can I strike
Elizabeth?--not now and save the life
Of Devon: if I save him, he and his
Are bound to me--may strike hereafter. (_Aloud_.) Madam,
What Wyatt said, or what they said he said,
Cries of the moment and the street--

MARY. He said it.

GARDINER. Your courts of justice will determine that.

RENARD (_advancing_).
I trust by this your Highness will allow
Some spice of wisdom in my telling you,
When last we talk'd, that Philip would not come
Till Guildford Dudley and the Duke of Suffolk,
And Lady Jane had left us.

MARY.                      They shall die.

RENARD. And your so loving sister?

MARY.                              She shall die.
My foes are at my feet, and Philip King.

                                    [_Exeunt_.




ACT III.



SCENE I.--THE CONDUIT IN GRACECHURCH,

_Painted with the Nine Worthies, among them King Henry VIII. holding a
book, on it inscribed_ 'Verbum Dei'.


    _Enter_ SIR RALPH BAGENHALL _and_ SIR THOMAS STAFFORD.

BAGENHALL. A hundred here and hundreds hang'd in Kent.
The tigress had unsheath'd her nails at last,
And Renard and the Chancellor sharpen'd them.
In every London street a gibbet stood.
They are down to-day. Here by this house was one;
The traitor husband dangled at the door,
And when the traitor wife came out for bread
To still the petty treason therewithin,
Her cap would brush his heels.

STAFFORD.                      It is Sir Ralph,
And muttering to himself as heretofore.
Sir, see you aught up yonder?

BAGENHALL.                    I miss something.
The tree that only bears dead fruit is gone.

STAFFORD. What tree, sir?

BAGENHALL.                Well, the tree in Virgil, sir,
That bears not its own apples.

STAFFORD.                      What! the gallows?

BAGENHALL. Sir, this dead fruit was ripening overmuch,
And had to be removed lest living Spain
Should sicken at dead England.

STAFFORD.                      Not so dead,
But that a shock may rouse her.

BAGENHALL.                      I believe
Sir Thomas Stafford?

STAFFORD.            I am ill disguised.

BAGENHALL. Well, are you not in peril here?

STAFFORD.                                   I think so.
I came to feel the pulse of England, whether
It beats hard at this marriage. Did you see it?

BAGENHALL. Stafford, I am a sad man and a serious.
Far liefer had I in my country hall
Been reading some old book, with mine old hound
Couch'd at my hearth, and mine old flask of wine
Beside me, than have seen it: yet I saw it.

STAFFORD. Good, was it splendid?

BAGENHALL.                       Ay, if Dukes, and Earls,
And Counts, and sixty Spanish cavaliers,
Some six or seven Bishops, diamonds, pearls,
That royal commonplace too, cloth of gold,
Could make it so.

STAFFORD.         And what was Mary's dress?

BAGENHALL. Good faith, I was too sorry for the woman
To mark the dress. She wore red shoes!

STAFFORD.                              Red shoes!

BAGENHALL. Scarlet, as if her feet were wash'd in blood,
As if she had waded in it.

STAFFORD.                  Were your eyes
So bashful that you look'd no higher?

BAGENHALL.                            A diamond,
And Philip's gift, as proof of Philip's love,
Who hath not any for any,--tho' a true one,
Blazed false upon her heart.

STAFFORD.                    But this proud Prince--

BAGENHALL. Nay, he is King, you know, the King of Naples.
The father ceded Naples, that the son
Being a King, might wed a Queen--O he
Flamed in brocade--white satin his trunk-hose,
Inwrought with silver,--on his neck a collar,
Gold, thick with diamonds; hanging down from this
The Golden Fleece--and round his knee, misplaced,
Our English Garter, studded with great emeralds,
Rubies, I know not what. Have you had enough
Of all this gear?

STAFFORD. Ay, since you hate the telling it.
How look'd the Queen?

BAGENHALL.            No fairer for her jewels.
And I could see that as the new-made couple
Came from the Minster, moving side by side
Beneath one canopy, ever and anon
She cast on him a vassal smile of love,
Which Philip with a glance of some distaste,
Or so methought, return'd. I may be wrong, sir.
This marriage will not hold.

STAFFORD.                    I think with you.
The King of France will help to break it.

BAGENHALL.                                France!
We have once had half of France, and hurl'd our battles
Into the heart of Spain; but England now
Is but a ball chuck'd between France and Spain,
His in whose hand she drops; Harry of Bolingbroke
Had holpen Richard's tottering throne to stand,
Could Harry have foreseen that all our nobles
Would perish on the civil slaughter-field,
And leave the people naked to the crown,
And the crown naked to the people; the crown
Female, too! Sir, no woman's regimen
Can save us. We are fallen, and as I think,
Never to rise again.

STAFFORD.            You are too black-blooded.
I'd make a move myself to hinder that:
I know some lusty fellows there in France.

BAGENHALL. You would but make us weaker, Thomas Stafford.
Wyatt was a good soldier, yet he fail'd,
And strengthen'd Philip.

STAFFORD.                Did not his last breath
Clear Courtenay and the Princess from the charge
Of being his co-rebels?

BAGENHALL.              Ay, but then
What such a one as Wyatt says is nothing:
We have no men among us. The new Lords
Are quieted with their sop of Abbeylands,
And ev'n before the Queen's face Gardiner buys them
With Philip's gold. All greed, no faith, no courage!
Why, ev'n the haughty prince, Northumberland,
The leader of our Reformation, knelt
And blubber'd like a lad, and on the scaffold
Recanted, and resold himself to Rome.

STAFFORD. I swear you do your country wrong, Sir Ralph.
I know a set of exiles over there,
Dare-devils, that would eat fire and spit it out
At Philip's beard: they pillage Spain already.
The French King winks at it. An hour will come
When they will sweep her from the seas. No men?
Did not Lord Suffolk die like a true man?
Is not Lord William Howard a true man?
Yea, you yourself, altho' you are black-blooded:
And I, by God, believe myself a man.
Ay, even in the church there is a man--
Cranmer.
Fly would he not, when all men bad him fly.
And what a letter he wrote against the Pope!
There's a brave man, if any.

BAGENHALL.                   Ay; if it hold.

CROWD (_coming on_).
God save their Graces!

STAFFORD.              Bagenhall, I see
The Tudor green and white. (_Trumpets_.) They are coming now.
And here's a crowd as thick as herring-shoals.

BAGENHALL. Be limpets to this pillar, or we are torn
Down the strong wave of brawlers.

CROWD. God save their Graces!

        [_Procession of Trumpeters, Javelin-men, etc.; then
        Spanish and Flemish Nobles intermingled_.

STAFFORD. Worth seeing, Bagenhall! These black dog-Dons
Garb themselves bravely. Who's the long-face there,
Looks very Spain of very Spain?

BAGENHALL.                      The Duke
Of Alva, an iron soldier.

STAFFORD.                 And the Dutchman,
Now laughing at some jest?

BAGENHALL.                 William of Orange,
William the Silent.

STAFFORD.           Why do they call him so?

BAGENHALL. He keeps, they say, some secret that may cost
Philip his life.

STAFFORD.        But then he looks so merry.

BAGENHALL. I cannot tell you why they call him so.

    [_The_ KING _and_ QUEEN _pass, attended by Peers of
    the Realm, Officers of State, etc. Cannon shot off_.

CROWD. Philip and Mary, Philip and Mary!
Long live the King and Queen, Philip and Mary!

STAFFORD. They smile as if content with one another.

BAGENHALL. A smile abroad is oft a scowl at home.

                  [KING _and_ QUEEN _pass on. Procession_.

FIRST CITIZEN. I thought this Philip had been one of those black
devils of Spain, but he hath a yellow beard.

SECOND CITIZEN. Not red like Iscariot's.

FIRST CITIZEN. Like a carrot's, as thou say'st, and English carrot's
better than Spanish licorice; but I thought he was a beast.

THIRD CITIZEN. Certain I had heard that every Spaniard carries a tail
like a devil under his trunk-hose.

TAILOR. Ay, but see what trunk-hoses! Lord! they be fine; I never
stitch'd none such. They make amends for the tails.

FOURTH CITIZEN. Tut! every Spanish priest will tell you that all
English heretics have tails.

FIFTH CITIZEN. Death and the Devil--if he find I have one--

FOURTH CITIZEN. Lo! thou hast call'd them up! here they come--a pale
horse for Death and Gardiner for the Devil.

    _Enter_ GARDINER _(turning back from the procession)_.

GARDINER. Knave, wilt thou wear thy cap before the Queen?

MAN. My Lord, I stand so squeezed among the crowd
I cannot lift my hands unto my head.

GARDINER. Knock off his cap there, some of you about him!
See there be others that can use their hands.
Thou art one of Wyatt's men?

MAN.                         No, my Lord, no.

GARDINER. Thy name, thou knave?

MAN.                            I am nobody, my Lord.

GARDINER (_shouting_).
God's passion! knave, thy name?

MAN.                            I have ears to hear.

GARDINER. Ay, rascal, if I leave thee ears to hear.
Find out his name and bring it me (_to_ ATTENDANT).

ATTENDANT.                        Ay, my Lord.

GARDINER. Knave, thou shalt lose thine ears and find thy tongue,
And shalt be thankful if I leave thee that.
                         [_Coming before the Conduit_.
The conduit painted--the nine worthies--ay!
But then what's here? King Harry with a scroll.
Ha--Verbum Dei--verbum--word of God!
God's passion! do you know the knave that painted it?

ATTENDANT. I do, my Lord.

GARDINER.                 Tell him to paint it out,
And put some fresh device in lieu of it--
A pair of gloves, a pair of gloves, sir; ha?
There is no heresy there.

ATTENDANT.                I will, my Lord;
The man shall paint a pair of gloves. I am sure
(Knowing the man) he wrought it ignorantly,
And not from any malice.

GARDINER.                Word of God
In English! over this the brainless loons
That cannot spell Esaias from St. Paul,
Make themselves drunk and mad, fly out and flare
Into rebellions. I'll have their bibles burnt.
The bible is the priest's. Ay! fellow, what!
Stand staring at me! shout, you gaping rogue!

MAN. I have, my Lord, shouted till I am hoarse.

GARDINER. What hast thou shouted, knave?

MAN.                                     Long live Queen Mary!

GARDINER. Knave, there be two. There be both King and Queen,
Philip and Mary. Shout!

MAN.                    Nay, but, my Lord,
The Queen comes first, Mary and Philip.

GARDINER.                               Shout, then,
Mary and Philip!

MAN.             Mary and Philip!

GARDINER.                         Now,
Thou hast shouted for thy pleasure, shout for mine!
Philip and Mary!

MAN.             Must it be so, my Lord?

GARDINER. Ay, knave.

MAN.                 Philip and Mary!

GARDINER.                             I distrust thee.
Thine is a half voice and a lean assent.
What is thy name?

MAN.              Sanders.

GARDINER.                  What else?

MAN.                                  Zerubbabel.

GARDINER. Where dost thou live?

MAN.                            In Cornhill.

GARDINER.                                    Where, knave, where?

MAN. Sign of the Talbot.

GARDINER.                Come to me to-morrow.--
Rascal!--this land is like a hill of fire,
One crater opens when another shuts.
But so I get the laws against the heretic,
Spite of Lord Paget and Lord William Howard,
And others of our Parliament, revived,
I will show fire on my side--stake and fire--
Sharp work and short. The knaves are easily cow'd.
Follow their Majesties.
                           [_Exit. The crowd following_.

BAGENHALL.              As proud as Becket.

STAFFORD. You would not have him murder'd as Becket was?

BAGENHALL. No--murder fathers murder: but I say
There is no man--there was one woman with us--
It was a sin to love her married, dead
I cannot choose but love her.

STAFFORD.                     Lady Jane?

CROWD (_going off_).
God save their Graces!

STAFFORD.              Did you see her die?

BAGENHALL. No, no; her innocent blood had blinded me.
You call me too black-blooded--true enough
Her dark dead blood is in my heart with mine.
If ever I cry out against the Pope
Her dark dead blood that ever moves with mine
Will stir the living tongue and make the cry.

STAFFORD. Yet doubtless you can tell me how she died?

BAGENHALL. Seventeen--and knew eight languages--in music
Peerless--her needle perfect, and her learning
Beyond the churchmen; yet so meek, so modest,
So wife-like humble to the trivial boy
Mismatch'd with her for policy! I have heard
She would not take a last farewell of him,
She fear'd it might unman him for his end.
She could not be unmann'd--no, nor outwoman'd--
Seventeen--a rose of grace!
Girl never breathed to rival such a rose;
Rose never blew that equall'd such a bud.

STAFFORD.                                 Pray you go on.

BAGENHALL. She came upon the scaffold,
And said she was condemn'd to die for treason;
She had but follow'd the device of those
Her nearest kin: she thought they knew the laws.
But for herself, she knew but little law,
And nothing of the titles to the crown;
She had no desire for that, and wrung her hands,
And trusted God would save her thro' the blood
Of Jesus Christ alone.

STAFFORD.              Pray you go on.

BAGENHALL. Then knelt and said the Misere Mei--
But all in English, mark you; rose again,
And, when the headsman pray'd to be forgiven,
Said, 'You will give me my true crown at last,
But do it quickly;' then all wept but she,
Who changed not colour when she saw the block,
But ask'd him, childlike: 'Will you take it off
Before I lay me down?' 'No, madam,' he said,
Gasping; and when her innocent eyes were bound,
She, with her poor blind hands feeling--'where is it?
Where is it?'--You must fancy that which follow'd,
If you have heart to do it!

CROWD (_in the distance_).
                            God save their Graces!

STAFFORD. Their Graces, our disgraces! God confound them!
Why, she's grown bloodier! when I last was here,
This was against her conscience--would be murder!

BAGENHALL. The 'Thou shall do no murder,' which God's hand
Wrote on her conscience, Mary rubb'd out pale--
She could not make it white--and over that,
Traced in the blackest text of Hell--'Thou shall!'
And sign'd it--Mary!

STAFFORD.            Philip and the Pope
Must have sign'd too. I hear this Legate's coming
To bring us absolution from the Pope.
The Lords and Commons will bow down before him--
You are of the house? what will you do, Sir Ralph?

BAGENHALL. And why should I be bolder than the rest,
Or honester than all?

STAFFORD.             But, sir, if I--
And oversea they say this state of yours
Hath no more mortice than a tower of cards;
And that a puff would do it--then if I
And others made that move I touch'd upon,
Back'd by the power of France, and landing here,
Came with a sudden splendour, shout, and show,
And dazzled men and deafen'd by some bright
Loud venture, and the people so unquiet--
And I the race of murder'd Buckingham--
Not for myself, but for the kingdom--Sir,
I trust that you would fight along with us.

BAGENHALL. No; you would fling your lives into the gulf.

STAFFORD. But if this Philip, as he's like to do,
Left Mary a wife-widow here alone,
Set up a viceroy, sent his myriads hither
To seize upon the forts and fleet, and make us
A Spanish province; would you not fight then?

BAGENHALL. I think I should fight then.

STAFFORD.                               I am sure of it.
Hist! there's the face coming on here of one
Who knows me. I must leave you. Fare you well,
You'll hear of me again.

BAGENHALL.               Upon the scaffold.

                                      [_Exeunt_.



SCENE II.--ROOM IN WHITEHALL PALACE.

MARY. _Enter_ PHILIP _and_ CARDINAL POLE.


POLE. Ave Maria, gratia plena, Benedicta tu in mulieribus.

MARY. Loyal and royal cousin, humblest thanks.
Had you a pleasant voyage up the river?

POLE. We had your royal barge, and that same chair,
Or rather throne of purple, on the deck.
Our silver cross sparkled before the prow,
The ripples twinkled at their diamond-dance,
The boats that follow'd, were as glowing-gay
As regal gardens; and your flocks of swans,
As fair and white as angels; and your shores
Wore in mine eyes the green of Paradise.
My foreign friends, who dream'd us blanketed
In ever-closing fog, were much amazed
To find as fair a sun as might have flash'd
Upon their lake of Garda, fire the Thames;
Our voyage by sea was all but miracle;
And here the river flowing from the sea,
Not toward it (for they thought not of our tides),
Seem'd as a happy miracle to make glide--
In quiet--home your banish'd countryman.

MARY. We heard that you were sick in Flanders, cousin.

POLE. A dizziness.

MARY.              And how came you round again?

POLE. The scarlet thread of Rahab saved her life;
And mine, a little letting of the blood.

MARY. Well? now?

POLE.            Ay, cousin, as the heathen giant
Had but to touch the ground, his force return'd--
Thus, after twenty years of banishment,
Feeling my native land beneath my foot,
I said thereto: 'Ah, native land of mine,
Thou art much beholden to this foot of mine,
That hastes with full commission from the Pope
To absolve thee from thy guilt of heresy.
Thou hast disgraced me and attainted me,
And mark'd me ev'n as Cain, and I return
As Peter, but to bless thee: make me well.'
Methinks the good land heard me, for to-day
My heart beats twenty, when I see you, cousin.
Ah, gentle cousin, since your Herod's death,
How oft hath Peter knock'd at Mary's gate!
And Mary would have risen and let him in,
But, Mary, there were those within the house
Who would not have it.

MARY.                  True, good cousin Pole;
And there were also those without the house
Who would not have it.

POLE.                  I believe so, cousin.
State-policy and church-policy are conjoint,
But Janus-faces looking diverse ways.
I fear the Emperor much misvalued me.
But all is well; 'twas ev'n the will of God,
Who, waiting till the time had ripen'd, now,
Makes me his mouth of holy greeting. 'Hail,
Daughter of God, and saver of the faith.
Sit benedictus fructus ventris tui!'

MARY. Ah, heaven!

POLE.             Unwell, your Grace?

MARY.                                 No, cousin, happy--
Happy to see you; never yet so happy
Since I was crown'd.

POLE.                Sweet cousin, you forget
That long low minster where you gave your hand
To this great Catholic King.

PHILIP.                      Well said, Lord Legate.

MARY. Nay, not well said; I thought of you, my liege,
Ev'n as I spoke.

PHILIP.          Ay, Madam; my Lord Paget
Waits to present our Council to the Legate.
Sit down here, all; Madam, between us you.

POLE. Lo, now you are enclosed with boards of cedar,
Our little sister of the Song of Songs!
You are doubly fenced and shielded sitting here
Between the two most high-set thrones on earth,
The Emperor's highness happily symboll'd by
The King your husband, the Pope's Holiness
By mine own self.

MARY.             True, cousin, I am happy.
When will you that we summon both our houses
To take this absolution from your lips,
And be regather'd to the Papal fold?

POLE. In Britain's calendar the brightest day
Beheld our rough forefathers break their Gods,
And clasp the faith in Christ; but after that
Might not St. Andrew's be her happiest day?

MARY. Then these shall meet upon St. Andrew's day.

    _Enter_ PAGET, _who presents the Council. Dumb show_.

POLE. I am an old man wearied with my journey,
Ev'n with my joy. Permit me to withdraw.
To Lambeth?

PHILIP.     Ay, Lambeth has ousted Cranmer.
It was not meet the heretic swine should live
In Lambeth.

MARY.       There or anywhere, or at all.

PHILIP. We have had it swept and garnish'd after him.

POLE. Not for the seven devils to enter in?

PHILIP. No, for we trust they parted in the swine.

POLE. True, and I am the Angel of the Pope.
Farewell, your Graces.

PHILIP.                Nay, not here--to me;
I will go with you to the waterside.

POLE. Not be my Charon to the counter side?

PHILIP. No, my Lord Legate, the Lord Chancellor goes.

POLE. And unto no dead world; but Lambeth palace,
Henceforth a centre of the living faith.

                        [_Exeunt_ PHILIP, POLE, PAGET, _etc_.

    _Manet_ MARY.

MARY. He hath awaked! he hath awaked!
He stirs within the darkness!
Oh, Philip, husband! now thy love to mine
Will cling more close, and those bleak manners thaw,
That make me shamed and tongue-tied in my love.
The second Prince of Peace--
The great unborn defender of the Faith,
Who will avenge me of mine enemies--
He comes, and my star rises.
The stormy Wyatts and Northumberlands,
The proud ambitions of Elizabeth,
And all her fieriest partisans--are pale
Before my star!
The light of this new learning wanes and dies:
The ghosts of Luther and Zuinglius fade
Into the deathless hell which is their doom
Before my star!
His sceptre shall go forth from Ind to Ind!
His sword shall hew the heretic peoples down!
His faith shall clothe the world that will be his,
Like universal air and sunshine! Open,
Ye everlasting gates! The King is here!--
My star, my son!

    _Enter_ PHILIP, DUKE OF ALVA, _etc_.

                 Oh, Philip, come with me;
Good news have I to tell you, news to make
Both of us happy--ay, the Kingdom too.
Nay come with me--one moment!

PHILIP (_to_ ALVA).           More than that:
There was one here of late--William the Silent
They call him--he is free enough in talk,
But tells me nothing. You will be, we trust,
Sometime the viceroy of those provinces--
He must deserve his surname better.

ALVA.                               Ay, sir;
Inherit the Great Silence.

PHILIP.                    True; the provinces
Are hard to rule and must be hardly ruled;
Most fruitful, yet, indeed, an empty rind,
All hollow'd out with stinging heresies;
And for their heresies, Alva, they will fight;
You must break them or they break you.

ALVA (_proudly_).                      The first.

PHILIP. Good!
Well, Madam, this new happiness of mine?

                                    [_Exeunt_.

    _Enter_ THREE PAGES.

FIRST PAGE. News, mates! a miracle, a miracle! news!
The bells must ring; Te Deums must be sung;
The Queen hath felt the motion of her babe!

SECOND PAGE. Ay; but see here!

FIRST PAGE.                    See what?

SECOND PAGE.                             This paper, Dickon.
I found it fluttering at the palace gates:--
'The Queen of England is delivered of a dead dog!'

THIRD PAGE. These are the things that madden her. Fie upon it!

FIRST PAGE. Ay; but I hear she hath a dropsy, lad,
Or a high-dropsy, as the doctors call it.

THIRD PAGE. Fie on her dropsy, so she have a dropsy!
I know that she was ever sweet to me.

FIRST PAGE. For thou and thine are Roman to the core.

THIRD PAGE. So thou and thine must be. Take heed!

FIRST PAGE.                                       Not I,
And whether this flash of news be false or true,
So the wine run, and there be revelry,
Content am I. Let all the steeples clash,
Till the sun dance, as upon Easter Day.

                                    [_Exeunt_.



SCENE III.--GREAT HALL IN WHITEHALL.

_At the far end a dais. On this three chairs, two under one canopy
for_ MARY _and_ PHILIP, _another on the right of these for_ POLE.
_Under the dais on_ POLE'S _side, ranged along the wall, sit all the
Spiritual Peers, and along the wall opposite, all the Temporal. The
Commons on cross benches in front, a line of approach to the dais
between them. In the foreground_, SIR RALPH BAGENHALL _and other
Members of the Commons_.


FIRST MEMBER. St. Andrew's day; sit close, sit close, we are friends.
Is reconciled the word? the Pope again?
It must be thus; and yet, cocksbody! how strange
That Gardiner, once so one with all of us
Against this foreign marriage, should have yielded
So utterly!--strange! but stranger still that he,
So fierce against the Headship of the Pope,
Should play the second actor in this pageant
That brings him in; such a cameleon he!

SECOND MEMBER. This Gardiner turn'd his coat in Henry's time;
The serpent that hath slough'd will slough again.

THIRD MEMBER. Tut, then we all are serpents.

SECOND MEMBER. Speak for yourself.

THIRD MEMBER. Ay, and for Gardiner! being English citizen,
How should he bear a bridegroom out of Spain?
The Queen would have him! being English churchman
How should he bear the headship of the Pope?
The Queen would have it! Statesmen that are wise
Shape a necessity, as a sculptor clay,
To their own model.

SECOND MEMBER. Statesmen that are wise
Take truth herself for model. What say you?
                          [_To_ SIR RALPH BAGENHALL.

BAGENHALL. We talk and talk.

FIRST MEMBER. Ay, and what use to talk?
Philip's no sudden alien--the Queen's husband,
He's here, and king, or will be--yet cocksbody!
So hated here! I watch'd a hive of late;
My seven-years' friend was with me, my young boy;
Out crept a wasp, with half the swarm behind.
'Philip!' says he. I had to cuff the rogue
For infant treason.

THIRD MEMBER.       But they say that bees,
If any creeping life invade their hive
Too gross to be thrust out, will build him round,
And bind him in from harming of their combs.
And Philip by these articles is bound
From stirring hand or foot to wrong the realm.

SECOND MEMBER. By bonds of beeswax, like your creeping thing;
But your wise bees had stung him first to death.

THIRD MEMBER. Hush, hush!
You wrong the Chancellor: the clauses added
To that same treaty which the emperor sent us
Were mainly Gardiner's: that no foreigner
Hold office in the household, fleet, forts, army;
That if the Queen should die without a child,
The bond between the kingdoms be dissolved;
That Philip should not mix us any way
With his French wars--

SECOND MEMBER. Ay, ay, but what security,
Good sir, for this, if Philip----

THIRD MEMBER. Peace--the Queen, Philip, and Pole.
                                   [_All rise, and stand_.

    _Enter_ MARY, PHILIP, _and_ POLE.

    [GARDINER _conducts them to the three chairs of state_.
    PHILIP _sits on the_ QUEEN'S _left_, POLE _on her right_.

GARDINER. Our short-lived sun, before his winter plunge,
Laughs at the last red leaf, and Andrew's Day.

MARY. Should not this day be held in after years
More solemn than of old?

PHILIP.                  Madam, my wish
Echoes your Majesty's.

POLE.                  It shall be so.

GARDINER. Mine echoes both your Graces'; (_aside_) but the Pope--
Can we not have the Catholic church as well
Without as with the Italian? if we cannot,
Why then the Pope.
                   My lords of the upper house,
And ye, my masters, of the lower house,
Do ye stand fast by that which ye resolved?

VOICES. We do.

GARDINER. And be you all one mind to supplicate
The Legate here for pardon, and acknowledge
The primacy of the Pope?

VOICES.                  We are all one mind.

GARDINER. Then must I play the vassal to this Pole.    [_Aside_.

    [_He draws a paper from under his robes and
    presents it to the_ KING _and_ QUEEN, _who look
    through it and return it to him; then ascends
    a tribune, and reads_.

We, the Lords Spiritual and Temporal,
And Commons here in Parliament assembled,
Presenting the whole body of this realm
Of England, and dominions of the same,
Do make most humble suit unto your Majesties,
In our own name and that of all the state,
That by your gracious means and intercession
Our supplication be exhibited
To the Lord Cardinal Pole, sent here as Legate
From our most Holy Father Julius, Pope,
And from the Apostolic see of Rome;
And do declare our penitence and grief
For our long schism and disobedience,
Either in making laws and ordinances
Against the Holy Father's primacy,
Or else by doing or by speaking aught
Which might impugn or prejudice the same;
By this our supplication promising,
As well for our own selves as all the realm,
That now we be and ever shall be quick,
Under and with your Majesties' authorities,
To do to the utmost all that in us lies
Towards the abrogation and repeal
Of all such laws and ordinances made;
Whereon we humbly pray your Majesties,
As persons undefiled with our offence,
So to set forth this humble suit of ours
That we the rather by your intercession
May from the Apostolic see obtain,
Thro' this most reverend Father, absolution,
And full release from danger of all censures
Of Holy Church that we be fall'n into,
So that we may, as children penitent,
Be once again received into the bosom
And unity of Universal Church;
And that this noble realm thro' after years
May in this unity and obedience
Unto the holy see and reigning Pope
Serve God and both your Majesties.

VOICES. Amen.
                 [_All sit.

    [He again presents the petition to the_ KING _and_
    QUEEN, _who hand it reverentially to_ POLE.

POLE (_sitting_). This is the loveliest day that ever smiled
On England. All her breath should, incenselike,
Rise to the heavens in grateful praise of Him
Who now recalls her to His ancient fold.
Lo! once again God to this realm hath given
A token of His more especial Grace;
For as this people were the first of all
The islands call'd into the dawning church
Out of the dead, deep night of heathendom,
So now are these the first whom God hath given
Grace to repent and sorrow for their schism;
And if your penitence be not mockery,
Oh how the blessed angels who rejoice
Over one saved do triumph at this hour
In the reborn salvation of a land
So noble.    [_A pause_.
          For ourselves we do protest
That our commission is to heal, not harm;
We come not to condemn, but reconcile;
We come not to compel, but call again;
We come not to destroy, but edify;
Nor yet to question things already done;
These are forgiven--matters of the past--
And range with jetsam and with offal thrown
Into the blind sea of forgetfulness.    [_A pause_.
Ye have reversed the attainder laid on us
By him who sack'd the house of God; and we,
Amplier than any field on our poor earth
Can render thanks in fruit for being sown,
Do here and now repay you sixty-fold,
A hundred, yea, a thousand thousand-fold,
With heaven for earth.

    [_Rising and stretching forth his hands. All kneel but_
    SIR RALPH BAGENHALL, _who rises and remains standing_.

                       The Lord who hath redeem'd us
With His own blood, and wash'd us from our sins,
To purchase for Himself a stainless bride;
He, whom the Father hath appointed Head
Of all his church, He by His mercy absolve you!    [_A pause_.
And we by that authority Apostolic,
Given unto us, his Legate, by the Pope,
Our Lord and Holy Father, Julius,
God's Vicar and Vicegerent upon earth,
Do here absolve you and deliver you
And every one of you, and all the realm
And its dominions from all heresy,
All schism, and from all and every censure,
Judgment, and pain accruing thereupon;
And also we restore you to the bosom
And unity of Universal Church.
                         [_Turning to_ GARDINER.
Our letters of commission will declare this plainlier.

    [QUEEN _heard sobbing. Cries of_ Amen! Amen! _Some of the
    Members embrace one another. All but_ SIR RALPH BAGENHALL
    _pass out into the neighboring chapel, whence is heard
    the Te Deum_.

BAGENHALL. We strove against the papacy from the first,
In William's time, in our first Edward's time,
And in my master Henry's time; but now,
The unity of Universal Church,
Mary would have it; and this Gardiner follows;
The unity of Universal Hell,
Philip would have it; and this Gardiner follows!
A Parliament of imitative apes!
Sheep at the gap which Gardiner takes, who not
Believes the Pope, nor any of them believe--
These spaniel-Spaniard English of the time,
Who rub their fawning noses in the dust,
For that is Philip's gold-dust, and adore
This Vicar of their Vicar. Would I had been
Born Spaniard! I had held my head up then.
I am ashamed that I am Bagenhall,
English.

    _Enter_ OFFICER.

OFFICER. Sir Ralph Bagenhall!

BAGENHALL.                    What of that?

OFFICER. You were the one sole man in either house
Who stood upright when both the houses fell.

BAGENHALL. The houses fell!

OFFICER.                    I mean the houses knelt
Before the Legate.

BAGENHALL.         Do not scrimp your phrase,
But stretch it wider; say when England fell.

OFFICER. I say you were the one sole man who stood.

BAGENHALL. I am the one sole man in either house,
Perchance in England, loves her like a son.

OFFICER. Well, you one man, because you stood upright,
Her Grace the Queen commands you to the Tower.

BAGENHALL. As traitor, or as heretic, or for what?

OFFICER. If any man in any way would be
The one man, he shall be so to his cost.

BAGENHALL. What! will she have my head?

OFFICER.                                A round fine likelier.
Your pardon.    [_Calling to_ ATTENDANT.
             By the river to the Tower.

                                    [_Exeunt_.



SCENE IV.--WHITEHALL. A ROOM IN THE PALACE.
MARY, GARDINER, POLE, PAGET, BONNER, _etc_.


MARY. The King and I, my Lords, now that all traitors
Against our royal state have lost the heads
Wherewith they plotted in their treasonous malice,
Have talk'd together, and are well agreed
That those old statutes touching Lollardism
To bring the heretic to the stake, should be
No longer a dead letter, but requicken'd.

ONE OF THE COUNCIL. Why, what hath fluster'd Gardiner? how he rubs
His forelock!

PAGET.        I have changed a word with him
In coming, and may change a word again.

GARDINER. Madam, your Highness is our sun, the King
And you together our two suns in one;
And so the beams of both may shine upon us,
The faith that seem'd to droop will feel your light,
Lift head, and flourish; yet not light alone,
There must be heat--there must be heat enough
To scorch and wither heresy to the root.
For what saith Christ? 'Compel them to come in.'
And what saith Paul? 'I would they were cut off
That trouble you.' Let the dead letter live!
Trace it in fire, that all the louts to whom
Their A B C is darkness, clowns and grooms
May read it! so you quash rebellion too,
For heretic and traitor are all one:
Two vipers of one breed--an amphisbaena,
Each end a sting: Let the dead letter burn!

PAGET. Yet there be some disloyal Catholics,
And many heretics loyal; heretic throats
Cried no God-bless-her to the Lady Jane,
But shouted in Queen Mary. So there be
Some traitor-heretic, there is axe and cord.
To take the lives of others that are loyal,
And by the churchman's pitiless doom of fire,
Were but a thankless policy in the crown,
Ay, and against itself; for there are many.

MARY. If we could burn out heresy, my Lord Paget,
We reck not tho' we lost this crown of England--
Ay! tho' it were ten Englands!

GARDINER.                      Right, your Grace.
Paget, you are all for this poor life of ours,
And care but little for the life to be.

PAGET. I have some time, for curiousness, my Lord
Watch'd children playing at _their_ life to be,
And cruel at it, killing helpless flies;
Such is our time--all times for aught I know.

GARDINER. We kill the heretics that sting the soul--
They, with right reason, flies that prick the flesh.

PAGET. They had not reach'd right reason; little children!
They kill'd but for their pleasure and the power
They felt in killing.

GARDINER.            A spice of Satan, ha!
Why, good! what then? granted!--we are fallen creatures;
Look to your Bible, Paget! we are fallen.

PAGET. I am but of the laity, my Lord Bishop,
And may not read your Bible, yet I found
One day, a wholesome scripture, 'Little children,
Love one another.'

GARDINER.          Did you find a scripture,
'I come not to bring peace but a sword'? The sword
Is in her Grace's hand to smite with. Paget,
You stand up here to fight for heresy,
You are more than guess'd at as a heretic,
And on the steep-up track of the true faith
Your lapses are far seen.

PAGET.                    The faultless Gardiner!

MARY. You brawl beyond the question; speak, Lord Legate!

POLE. Indeed, I cannot follow with your Grace:
Rather would say--the shepherd doth not kill
The sheep that wander from his flock, but sends
His careful dog to bring them to the fold.
Look to the Netherlands, wherein have been
Such holocausts of heresy! to what end?
For yet the faith is not established there.

GARDINER. The end's not come.

POLE. No--nor this way will come,
Seeing there lie two ways to every end,
A better and a worse--the worse is here
To persecute, because to persecute
Makes a faith hated, and is furthermore
No perfect witness of a perfect faith
In him who persecutes: when men are tost
On tides of strange opinion, and not sure
Of their own selves, they are wroth with their own selves,
And thence with others; then, who lights the faggot?
Not the full faith, no, but the lurking doubt.
Old Rome, that first made martyrs in the Church,
Trembled for her own gods, for these were trembling--
But when did our Rome tremble?

PAGET.                         Did she not
In Henry's time and Edward's?

POLE.                         What, my Lord!
The Church on Peter's rock? never! I have seen
A pine in Italy that cast its shadow
Athwart a cataract; firm stood the pine--
The cataract shook the shadow. To my mind,
The cataract typed the headlong plunge and fall
Of heresy to the pit: the pine was Rome.
You see, my Lords,
It was the shadow of the Church that trembled;
Your church was but the shadow of a church,
Wanting the Papal mitre.

GARDINER (_muttering_).  Here be tropes.

POLE. And tropes are good to clothe a naked truth,
And make it look more seemly.

GARDINER.                     Tropes again!

POLE. You are hard to please. Then without tropes, my Lord,
An overmuch severeness, I repeat,
When faith is wavering makes the waverer pass
Into more settled hatred of the doctrines
Of those who rule, which hatred by and by
Involves the ruler (thus there springs to light
That Centaur of a monstrous Commonweal,
The traitor-heretic) then tho' some may quail,
Yet others are that dare the stake and fire,
And their strong torment bravely borne, begets
An admiration and an indignation,
And hot desire to imitate; so the plague
Of schism spreads; were there but three or four
Of these misleaders, yet I would not say
Burn! and we cannot burn whole towns; they are many,
As my Lord Paget says.

GARDINER.              Yet my Lord Cardinal--

POLE. I am your Legate; please you let me finish.
Methinks that under our Queen's regimen
We might go softlier than with crimson rowel
And streaming lash. When Herod-Henry first
Began to batter at your English Church,
This was the cause, and hence the judgment on her.
She seethed with such adulteries, and the lives
Of many among your churchmen were so foul
That heaven wept and earth blush'd. I would advise
That we should thoroughly cleanse the Church within
Before these bitter statutes be requicken'd.
So after that when she once more is seen
White as the light, the spotless bride of Christ,
Like Christ himself on Tabor, possibly
The Lutheran may be won to her again;
Till when, my Lords, I counsel tolerance.

GARDINER. What, if a mad dog bit your hand, my Lord,
Would you not chop the bitten finger off,
Lest your whole body should madden with the poison?
I would not, were I Queen, tolerate the heretic,
No, not an hour. The ruler of a land
Is bounden by his power and place to see
His people be not poison'd. Tolerate them!
Why? do they tolerate you? Nay, many of them
Would burn--have burnt each other; call they not
The one true faith, a loathsome idol-worship?
Beware, Lord Legate, of a heavier crime
Than heresy is itself; beware, I say,
Lest men accuse you of indifference
To all faiths, all religion; for you know
Right well that you yourself have been supposed
Tainted with Lutheranism in Italy.

POLE (_angered_). But you, my Lord, beyond all supposition,
In clear and open day were congruent
With that vile Cranmer in the accursed lie
Of good Queen Catherine's divorce--the spring
Of all those evils that have flow'd upon us;
For you yourself have truckled to the tyrant,
And done your best to bastardise our Queen,
For which God's righteous judgment fell upon you
In your five years of imprisonment, my Lord,
Under young Edward. Who so bolster'd up
The gross King's headship of the Church, or more
Denied the Holy Father!

GARDINER.               Ha! what! eh?
But you, my Lord, a polish'd gentleman,
A bookman, flying from the heat and tussle,
You lived among your vines and oranges,
In your soft Italy yonder! You were sent for.
You were appeal'd to, but you still preferr'd
Your learned leisure. As for what I did
I suffer'd and repented. You, Lord Legate
And Cardinal-Deacon, have not now to learn
That ev'n St. Peter in his time of fear
Denied his Master, ay, and thrice, my Lord.

POLE. But not for five-and-twenty years, my Lord.

GARDINER. Ha! good! it seems then I was summon'd hither
But to be mock'd and baited. Speak, friend Bonner,
And tell this learned Legate he lacks zeal.
The Church's evil is not as the King's,
Cannot be heal'd by stroking. The mad bite
Must have the cautery--tell him--and at once.
What would'st thou do hadst thou his power, thou
That layest so long in heretic bonds with me;
Would'st thou not burn and blast them root and branch?

BONNER. Ay, after you, my Lord.

GARDINER.                       Nay, God's passion, before me! speak'

BONNER. I am on fire until I see them flame.

GARDINER. Ay, the psalm-singing weavers, cobblers, scum--
But this most noble prince Plantagenet,
Our good Queen's cousin--dallying over seas
Even when his brother's, nay, his noble mother's,
Head fell--

POLE.      Peace, madman!
Thou stirrest up a grief thou canst not fathom.
Thou Christian Bishop, thou Lord Chancellor
Of England! no more rein upon thine anger
Than any child! Thou mak'st me much ashamed
That I was for a moment wroth at thee.

MARY. I come for counsel and ye give me feuds,
Like dogs that set to watch their master's gate,
Fall, when the thief is ev'n within the walls,
To worrying one another. My Lord Chancellor,
You have an old trick of offending us;
And but that you are art and part with us
In purging heresy, well we might, for this
Your violence and much roughness to the Legate,
Have shut you from our counsels. Cousin Pole,
You are fresh from brighter lands. Retire with me.
His Highness and myself (so you allow us)
Will let you learn in peace and privacy
What power this cooler sun of England hath
In breeding godless vermin. And pray Heaven
That you may see according to our sight.
Come, cousin.
                 [_Exeunt_ QUEEN _and_ POLE, _etc_.

GARDINER. Pole has the Plantagenet face,
But not the force made them our mightiest kings.
Fine eyes--but melancholy, irresolute--
A fine beard, Bonner, a very full fine beard.
But a weak mouth, an indeterminate--ha?

BONNER. Well, a weak mouth, perchance.

GARDINER.                              And not like thine
To gorge a heretic whole, roasted or raw.

BONNER. I'd do my best, my Lord; but yet the Legate
Is here as Pope and Master of the Church,
And if he go not with you--

GARDINER.                  Tut, Master Bishop,
Our bashful Legate, saw'st not how he flush'd?
Touch him upon his old heretical talk,
He'll burn a diocese to prove his orthodoxy.
And let him call me truckler. In those times,
Thou knowest we had to dodge, or duck, or die;
I kept my head for use of Holy Church;
And see you, we shall have to dodge again,
And let the Pope trample our rights, and plunge
His foreign fist into our island Church
To plump the leaner pouch of Italy.
For a time, for a time.
Why? that these statutes may be put in force,
And that his fan may thoroughly purge his floor.

BONNER. So then you hold the Pope--

GARDINER.                          I hold the Pope!
What do I hold him? what do I hold the Pope?
Come, come, the morsel stuck--this Cardinal's fault--
I have gulpt it down. I am wholly for the Pope,
Utterly and altogether for the Pope,
The Eternal Peter of the changeless chair,
Crown'd slave of slaves, and mitred king of kings,
God upon earth! what more? what would you have?
Hence, let's be gone.

    _Enter_ USHER.

USHER.                Well that you be not gone,
My Lord. The Queen, most wroth at first with you,
Is now content to grant you full forgiveness,
So that you crave full pardon of the Legate.
I am sent to fetch you.

GARDINER.               Doth Pole yield, sir, ha!
Did you hear 'em? were you by?

USHER.                         I cannot tell you,
His bearing is so courtly-delicate;
And yet methinks he falters: their two Graces
Do so dear-cousin and royal-cousin him,
So press on him the duty which as Legate
He owes himself, and with such royal smiles--

GARDINER. Smiles that burn men. Bonner, it will be carried.
He falters, ha? 'fore God, we change and change;
Men now are bow'd and old, the doctors tell you,
At three-score years; then if we change at all
We needs must do it quickly; it is an age
Of brief life, and brief purpose, and brief patience,
As I have shown to-day. I am sorry for it
If Pole be like to turn. Our old friend Cranmer,
Your more especial love, hath turn'd so often,
He knows not where he stands, which, if this pass,
We two shall have to teach him; let 'em look to it,
Cranmer and Hooper, Ridley and Latimer,
Rogers and Ferrar, for their time is come,
Their hour is hard at hand, their 'dies Irae'
Their 'dies Illa,' which will test their sect.
I feel it but a duty--you will find in it
Pleasure as well as duty, worthy Bonner,--
To test their sect. Sir, I attend the Queen
To crave most humble pardon--of her most
Royal, Infallible, Papal Legate-cousin.

                                  [_Exeunt_.



SCENE V.--WOODSTOCK.

ELIZABETH, LADY IN WAITING.


ELIZABETH. So they have sent poor Courtenay over sea.

LADY. And banish'd us to Woodstock, and the fields.
The colours of our Queen are green and white,
These fields are only green, they make me gape.

ELIZABETH. There's whitethorn, girl.

  LADY. Ay, for an hour in May.
But court is always May, buds out in masques,
Breaks into feather'd merriments, and flowers
In silken pageants. Why do they keep us here?
Why still suspect your Grace?

ELIZABETH.                    Hard upon both.
    [_Writes on the window with a diamond_.

    Much suspected, of me
    Nothing proven can be.
          Quoth Elizabeth, prisoner.

LADY. What hath your Highness written?

ELIZABETH.                             A true rhyme.

LADY. Cut with a diamond; so to last like truth.

ELIZABETH. Ay, if truth last.

LADY.                         But truth, they say, will out,
So it must last. It is not like a word,
That comes and goes in uttering.

ELIZABETH.                       Truth, a word!
The very Truth and very Word are one.
But truth of story, which I glanced at, girl,
Is like a word that comes from olden days,
And passes thro' the peoples: every tongue
Alters it passing, till it spells and speaks
Quite other than at first.

LADY.                      I do not follow.

ELIZABETH. How many names in the long sweep of time
That so foreshortens greatness, may but hang
On the chance mention of some fool that once
Brake bread with us, perhaps: and my poor chronicle
Is but of glass. Sir Henry Bedingfield
May split it for a spite.

LADY.                     God grant it last,
And witness to your Grace's innocence,
Till doomsday melt it.

ELIZABETH.             Or a second fire,
Like that which lately crackled underfoot
And in this very chamber, fuse the glass,
And char us back again into the dust
We spring from. Never peacock against rain
Scream'd as you did for water.

LADY.                          And I got it.
I woke Sir Henry--and he's true to you
I read his honest horror in his eyes.

ELIZABETH. Or true to you?

LADY.                      Sir Henry Bedingfield!
I will have no man true to me, your Grace,
But one that pares his nails; to me? the clown!

ELIZABETH. Out, girl! you wrong a noble gentleman.

LADY. For, like his cloak, his manners want the nap
And gloss of court; but of this fire he says.
Nay swears, it was no wicked wilfulness,
Only a natural chance.

ELIZABETH.             A chance--perchance
One of those wicked wilfuls that men make,
Nor shame to call it nature. Nay, I know
They hunt my blood. Save for my daily range
Among the pleasant fields of Holy Writ
I might despair. But there hath some one come;
The house is all in movement. Hence, and see.

                                     [_Exit_ LADY.

MILKMAID (_singing without_).

    Shame upon you, Robin,
        Shame upon you now!
    Kiss me would you? with my hands
        Milking the cow?
        Daisies grow again,
        Kingcups blow again,
    And you came and kiss'd me milking the cow.

    Robin came behind me,
        Kiss'd me well I vow;
    Cuff him could I? with my hands
        Milking the cow?
        Swallows fly again,
        Cuckoos cry again,
    And you came and kiss'd me milking the cow.

    Come, Robin, Robin,
        Come and kiss me now;
    Help it can I? with my hands
        Milking the cow?
        Ringdoves coo again,
        All things woo again.
    Come behind and kiss me milking the cow!

ELIZABETH. Right honest and red-cheek'd; Robin was violent,
And she was crafty--a sweet violence,
And a sweet craft. I would I were a milkmaid,
To sing, love, marry, churn, brew, bake, and die,
Then have my simple headstone by the church,
And all things lived and ended honestly.
I could not if I would. I am Harry's daughter:
Gardiner would have my head. They are not sweet,
The violence and the craft that do divide
The world of nature; what is weak must lie;
The lion needs but roar to guard his young;
The lapwing lies, says 'here' when they are there.
Threaten the child; 'I'll scourge you if you did it:'
What weapon hath the child, save his soft tongue,
To say 'I did not?' and my rod's the block.
I never lay my head upon the pillow
But that I think, 'Wilt thou lie there to-morrow?'
How oft the falling axe, that never fell,
Hath shock'd me back into the daylight truth
That it may fall to-day! Those damp, black, dead
Nights in the Tower; dead--with the fear of death
Too dead ev'n for a death-watch! Toll of a bell,
Stroke of a clock, the scurrying of a rat
Affrighted me, and then delighted me,
For there was life--And there was life in death--
The little murder'd princes, in a pale light,
Rose hand in hand, and whisper'd, 'come away!
The civil wars are gone for evermore:
Thou last of all the Tudors, come away!
With us is peace!' The last? It was a dream;
I must not dream, not wink, but watch. She has gone,
Maid Marian to her Robin--by and by
Both happy! a fox may filch a hen by night,
And make a morning outcry in the yard;
But there's no Renard here to 'catch her tripping.'
Catch me who can; yet, sometime I have wish'd
That I were caught, and kill'd away at once
Out of the flutter. The gray rogue, Gardiner,
Went on his knees, and pray'd me to confess
In Wyatt's business, and to cast myself
Upon the good Queen's mercy; ay, when, my Lord?
God save the Queen! My jailor--

    _Enter_ SIR HENRY BEDINGFIELD.

BEDINGFIELD. One, whose bolts,
That jail you from free life, bar you from death.
There haunt some Papist ruffians hereabout
Would murder you.

ELIZABETH.        I thank you heartily, sir,
But I am royal, tho' your prisoner,
And God hath blest or cursed me with a nose--
Your boots are from the horses.

BEDINGFIELD.                    Ay, my Lady.
When next there comes a missive from the Queen
It shall be all my study for one hour
To rose and lavender my horsiness,
Before I dare to glance upon your Grace.

ELIZABETH. A missive from the Queen: last time she wrote,
I had like to have lost my life: it takes my breath:
O God, sir, do you look upon your boots,
Are you so small a man? Help me: what think you,
Is it life or death.

BEDINGFIELD.         I thought not on my boots;
The devil take all boots were ever made
Since man went barefoot. See, I lay it here,
For I will come no nearer to your Grace;

    [_Laying down the letter_.

And, whether it bring you bitter news or sweet,
And God hath given your Grace a nose, or not,
I'll help you, if I may.

ELIZABETH.               Your pardon, then;
It is the heat and narrowness of the cage
That makes the captive testy; with free wing
The world were all one Araby. Leave me now,
Will you, companion to myself, sir?

BEDINGFIELD.                        Will I?
With most exceeding willingness, I will;
You know I never come till I be call'd.
                                    [_Exit_.

ELIZABETH. It lies there folded: is there venom in it?
A snake--and if I touch it, it may sting.
Come, come, the worst!
Best wisdom is to know the worst at once.    [_Reads:_

'It is the King's wish, that you should wed Prince Philibert of Savoy.
You are to come to Court on the instant; and think of this in your
coming.    'MARY THE QUEEN.'

Think I have many thoughts;
I think there may be birdlime here for me;
I think they fain would have me from the realm;
I think the Queen may never bear a child;
I think that I may be some time the Queen,
Then, Queen indeed: no foreign prince or priest
Should fill my throne, myself upon the steps.
I think I will not marry anyone,
Specially not this landless Philibert
Of Savoy; but, if Philip menace me,
I think that I will play with Philibert,
As once the Holy Father did with mine,
Before my father married my good mother,--
For fear of Spain.

    _Enter_ LADY.

LADY.             O Lord! your Grace, your Grace,
I feel so happy: it seems that we shall fly
These bald, blank fields, and dance into the sun
That shines on princes.

ELIZABETH.              Yet, a moment since,
I wish'd myself the milkmaid singing here,
To kiss and cuff among the birds and flowers--
A right rough life and healthful.

LADY.                             But the wench
Hath her own troubles; she is weeping now;
For the wrong Robin took her at her word.
Then the cow kick'd, and all her milk was spilt.
Your Highness such a milkmaid?

ELIZABETH.                     I had kept
My Robins and my cows in sweeter order
Had I been such.

LADY (_slyly_).  And had your Grace a Robin?

ELIZABETH. Come, come, you are chill here; you want the sun
That shines at court; make ready for the journey.
Pray God, we 'scape the sunstroke. Ready at once.

                                          [_Exeunt_.



SCENE VI.--LONDON. A ROOM IN THE PALACE.

LORD PETRE _and_ LORD WILLIAM HOWARD.


PETRE. You cannot see the Queen. Renard denied her,
Ev'n now to me.

HOWARD.         Their Flemish go-between
And all-in-all. I came to thank her Majesty
For freeing my friend Bagenhall from the Tower;
A grace to me! Mercy, that herb-of-grace,
Flowers now but seldom.

PETRE.                  Only now perhaps.
Because the Queen hath been three days in tears
For Philip's going--like the wild hedge-rose
Of a soft winter, possible, not probable,
However you have prov'n it.

HOWARD.                     I must see her.

    _Enter_ RENARD.

RENARD. My Lords, you cannot see her Majesty.

HOWARD. Why then the King! for I would have him bring it
Home to the leisure wisdom of his Queen,
Before he go, that since these statutes past,
Gardiner out-Gardiners Gardiner in his heat,
Bonner cannot out-Bonner his own self--
Beast!--but they play with fire as children do,
And burn the house. I know that these are breeding
A fierce resolve and fixt heart-hate in men
Against the King, the Queen, the Holy Father,
The faith itself. Can I not see him?

RENARD.                              Not now.
And in all this, my Lord, her Majesty
Is flint of flint, you may strike fire from her,
Not hope to melt her. I will give your message.

                          [_Exeunt_ PETRE _and_ HOWARD.

    _Enter_ PHILIP _(musing)_

PHILIP. She will not have Prince Philibert of Savoy,
I talk'd with her in vain--says she will live
And die true maid--a goodly creature too.
Would _she_ had been the Queen! yet she must have him;
She troubles England: that she breathes in England
Is life and lungs to every rebel birth
That passes out of embryo.
                           Simon Renard!
This Howard, whom they fear, what was he saying?

RENARD. What your imperial father said, my liege,
To deal with heresy gentlier. Gardiner burns,
And Bonner burns; and it would seem this people
Care more for our brief life in their wet land,
Than yours in happier Spain. I told my Lord
He should not vex her Highness; she would say
These are the means God works with, that His church
May flourish.

PHILIP.       Ay, sir, but in statesmanship
To strike too soon is oft to miss the blow.
Thou knowest I bad my chaplain, Castro, preach
Against these burnings.

RENARD.                 And the Emperor
Approved you, and when last he wrote, declared
His comfort in your Grace that you were bland
And affable to men of all estates,
In hope to charm them from their hate of Spain.

PHILIP. In hope to crush all heresy under Spain.
But, Renard, I am sicker staying here
Than any sea could make me passing hence,
Tho' I be ever deadly sick at sea.
So sick am I with biding for this child.
Is it the fashion in this clime for women
To go twelve months in bearing of a child?
The nurses yawn'd, the cradle gaped, they led
Processions, chanted litanies, clash'd their bells,
Shot off their lying cannon, and her priests
Have preach'd, the fools, of this fair prince to come;
Till, by St. James, I find myself the fool.
Why do you lift your eyebrow at me thus?

RENARD. I never saw your Highness moved till now.

PHILIP. So weary am I of this wet land of theirs,
And every soul of man that breathes therein.

RENARD. My liege, we must not drop the mask before
The masquerade is over--

PHILIP.                 --Have I dropt it?
I have but shown a loathing face to you,
Who knew it from the first.

    _Enter_ MARY.

MARY (_aside_).             With Renard. Still
Parleying with Renard, all the day with Renard,
And scarce a greeting all the day for me--
And goes to-morrow.
                       [_Exit_ MARY.

PHILIP (_to_ RENARD, _who advances to him_).
                    Well, sir, is there more?

RENARD (_who has perceived the QUEEN_).
May Simon Renard speak a single word?

PHILIP. Ay.

RENARD.     And be forgiven for it?

PHILIP.                             Simon Renard
Knows me too well to speak a single word
That could not be forgiven.

RENARD.                     Well, my liege,
Your Grace hath a most chaste and loving wife.

PHILIP. Why not? The Queen of Philip should be chaste.

RENARD. Ay, but, my Lord, you know what Virgil sings,
Woman is various and most mutable.

PHILIP. She play the harlot! never.

RENARD.                             No, sire, no,
Not dream'd of by the rabidest gospeller.
There was a paper thrown into the palace,
'The King hath wearied of his barren bride.'
She came upon it, read it, and then rent it,
With all the rage of one who hates a truth
He cannot but allow. Sire, I would have you--
What should I say, I cannot pick my words--
Be somewhat less--majestic to your Queen.

PHILIP. Am I to change my manners, Simon Renard,
Because these islanders are brutal beasts?
Or would you have me turn a sonneteer,
And warble those brief-sighted eyes of hers?

RENARD. Brief-sighted tho' they be, I have seen them, sire,
When you perchance were trifling royally
With some fair dame of court, suddenly fill
With such fierce fire--had it been fire indeed
It would have burnt both speakers.

PHILIP.                            Ay, and then?

RENARD. Sire, might it not be policy in some matter
Of small importance now and then to cede
A point to her demand?

PHILIP.                Well, I am going.

RENARD. For should her love when you are gone, my liege,
Witness these papers, there will not be wanting
Those that will urge her injury--should her love--
And I have known such women more than one--
Veer to the counterpoint, and jealousy
Hath in it an alchemic force to fuse
Almost into one metal love and hate,--
And she impress her wrongs upon her Council,
And these again upon her Parliament--
We are not loved here, and would be then perhaps
Not so well holpen in our wars with France,
As else we might be--here she comes.

    _Enter_ MARY.

MARY.                                O Philip!
Nay, must you go indeed?

PHILIP.                  Madam, I must.

MARY. The parting of a husband and a wife
Is like the cleaving of a heart; one half
Will flutter here, one there.

PHILIP.                       You say true, Madam.

MARY. The Holy Virgin will not have me yet
Lose the sweet hope that I may bear a prince.
If such a prince were born and you not here!

PHILIP. I should be here if such a prince were born.

MARY. But must you go?

PHILIP.                Madam, you know my father,
Retiring into cloistral solitude
To yield the remnant of his years to heaven,
Will shift the yoke and weight of all the world
From off his neck to mine. We meet at Brussels.
But since mine absence will not be for long,
Your Majesty shall go to Dover with me,
And wait my coming back.

MARY.                    To Dover? no,
I am too feeble. I will go to Greenwich,
So you will have me with you; and there watch
All that is gracious in the breath of heaven
Draw with your sails from our poor land, and pass
And leave me, Philip, with my prayers for you.

PHILIP. And doubtless I shall profit by your prayers.

MARY. Methinks that would you tarry one day more
(The news was sudden) I could mould myself
To bear your going better; will you do it?

PHILIP. Madam, a day may sink or save a realm.

MARY. A day may save a heart from breaking too.

PHILIP. Well, Simon Renard, shall we stop a day?

RENARD. Your Grace's business will not suffer, sire,
For one day more, so far as I can tell.

PHILIP. Then one day more to please her Majesty.

MARY. The sunshine sweeps across my life again.
O if I knew you felt this parting, Philip,
As I do!

PHILIP.  By St. James I do protest,
Upon the faith and honour of a Spaniard,
I am vastly grieved to leave your Majesty.
Simon, is supper ready?

RENARD.                 Ay, my liege,
I saw the covers laying.

PHILIP.                  Let us have it.

                                   [_Exeunt_.




ACT IV.


SCENE I.--A ROOM IN THE PALACE.

MARY, CARDINAL POLE.


MARY. What have you there?

POLE.                      So please your Majesty,
A long petition from the foreign exiles
To spare the life of Cranmer. Bishop Thirlby,
And my Lord Paget and Lord William Howard,
Crave, in the same cause, hearing of your Grace.
Hath he not written himself--infatuated--
To sue you for his life?

MARY.                    His life? Oh, no;
Not sued for that--he knows it were in vain.
But so much of the anti-papal leaven
Works in him yet, he hath pray'd me not to sully
Mine own prerogative, and degrade the realm
By seeking justice at a stranger's hand
Against my natural subject. King and Queen,
To whom he owes his loyalty after God,
Shall these accuse him to a foreign prince?
Death would not grieve him more. I cannot be
True to this realm of England and the Pope
Together, says the heretic.

POLE.                       And there errs;
As he hath ever err'd thro' vanity.
A secular kingdom is but as the body
Lacking a soul; and in itself a beast.
The Holy Father in a secular kingdom
Is as the soul descending out of heaven
Into a body generate.

MARY.                 Write to him, then.

POLE. I will.

MARY.         And sharply, Pole.

POLE.                            Here come the Cranmerites!

    _Enter_ THIRLBY, LORD PAGET, LORD WILLIAM HOWARD.

HOWARD. Health to your Grace! Good morrow, my Lord Cardinal;
We make our humble prayer unto your Grace
That Cranmer may withdraw to foreign parts,
Or into private life within the realm.
In several bills and declarations, Madam,
He hath recanted all his heresies.

PAGET. Ay, ay; if Bonner have not forged the bills.    [_Aside_.

MARY. Did not More die, and Fisher? he must burn.

HOWARD. He hath recanted, Madam.

MARY.                            The better for him.
He burns in Purgatory, not in Hell.

HOWARD. Ay, ay, your Grace; but it was never seen
That any one recanting thus at full,
As Cranmer hath, came to the fire on earth.

MARY. It will be seen now, then.

THIRLBY.                         O Madam, Madam!
I thus implore you, low upon my knees,
To reach the hand of mercy to my friend.
I have err'd with him; with him I have recanted.
What human reason is there why my friend
Should meet with lesser mercy than myself?

MARY. My Lord of Ely, this. After a riot
We hang the leaders, let their following go.
Cranmer is head and father of these heresies,
New learning as they call it; yea, may God
Forget me at most need when I forget
Her foul divorce--my sainted mother--No!--

HOWARD. Ay, ay, but mighty doctors doubted there.
The Pope himself waver'd; and more than one
Row'd in that galley--Gardiner to wit,
Whom truly I deny not to have been
Your faithful friend and trusty councillor.
Hath not your Highness ever read his book.
His tractate upon True Obedience,
Writ by himself and Bonner?

MARY.                       I will take
Such order with all bad, heretical books
That none shall hold them in his house and live,
Henceforward. No, my Lord.

HOWARD.                    Then never read it.
The truth is here. Your father was a man
Of such colossal kinghood, yet so courteous,
Except when wroth, you scarce could meet his eye
And hold your own; and were he wroth indeed,
You held it less, or not at all. I say,
Your father had a will that beat men down;
Your father had a brain that beat men down--

POLE. Not me, my Lord.

HOWARD.                No, for you were not here;
You sit upon this fallen Cranmer's throne;
And it would more become you, my Lord Legate,
To join a voice, so potent with her Highness,
To ours in plea for Cranmer than to stand
On naked self-assertion.

MARY.                    All your voices
Are waves on flint. The heretic must burn.

HOWARD. Yet once he saved your Majesty's own life;
Stood out against the King in your behalf.
At his own peril.

MARY.             I know not if he did;
And if he did I care not, my Lord Howard.
My life is not so happy, no such boon,
That I should spare to take a heretic priest's,
Who saved it or not saved. Why do you vex me?

PAGET. Yet to save Cranmer were to serve the Church,
Your Majesty's I mean; he is effaced,
Self-blotted out; so wounded in his honour,
He can but creep down into some dark hole
Like a hurt beast, and hide himself and die;
But if you burn him,--well, your Highness knows
The saying, 'Martyr's blood--seed of the Church.'

MARY. Of the true Church; but his is none, nor will be.
You are too politic for me, my Lord Paget.
And if he have to live so loath'd a life,
It were more merciful to burn him now.

THIRLBY. O yet relent. O, Madam, if you knew him
As I do, ever gentle, and so gracious,
With all his learning--

MARY.                  Yet a heretic still.
His learning makes his burning the more just.

THIRLBY. So worshipt of all those that came across him;
The stranger at his hearth, and all his house--

MARY. His children and his concubine, belike.

THIRLBY. To do him any wrong was to beget
A kindness from him, for his heart was rich,
Of such fine mould, that if you sow'd therein
The seed of Hate, it blossom'd Charity.

POLE. 'After his kind it costs him nothing,' there's
An old world English adage to the point.
These are but natural graces, my good Bishop,
Which in the Catholic garden are as flowers,
But on the heretic dunghill only weeds.

HOWARD. Such weeds make dunghills gracious.

MARY.                                       Enough, my Lords.
It is God's will, the Holy Father's will,
And Philip's will, and mine, that he should burn.
He is pronounced anathema.

HOWARD.                    Farewell, Madam,
God grant you ampler mercy at your call
Than you have shown to Cranmer.
                                   [_Exeunt_ LORDS.

POLE.                           After this,
Your Grace will hardly care to overlook
This same petition of the foreign exiles
For Cranmer's life.

MARY.               Make out the writ to-night.

                                          [_Exeunt_.



SCENE II.--OXFORD. CRANMER IN PRISON.


CRANMER. Last night, I dream'd the faggots were alight,
And that myself was fasten'd to the stake, I
And found it all a visionary flame,
Cool as the light in old decaying wood;
And then King Harry look'd from out a cloud,
And bad me have good courage; and I heard
An angel cry 'There is more joy in Heaven,'--
And after that, the trumpet of the dead.
                                    [_Trumpets without_.
Why, there are trumpets blowing now: what is it?

    _Enter_ FATHER COLE.

COLE. Cranmer, I come to question you again;
Have you remain'd in the true Catholic faith
I left you in?

CRANMER.       In the true Catholic faith,
By Heaven's grace, I am more and more confirm'd.
Why are the trumpets blowing, Father Cole?

COLE. Cranmer, it is decided by the Council
That you to-day should read your recantation
Before the people in St. Mary's Church.
And there be many heretics in the town,
Who loathe you for your late return to Rome,
And might assail you passing through the street,
And tear you piecemeal: so you have a guard.

CRANMER. Or seek to rescue me. I thank the Council.

COLE. Do you lack any money?

CRANMER.                     Nay, why should I?
The prison fare is good enough for me.

COLE. Ay, but to give the poor.

CRANMER.                        Hand it me, then!
I thank you.

COLE.        For a little space, farewell;
Until I see you in St. Mary's Church.
                                 [_Exit_ COLE.

CRANMER. It is against all precedent to burn
One who recants; they mean to pardon me.
To give the poor--they give the poor who die.
Well, burn me or not burn me I am fixt;
It is but a communion, not a mass:
A holy supper, not a sacrifice;
No man can make his Maker--Villa Garcia.

    _Enter_ VILLA GARCIA.

VILLA GARCIA. Pray you write out this paper for me, Cranmer.

CRANMER. Have I not writ enough to satisfy you?

VILLA GARCIA. It is the last.

CRANMER.                      Give it me, then.
                                           [_He writes_.

VILLA GARCIA.                                   Now sign.

CRANMER. I have sign'd enough, and I will sign no more.

VILLA GARCIA. It is no more than what you have sign'd already,
The public form thereof.

CRANMER.                 It may be so;
I sign it with my presence, if I read it.

VILLA GARCIA. But this is idle of you. Well, sir, well,
You are to beg the people to pray for you;
Exhort them to a pure and virtuous life;
Declare the Queen's right to the throne; confess
Your faith before all hearers; and retract
That Eucharistic doctrine in your book.
Will you not sign it now?

CRANMER.                  No, Villa Garcia,
I sign no more. Will they have mercy on me?

VILLA GARCIA. Have you good hopes of mercy!
So, farewell.
                 [_Exit_.

CRANMER. Good hopes, not theirs, have I that I am fixt,
Fixt beyond fall; however, in strange hours,
After the long brain-dazing colloquies,
And thousand-times recurring argument
Of those two friars ever in my prison,
When left alone in my despondency,
Without a friend, a book, my faith would seem
Dead or half-drown'd, or else swam heavily
Against the huge corruptions of the Church,
Monsters of mistradition, old enough
To scare me into dreaming, 'what am I,
Cranmer, against whole ages?' was it so,
Or am I slandering my most inward friend,
To veil the fault of my most outward foe--
The soft and tremulous coward in the flesh?
O higher, holier, earlier, purer church,
I have found thee and not leave thee any more.
It is but a communion, not a mass--
No sacrifice, but a life-giving feast!
(_Writes_.) So, so; this will I say--thus will I pray.
                                           [_Puts up the paper_.

    _Enter_ BONNER.

BONNER. Good day, old friend; what, you look somewhat worn;
And yet it is a day to test your health
Ev'n at the best: I scarce have spoken with you
Since when?--your degradation. At your trial
Never stood up a bolder man than you;
You would not cap the Pope's commissioner--
Your learning, and your stoutness, and your heresy,
Dumbfounded half of us. So, after that,
We had to dis-archbishop and unlord,
And make you simple Cranmer once again.
The common barber dipt your hair, and I
Scraped from your finger-points the holy oil;
And worse than all, you had to kneel to _me_;
Which was not pleasant for you, Master Cranmer.
Now you, that would not recognise the Pope,
And you, that would not own the Real Presence,
Have found a real presence in the stake,
Which frights you back into the ancient faith:
And so you have recanted to the Pope.
How are the mighty fallen, Master Cranmer!

CRANMER. You have been more fierce against the Pope than I;
But why fling back the stone he strikes me with?
    [_Aside_.
O Bonner, if I ever did you kindness--
Power hath been given you to try faith by fire--
Pray you, remembering how yourself have changed,
Be somewhat pitiful, after I have gone,
To the poor flock--to women and to children--
That when I was archbishop held with me.

BONNER. Ay--gentle as they call you--live or die!
Pitiful to this pitiful heresy?
I must obey the Queen and Council, man.
Win thro' this day with honour to yourself,
And I'll say something for you--so--good-bye.
                                         [_Exit_.

CRANMER. This hard coarse man of old hath crouch'd to me
Till I myself was half ashamed for him.

    _Enter_ THIRLBY.

Weep not, good Thirlby.

THIRLBY.                Oh, my Lord, my Lord!
My heart is no such block as Bonner's is:
Who would not weep?

CRANMER.            Why do you so my--lord me,
Who am disgraced?

THIRLBY.          On earth; but saved in heaven
By your recanting.

CRANMER.           Will they burn me, Thirlby?

THIRLBY. Alas, they will; these burnings will not help
The purpose of the faith; but my poor voice
Against them is a whisper to the roar
Of a spring-tide.

CRANMER.          And they will surely burn me?

THIRLBY. Ay; and besides, will have you in the church
Repeat your recantation in the ears
Of all men, to the saving of their souls,
Before your execution. May God help you
Thro' that hard hour!

CRANMER.              And may God bless you, Thirlby!
Well, they shall hear my recantation there.

                                 [_Exit_ THIRLBY.

Disgraced, dishonour'd!--not by them, indeed,
By mine own self--by mine own hand!
O thin-skinn'd hand and jutting veins, 'twas you
That sign'd the burning of poor Joan of Kent;
But then she was a witch. You have written much,
But you were never raised to plead for Frith,
Whose dogmas I have reach'd: he was deliver'd
To the secular arm to burn; and there was Lambert;
Who can foresee himself? truly these burnings,
As Thirlby says, are profitless to the burners,
And help the other side. You shall burn too,
Burn first when I am burnt.
Fire--inch by inch to die in agony! Latimer
Had a brief end--not Ridley. Hooper burn'd
Three-quarters of an hour. Will my faggots
Be wet as his were? It is a day of rain.
I will not muse upon it.
My fancy takes the burner's part, and makes
The fire seem even crueller than it is.
No, I not doubt that God will give me strength,
Albeit I have denied him.

    _Enter_ SOTO _and_ VILLA GARCIA.

VILLA GARCIA.             We are ready
To take you to St. Mary's, Master Cranmer.

CRANMER. And I: lead on; ye loose me from my bonds.

                                           [_Exeunt_.



SCENE III.--ST. MARY'S CHURCH.

COLE _in the Pulpit_, LORD WILLIAMS OF THAME _presiding_. LORD WILLIAM
HOWARD, LORD PAGET, _and others_. CRANMER _enters between_ SOTO _and_
VILLA GARCIA, _and the whole Choir strike up_ 'Nunc Dimittis.' CRANMER
_is set upon a Scaffold before the people_.


COLE. Behold him--
              [_A pause: people in the foreground_.

PEOPLE. Oh, unhappy sight!

FIRST PROTESTANT. See how the tears run down his fatherly face.

SECOND PROTESTANT. James, didst thou ever see a carrion crow Stand
watching a sick beast before he dies?

FIRST PROTESTANT. Him perch'd up there? I wish some thunderbolt Would
make this Cole a cinder, pulpit and all.

COLE. Behold him, brethren: he hath cause to weep!--
So have we all: weep with him if ye will,
Yet--
It is expedient for one man to die,
Yea, for the people, lest the people die.
Yet wherefore should he die that hath return'd
To the one Catholic Universal Church,
Repentant of his errors?

PROTESTANT _murmurs_. Ay, tell us that.

COLE. Those of the wrong side will despise the man,
Deeming him one that thro' the fear of death
Gave up his cause, except he seal his faith
In sight of all with flaming martyrdom.

CRANMER. Ay.

COLE.        Ye hear him, and albeit there may seem
According to the canons pardon due
To him that so repents, yet are there causes
Wherefore our Queen and Council at this time
Adjudge him to the death. He hath been a traitor,
A shaker and confounder of the realm;
And when the King's divorce was sued at Rome,
He here, this heretic metropolitan,
As if he had been the Holy Father, sat
And judged it. Did I call him heretic?
A huge heresiarch! never was it known
That any man so writing, preaching so,
So poisoning the Church, so long continuing,
Hath found his pardon; therefore he must die,
For warning and example.
                         Other reasons
There be for this man's ending, which our Queen
And Council at this present deem it not
Expedient to be known.

PROTESTANT _murmurs_.  I warrant you.

COLE. Take therefore, all, example by this man,
For if our Holy Queen not pardon him,
Much less shall others in like cause escape,
That all of you, the highest as the lowest,
May learn there is no power against the Lord.
There stands a man, once of so high degree,
Chief prelate of our Church, archbishop, first
In Council, second person in the realm,
Friend for so long time of a mighty King;
And now ye see downfallen and debased
From councillor to caitiff--fallen so low,
The leprous flutterings of the byway, scum
And offal of the city would not change
Estates with him; in brief, so miserable,
There is no hope of better left for him,
No place for worse.
                    Yet, Cranmer, be thou glad.
This is the work of God. He is glorified
In thy conversion: lo! thou art reclaim'd;
He brings thee home: nor fear but that to-day
Thou shalt receive the penitent thief's award,
And be with Christ the Lord in Paradise.
Remember how God made the fierce fire seem
To those three children like a pleasant dew.
Remember, too,
The triumph of St. Andrew on his cross,
The patience of St. Lawrence in the fire.
Thus, if thou call on God and all the saints,
God will beat down the fury of the flame,
Or give thee saintly strength to undergo.
And for thy soul shall masses here be sung
By every priest in Oxford. Pray for him.

CRANMER. Ay, one and all, dear brothers, pray for me;
Pray with one breath, one heart, one soul for me.

COLE. And now, lest anyone among you doubt
The man's conversion and remorse of heart,
Yourselves shall hear him speak. Speak, Master Cranmer,
Fulfil your promise made me, and proclaim
Your true undoubted faith, that all may hear.

CRANMER. And that I will. O God, Father of Heaven!
O Son of God, Redeemer of the world!
O Holy Ghost! proceeding from them both,
Three persons and one God, have mercy on me,
Most miserable sinner, wretched man.
I have offended against heaven and earth
More grievously than any tongue can tell.
Then whither should I flee for any help?
I am ashamed to lift my eyes to heaven,
And I can find no refuge upon earth.
Shall I despair then?--God forbid! O God,
For thou art merciful, refusing none
That come to Thee for succour, unto Thee,
Therefore, I come; humble myself to Thee;
Saying, O Lord God, although my sins be great,
For thy great mercy have mercy! O God the Son,
Not for slight faults alone, when thou becamest
Man in the Flesh, was the great mystery wrought;
O God the Father, not for little sins
Didst thou yield up thy Son to human death;
But for the greatest sin that can be sinn'd,
Yea, even such as mine, incalculable,
Unpardonable,--sin against the light,
The truth of God, which I had proven and known.
Thy mercy must be greater than all sin.
Forgive me, Father, for no merit of mine,
But that Thy name by man be glorified,
And Thy most blessed Son's, who died for man.

Good people, every man at time of death
Would fain set forth some saying that may live
After his death and better humankind;
For death gives life's last word a power to live,
And, like the stone-cut epitaph, remain
After the vanish'd voice, and speak to men.
God grant me grace to glorify my God!
And first I say it is a grievous case,
Many so dote upon this bubble world,
Whose colours in a moment break and fly,
They care for nothing else. What saith St. John:
'Love of this world is hatred against God.'
Again, I pray you all that, next to God,
You do unmurmuringly and willingly
Obey your King and Queen, and not for dread
Of these alone, but from the fear of Him
Whose ministers they be to govern you.
Thirdly, I pray you all to live together
Like brethren; yet what hatred Christian men
Bear to each other, seeming not as brethren,
But mortal foes! But do you good to all
As much as in you lieth. Hurt no man more
Than you would harm your loving natural brother
Of the same roof, same breast. If any do,
Albeit he think himself at home with God,
Of this be sure, he is whole worlds away.

PROTESTANT _murmurs_. What sort of brothers then be those that lust
To burn each other?

WILLIAMS.           Peace among you, there!

CRANMER. Fourthly, to those that own exceeding wealth,
Remember that sore saying spoken once
By Him that was the truth, 'How hard it is
For the rich man to enter into Heaven;'
Let all rich men remember that hard word.
I have not time for more: if ever, now
Let them flow forth in charity, seeing now
The poor so many, and all food so dear.
Long have I lain in prison, yet have heard
Of all their wretchedness. Give to the poor,
Ye give to God. He is with us in the poor.

And now, and forasmuch as I have come
To the last end of life, and thereupon
Hangs all my past, and all my life to be,
Either to live with Christ in Heaven with joy,
Or to be still in pain with devils in hell;
And, seeing in a moment, I shall find
                                       [_Pointing upwards_.
Heaven or else hell ready to swallow me,
                                  [_Pointing downwards_.
I shall declare to you my very faith
Without all colour.

COLE.               Hear him, my good brethren.

CRANMER. I do believe in God, Father of all;
In every article of the Catholic faith,
And every syllable taught us by our Lord,
His prophets, and apostles, in the Testaments,
Both Old and New.

COLE.           Be plainer, Master Cranmer.

CRANMER. And now I come to the great cause that weighs
Upon my conscience more than anything
Or said or done in all my life by me;
For there be writings I have set abroad
Against the truth I knew within my heart,
Written for fear of death, to save my life,
If that might be; the papers by my hand
Sign'd since my degradation--by this hand
                     [_Holding out his right hand_.
Written and sign'd--I here renounce them all;
And, since my hand offended, having written
Against my heart, my hand shall first be burnt,
So I may come to the fire.
                              [_Dead silence_.

    PROTESTANT _murmurs_.

FIRST PROTESTANT. I knew it would be so.

SECOND PROTESTANT.                       Our prayers are heard!

THIRD PROTESTANT. God bless him!

CATHOLIC _murmurs_.              Out upon him! out upon him!
Liar! dissembler! traitor! to the fire!

WILLIAMS (_raising his voice_).
You know that you recanted all you said
Touching the sacrament in that same book
You wrote against my Lord of Winchester;
Dissemble not; play the plain Christian man.

CRANMER. Alas, my Lord,
I have been a man loved plainness all my life;
I _did_ dissemble, but the hour has come
For utter truth and plainness; wherefore, I say,
I hold by all I wrote within that book.
Moreover,
As for the Pope I count him Antichrist,
With all his devil's doctrines; and refuse,
Reject him, and abhor him. I have said.

[_Cries on all sides_, 'Pull him down! Away with him!'

COLE. Ay, stop the heretic's mouth! Hale him away!

WILLIAMS. Harm him not, harm him not! have him to the fire!

    [CRANMER _goes out between Two Friars, smiling; hands are
    reached to him from the crowd_. LORD WILLIAM HOWARD _and_
    LORD PAGET _are left alone in the church_.

PAGET. The nave and aisles all empty as a fool's jest!
No, here's Lord William Howard. What, my Lord,
You have not gone to see the burning?

HOWARD.                               Fie!
To stand at ease, and stare as at a show,
And watch a good man burn. Never again.
I saw the deaths of Latimer and Ridley.
Moreover, tho' a Catholic, I would not,
For the pure honour of our common nature,
Hear what I might--another recantation
Of Cranmer at the stake.

PAGET.                   You'd not hear that.
He pass'd out smiling, and he walk'd upright;
His eye was like a soldier's, whom the general
He looks to and he leans on as his God,
Hath rated for some backwardness and bidd'n him
Charge one against a thousand, and the man
Hurls his soil'd life against the pikes and dies.

HOWARD. Yet that he might not after all those papers
Of recantation yield again, who knows?

PAGET. Papers of recantation! Think you then
That Cranmer read all papers that he sign'd?
Or sign'd all those they tell us that he sign'd?
Nay, I trow not: and you shall see, my Lord,
That howsoever hero-like the man
Dies in the fire, this Bonner or another
Will in some lying fashion misreport
His ending to the glory of their church.
And you saw Latimer and Ridley die?
Latimer was eighty, was he not? his best
Of life was over then.

HOWARD.                His eighty years
Look'd somewhat crooked on him in his frieze;
But after they had stript him to his shroud,
He stood upright, a lad of twenty-one,
And gather'd with his hands the starting flame,
And wash'd his hands and all his face therein,
Until the powder suddenly blew him dead.
Ridley was longer burning; but he died
As manfully and boldly, and, 'fore God,
I know them heretics, but right English ones.
If ever, as heaven grant, we clash with Spain,
Our Ridley-soldiers and our Latimer-sailors
Will teach her something.

PAGET.                    Your mild Legate Pole
Will tell you that the devil helpt them thro' it.
              [_A murmur of the Crowd in the distance_.
Hark, how those Roman wolfdogs howl and bay him!

HOWARD. Might it not be the other side rejoicing
In his brave end?

PAGET.            They are too crush'd, too broken,
They can but weep in silence.

HOWARD.                       Ay, ay, Paget,
They have brought it in large measure on themselves.
Have I not heard them mock the blessed Host
In songs so lewd, the beast might roar his claim
To being in God's image, more than they?
Have I not seen the gamekeeper, the groom.
Gardener, and huntsman, in the parson's place,
The parson from his own spire swung out dead,
And Ignorance crying in the streets, and all men
Regarding her? I say they have drawn the fire
On their own heads: yet, Paget, I do hold
The Catholic, if he have the greater right,
Hath been the crueller.

PAGET.                  Action and re-action,
The miserable see-saw of our child-world,
Make us despise it at odd hours, my Lord.
Heaven help that this re-action not re-act
Yet fiercelier under Queen Elizabeth,
So that she come to rule us.

HOWARD.                      The world's mad.

PAGET. My Lord, the world is like a drunken man,
Who cannot move straight to his end--but reels
Now to the right, then as far to the left,
Push'd by the crowd beside--and underfoot
An earthquake; for since Henry for a doubt--
Which a young lust had clapt upon the back,
Crying, 'Forward!'--set our old church rocking, men
Have hardly known what to believe, or whether
They should believe in anything; the currents
So shift and change, they see not how they are borne,
Nor whither. I conclude the King a beast;
Verily a lion if you will--the world
A most obedient beast and fool--myself
Half beast and fool as appertaining to it;
Altho' your Lordship hath as little of each
Cleaving to your original Adam-clay,
As may be consonant with mortality.

HOWARD. We talk and Cranmer suffers.
The kindliest man I ever knew; see, see,
I speak of him in the past. Unhappy land!
Hard-natured Queen, half-Spanish in herself,
And grafted on the hard-grain'd stock of Spain--
Her life, since Philip left her, and she lost
Her fierce desire of bearing him a child,
Hath, like a brief and bitter winter's day,
Gone narrowing down and darkening to a close.
There will be more conspiracies, I fear.

PAGET. Ay, ay, beware of France.

HOWARD.                          O Paget, Paget!
I have seen heretics of the poorer sort,
Expectant of the rack from day to day,
To whom the fire were welcome, lying chain'd
In breathless dungeons over steaming sewers,
Fed with rank bread that crawl'd upon the tongue,
And putrid water, every drop a worm,
Until they died of rotted limbs; and then
Cast on the dunghill naked, and become
Hideously alive again from head to heel,
Made even the carrion-nosing mongrel vomit
With hate and horror.

PAGET.                Nay, you sicken _me_
To hear you.

HOWARD.      Fancy-sick; these things are done,
Done right against the promise of this Queen
Twice given.

PAGET.       No faith with heretics, my Lord!
Hist! there be two old gossips--gospellers,
I take it; stand behind the pillar here;
I warrant you they talk about the burning.

    _Enter_ TWO OLD WOMEN. JOAN, _and after her_ TIB.

JOAN. Why, it be Tib!

TIB. I cum behind tha, gall, and couldn't make tha hear. Eh, the wind
and the wet! What a day, what a day! nigh upo' judgement daay loike.
Pwoaps be pretty things, Joan, but they wunt set i' the Lord's cheer
o' that daay.

JOAN. I must set down myself, Tib; it be a var waay vor my owld legs
up vro' Islip. Eh, my rheumatizy be that bad howiver be I to win to
the burnin'.

TIB. I should saay 'twur ower by now. I'd ha' been here avore, but
Dumble wur blow'd wi' the wind, and Dumble's the best milcher in
Islip.

JOAN. Our Daisy's as good 'z her.

TIB. Noa, Joan.

JOAN. Our Daisy's butter's as good'z hern.

TIB. Noa, Joan.

JOAN. Our Daisy's cheeses be better.

TIB. Noa, Joan.

JOAN. Eh, then ha' thy waay wi' me, Tib; ez thou hast wi' thy owld
man.

TIB. Ay, Joan, and my owld man wur up and awaay betimes wi' dree hard
eggs for a good pleace at the burnin'; and barrin' the wet, Hodge 'ud
ha' been a-harrowin' o' white peasen i' the outfield--and barrin' the
wind, Dumble wur blow'd wi' the wind, so 'z we was forced to stick
her, but we fetched her round at last. Thank the Lord therevore.
Dumble's the best milcher in Islip.

JOAN. Thou's thy way wi' man and beast, Tib. I wonder at tha', it
beats me! Eh, but I do know ez Pwoaps and vires be bad things; tell
'ee now, I heerd summat as summun towld summun o' owld Bishop
Gardiner's end; there wur an owld lord a-cum to dine wi' un, and a wur
so owld a couldn't bide vor his dinner, but a had to bide howsomiver,
vor 'I wunt dine,' says my Lord Bishop, says he, 'not till I hears ez
Latimer and Ridley be a-vire;' and so they bided on and on till vour
o' the clock, till his man cum in post vro' here, and tells un ez the
vire has tuk holt. 'Now,' says the Bishop, says he, 'we'll gwo to
dinner;' and the owld lord fell to 's meat wi' a will, God bless un!
but Gardiner wur struck down like by the hand o' God avore a could
taste a mossel, and a set un all a-vire, so 'z the tongue on un cum
a-lolluping out o' 'is mouth as black as a rat. Thank the Lord,
therevore.

PAGET. The fools!

TIB. Ay, Joan; and Queen Mary gwoes on a-burnin' and a-burnin', to get
her baaby born; but all her burnin's 'ill never burn out the hypocrisy
that makes the water in her. There's nought but the vire of God's hell
ez can burn out that.

JOAN. Thank the Lord, therevore.

PAGET. The fools!

TIB. A-burnin', and a-burnin', and a-makin' o' volk madder and madder;
but tek thou my word vor't, Joan,--and I bean't wrong not twice i' ten
year--the burnin' o' the owld archbishop'll burn the Pwoap out o'
this 'ere land vor iver and iver.

HOWARD. Out of the church, you brace of cursed crones, Or I will have
you duck'd! (_Women hurry out_.) Said I not right? For how should
reverend prelate or throned prince Brook for an hour such brute
malignity? Ah, what an acrid wine has Luther brew'd!

PAGET. Pooh, pooh, my Lord! poor garrulous country-wives.
Buy you their cheeses, and they'll side with you;
You cannot judge the liquor from the lees.

HOWARD. I think that in some sort we may. But see,

    _Enter_ PETERS.

Peters, my gentleman, an honest Catholic,
Who follow'd with the crowd to Cranmer's fire.
One that would neither misreport nor lie,
Not to gain paradise: no, nor if the Pope,
Charged him to do it--he is white as death.
Peters, how pale you look! you bring the smoke
Of Cranmer's burning with you.

PETERS.                        Twice or thrice
The smoke of Cranmer's burning wrapt me round.

HOWARD. Peters, you know me Catholic, but English.
Did he die bravely? Tell me that, or leave
All else untold.

PETERS.          My Lord, he died most bravely.

HOWARD. Then tell me all.

PAGET.                    Ay, Master Peters, tell us.

PETERS. You saw him how he past among the crowd;
And ever as he walk'd the Spanish friars
Still plied him with entreaty and reproach:
But Cranmer, as the helmsman at the helm
Steers, ever looking to the happy haven
Where he shall rest at night, moved to his death;
And I could see that many silent hands
Came from the crowd and met his own; and thus
When we had come where Ridley burnt with Latimer,
He, with a cheerful smile, as one whose mind
Is all made up, in haste put off the rags
They had mock'd his misery with, and all in white,
His long white beard, which he had never shaven
Since Henry's death, down-sweeping to the chain,
Wherewith they bound him to the stake, he stood
More like an ancient father of the Church,
Than heretic of these times; and still the friars
Plied him, but Cranmer only shook his head,
Or answer'd them in smiling negatives;
Whereat Lord Williams gave a sudden cry:--
'Make short! make short!' and so they lit the wood.
Then Cranmer lifted his left hand to heaven,
And thrust his right into the bitter flame;
And crying, in his deep voice, more than once,
'This hath offended--this unworthy hand!'
So held it till it all was burn'd, before
The flame had reach'd his body; I stood near--
Mark'd him--he never uttered moan of pain:
He never stirr'd or writhed, but, like a statue,
Unmoving in the greatness of the flame,
Gave up the ghost; and so past martyr-like--
Martyr I may not call him--past--but whither?
PAGET. To purgatory, man, to purgatory.

PETERS. Nay, but, my Lord, he denied purgatory.

PAGET. Why then to heaven, and God ha' mercy on him.

HOWARD. Paget, despite his fearful heresies,
I loved the man, and needs must moan for him;
O Cranmer!

PAGET.     But your moan is useless now:
Come out, my Lord, it is a world of fools.

                                      [_Exeunt_.




ACT V.


SCENE I.--LONDON. HALL IN THE PALACE.

QUEEN, SIR NICHOLAS HEATH.


HEATH. Madam,
I do assure you, that it must be look'd to:
Calais is but ill-garrison'd, in Guisnes
Are scarce two hundred men, and the French fleet
Rule in the narrow seas. It must be look'd to,
If war should fall between yourself and France;
Or you will lose your Calais.

MARY.                         It shall be look'd to;
I wish you a good morning, good Sir Nicholas:
Here is the King.
                     [_Exit_ HEATH.

    _Enter_ PHILIP.

PHILIP.           Sir Nicholas tells you true,
And you must look to Calais when I go.

MARY. Go? must you go, indeed--again--so soon?
Why, nature's licensed vagabond, the swallow,
That might live always in the sun's warm heart,
Stays longer here in our poor north than you:--
Knows where he nested--ever comes again.

PHILIP. And, Madam, so shall I.

MARY.                           O, will you? will you?
I am faint with fear that you will come no more.

PHILIP. Ay, ay; but many voices call me hence.

MARY. Voices--I hear unhappy rumours--nay,
I say not, I believe. What voices call you
Dearer than mine that should be dearest to you?
Alas, my Lord! what voices and how many?

PHILIP. The voices of Castille and Aragon,
Granada, Naples, Sicily, and Milan,--
The voices of Franche-Comte, and the Netherlands,
The voices of Peru and Mexico,
Tunis, and Oran, and the Philippines,
And all the fair spice-islands of the East.

MARY (_admiringly_).
You are the mightiest monarch upon earth,
I but a little Queen: and, so indeed,
Need you the more.

PHILIP.            A little Queen! but when
I came to wed your majesty, Lord Howard,
Sending an insolent shot that dash'd the seas
Upon us, made us lower our kingly flag
To yours of England.

MARY.                Howard is all English!
There is no king, not were he ten times king,
Ten times our husband, but must lower his flag
To that of England in the seas of England.

PHILIP. Is that your answer?

MARY.                        Being Queen of England,
I have none other.

PHILIP.            So.

MARY.                  But wherefore not
Helm the huge vessel of your state, my liege,
Here by the side of her who loves you most?

PHILIP. No, Madam, no! a candle in the sun
Is all but smoke--a star beside the moon
Is all but lost; your people will not crown me--
Your people are as cheerless as your clime;
Hate me and mine: witness the brawls, the gibbets.
Here swings a Spaniard--there an Englishman;
The peoples are unlike as their complexion;
Yet will I be your swallow and return--
But now I cannot bide.

MARY.                  Not to help _me?_
They hate _me_ also for my love to you,
My Philip; and these judgments on the land--
Harvestless autumns, horrible agues, plague--

PHILIP. The blood and sweat of heretics at the stake
Is God's best dew upon the barren field.
Burn more!

MARY.      I will, I will; and you will stay?

PHILIP. Have I not said? Madam, I came to sue
Your Council and yourself to declare war.

MARY. Sir, there are many English in your ranks
To help your battle.

PHILIP.              So far, good. I say
I came to sue your Council and yourself
To declare war against the King of France.

MARY. Not to see me?

PHILIP.              Ay, Madam, to see you.
Unalterably and pesteringly fond!    [_Aside_.
But, soon or late you must have war with France;
King Henry warms your traitors at his hearth.
Carew is there, and Thomas Stafford there.
Courtenay, belike--

MARY.              A fool and featherhead!

PHILIP. Ay, but they use his name. In brief, this Henry
Stirs up your land against you to the intent
That you may lose your English heritage.
And then, your Scottish namesake marrying
The Dauphin, he would weld France, England, Scotland,
Into one sword to hack at Spain and me.

MARY. And yet the Pope is now colleagued with France;
You make your wars upon him down in Italy:--
Philip, can that be well?

PHILIP.                   Content you, Madam;
You must abide my judgment, and my father's,
Who deems it a most just and holy war.
The Pope would cast the Spaniard out of Naples:
He calls us worse than Jews, Moors, Saracens.
The Pope has pushed his horns beyond his mitre--
Beyond his province. Now,
Duke Alva will but touch him on the horns,
And he withdraws; and of his holy head--
For Alva is true son of the true church--
No hair is harm'd. Will you not help me here?

MARY. Alas! the Council will not hear of war.
They say your wars are not the wars of England.
They will not lay more taxes on a land
So hunger-nipt and wretched; and you know
The crown is poor. We have given the church-lands back:
The nobles would not; nay, they clapt their hands
Upon their swords when ask'd; and therefore God
Is hard upon the people. What's to be done?
Sir, I will move them in your cause again,
And we will raise us loans and subsidies
Among the merchants; and Sir Thomas Gresham
Will aid us. There is Antwerp and the Jews.

PHILIP. Madam, my thanks.

MARY.                     And you will stay your going?

PHILIP. And further to discourage and lay lame
The plots of France, altho' you love her not,
You must proclaim Elizabeth your heir.
She stands between you and the Queen of Scots.

MARY. The Queen of Scots at least is Catholic.

PHILIP. Ay, Madam, Catholic; but I will not have
The King of France the King of England too.

MARY. But she's a heretic, and, when I am gone,
Brings the new learning back.

PHILIP.                       It must be done.
You must proclaim Elizabeth your heir.

MARY. Then it is done; but you will stay your going
Somewhat beyond your settled purpose?

PHILIP.                               No!

MARY. What, not one day?

PHILIP.                  You beat upon the rock.

MARY. And I am broken there.

PHILIP.                   Is this a place
To wail in, Madam? what! a public hall.
Go in, I pray you.

MARY.              Do not seem so changed.
Say go; but only say it lovingly.

PHILIP. You do mistake. I am not one to change.
I never loved you more.

MARY.                   Sire, I obey you.
Come quickly.

PHILIP.       Ay.
                     [_Exit_ MARY.

    _Enter_ COUNT DE FERIA.

FERIA (_aside_).  The Queen in tears!

PHILIP.                               Feria!
Hast thou not mark'd--come closer to mine ear--
How doubly aged this Queen of ours hath grown
Since she lost hope of bearing us a child?

FERIA. Sire, if your Grace hath mark'd it, so have I.

PHILIP. Hast thou not likewise mark'd Elizabeth,
How fair and royal--like a Queen, indeed?

FERIA. Allow me the same answer as before--
That if your Grace hath mark'd her, so have I.

PHILIP. Good, now; methinks my Queen is like enough
To leave me by and by.

FERIA.                 To leave you, sire?

PHILIP. I mean not like to live. Elizabeth--
To Philibert of Savoy, as you know,
We meant to wed her; but I am not sure
She will not serve me better--so my Queen
Would leave me--as--my wife.

FERIA.                       Sire, even so.

PHILIP. She will not have Prince Philibert of Savoy.

FERIA. No, sire.

PHILIP.          I have to pray you, some odd time,
To sound the Princess carelessly on this;
Not as from me, but as your phantasy;
And tell me how she takes it.

FERIA.                         Sire, I will.

PHILIP. I am not certain but that Philibert
Shall be the man; and I shall urge his suit
Upon the Queen, because I am not certain:
You understand, Feria.

FERIA.                 Sire, I do.

PHILIP. And if you be not secret in this matter,
You understand me there, too?

FERIA.                        Sire, I do.

PHILIP. You must be sweet and supple, like a Frenchman.
She is none of those who loathe the honeycomb.

                                      [_Exit_ FERIA.

    _Enter_ RENARD.

RENARD. My liege, I bring you goodly tidings.

PHILIP. Well?

RENARD. There _will_ be war with France, at last, my liege;
Sir Thomas Stafford, a bull-headed ass,
Sailing from France, with thirty Englishmen,
Hath taken Scarboro' Castle, north of York;
Proclaims himself protector, and affirms
The Queen has forfeited her right to reign
By marriage with an alien--other things
As idle; a weak Wyatt! Little doubt
This buzz will soon be silenced; but the Council
(I have talk'd with some already) are for war.
This the fifth conspiracy hatch'd in France;
They show their teeth upon it; and your Grace,
So you will take advice of mine, should stay
Yet for awhile, to shape and guide the event.

PHILIP. Good! Renard, I will stay then.

RENARD.                                 Also, sire,
Might I not say--to please your wife, the Queen?

PHILIP. Ay, Renard, if you care to put it so.

                                         [_Exeunt_.



SCENE II.--A ROOM IN THE PALACE.

MARY, _sitting: a rose in her hand_. LADY CLARENCE. ALICE _in the
background_.


MARY. Look! I have play'd with this poor rose so long
I have broken off the head.

LADY CLARENCE. Your Grace hath been
More merciful to many a rebel head
That should have fallen, and may rise again.

MARY. There were not many hang'd for Wyatt's rising.

LADY CLARENCE. Nay, not two hundred.

MARY.                                I could weep for them
And her, and mine own self and all the world.

LADY CLARENCE. For her? for whom, your Grace?

    _Enter_ USHER.

USHER. The Cardinal.

    _Enter_ CARDINAL POLE. (MARY _rises_.)

MARY. Reginald Pole, what news hath plagued thy heart?
What makes thy favour like the bloodless head
Fall'n on the block, and held up by the hair?
Philip?--

POLE.    No, Philip is as warm in life
As ever.

MARY.    Ay, and then as cold as ever.
Is Calais taken?

POLE.            Cousin, there hath chanced
A sharper harm to England and to Rome,
Than Calais taken. Julius the Third
Was ever just, and mild, and father-like;
But this new Pope Caraffa, Paul the Fourth,
Not only reft me of that legateship
Which Julius gave me, and the legateship
Annex'd to Canterbury--nay, but worse--
And yet I must obey the Holy Father,
And so must you, good cousin;--worse than all,
A passing bell toll'd in a dying ear--
He hath cited me to Rome, for heresy,
Before his Inquisition.

MARY.                   I knew it, cousin,
But held from you all papers sent by Rome,
That you might rest among us, till the Pope,
To compass which I wrote myself to Rome,
Reversed his doom, and that you might not seem
To disobey his Holiness.

POLE.                    He hates Philip;
He is all Italian, and he hates the Spaniard;
He cannot dream that _I_ advised the war;
He strikes thro' me at Philip and yourself.
Nay, but I know it of old, he hates me too;
So brands me in the stare of Christendom
A heretic!
Now, even now, when bow'd before my time,
The house half-ruin'd ere the lease be out;
When I should guide the Church in peace at home,
After my twenty years of banishment,
And all my lifelong labour to uphold
The primacy--a heretic. Long ago,
When I was ruler in the patrimony,
I was too lenient to the Lutheran,
And I and learned friends among ourselves
Would freely canvass certain Lutheranisms.
What then, he knew I was no Lutheran.
A heretic!
He drew this shaft against me to the head,
When it was thought I might be chosen Pope,
But then withdrew it. In full consistory,
When I was made Archbishop, he approved me.
And how should he have sent me Legate hither,
Deeming me heretic? and what heresy since?
But he was evermore mine enemy,
And hates the Spaniard--fiery-choleric,
A drinker of black, strong, volcanic wines,
That ever make him fierier. I, a heretic?
Your Highness knows that in pursuing heresy
I have gone beyond your late Lord Chancellor,--
He cried Enough! enough! before his death.--
Gone beyond him and mine own natural man
(It was God's cause); so far they call me now,
The scourge and butcher of their English church.

MARY. Have courage, your reward is Heaven itself.

POLE. They groan amen; they swarm into the fire
Like flies--for what? no dogma. They know nothing;
They burn for nothing.

MARY.                  You have done your best.

POLE. Have done my best, and as a faithful son,
That all day long hath wrought his father's work,
When back he comes at evening hath the door
Shut on him by the father whom he loved,
His early follies cast into his teeth,
And the poor son turn'd out into the street
To sleep, to die--I shall die of it, cousin.

MARY. I pray you be not so disconsolate;
I still will do mine utmost with the Pope.
Poor cousin!
Have not I been the fast friend of your life
Since mine began, and it was thought we two
Might make one flesh, and cleave unto each other
As man and wife?

POLE.            Ah, cousin, I remember
How I would dandle you upon my knee
At lisping-age. I watch'd you dancing once
With your huge father; he look'd the Great Harry,
You but his cockboat; prettily you did it,
And innocently. No--we were not made
One flesh in happiness, no happiness here;
But now we are made one flesh in misery;
Our bridemaids are not lovely--Disappointment,
Ingratitude, Injustice, Evil-tongue,
Labour-in-vain.

MARY.           Surely, not all in vain.
Peace, cousin, peace! I am sad at heart myself.

POLE. Our altar is a mound of dead men's clay,
Dug from the grave that yawns for us beyond;
And there is one Death stands behind the Groom,
And there is one Death stands behind the Bride--

MARY. Have you been looking at the 'Dance of Death'?

POLE. No; but these libellous papers which I found
Strewn in your palace. Look you here--the Pope
Pointing at me with 'Pole, the heretic,
Thou hast burnt others, do thou burn thyself,
Or I will burn thee;' and this other; see!--
'We pray continually for the death
Of our accursed Queen and Cardinal Pole.'
This last--I dare not read it her.    [_Aside_.

MARY.                              Away!
Why do you bring me these?
I thought you knew better. I never read,
I tear them; they come back upon my dreams.
The hands that write them should be burnt clean off
As Cranmer's, and the fiends that utter them
Tongue-torn with pincers, lash'd to death, or lie
Famishing in black cells, while famish'd rats
Eat them alive. Why do they bring me these?
Do you mean to drive me mad?

POLE.                        I had forgotten
How these poor libels trouble you. Your pardon,
Sweet cousin, and farewell! 'O bubble world,
Whose colours in a moment break and fly!'
Why, who said that? I know not--true enough!

    [_Puts up the papers, all but the last, which falls.
    Exit_ POLE.

ALICE. If Cranmer's spirit were a mocking one,
And heard these two, there might be sport for him.    [_Aside_.

MARY. Clarence, they hate me; even while I speak
There lurks a silent dagger, listening
In some dark closet, some long gallery, drawn,
And panting for my blood as I go by.

LADY CLARENCE. Nay, Madam, there be loyal papers too,
And I have often found them.

MARY.                        Find me one!

LADY CLARENCE. Ay, Madam; but Sir Nicholas Heath, the Chancellor,
Would see your Highness.

MARY.                    Wherefore should I see him?

LADY CLARENCE. Well, Madam, he may bring you news from Philip.

MARY. So, Clarence.

LADY CLARENCE.      Let me first put up your hair;
It tumbles all abroad.

MARY.                  And the gray dawn
Of an old age that never will be mine
Is all the clearer seen. No, no; what matters?
Forlorn I am, and let me look forlorn.

    _Enter_ SIR NICHOLAS HEATH.

HEATH. I bring your Majesty such grievous news
I grieve to bring it. Madam, Calais is taken.

MARY. What traitor spoke? Here, let my cousin Pole
Seize him and burn him for a Lutheran.

HEATH. Her Highness is unwell. I will retire.

LADY CLARENCE. Madam, your Chancellor, Sir Nicholas Heath.

MARY. Sir Nicholas! I am stunn'd--Nicholas Heath?
Methought some traitor smote me on the head.
What said you, my good Lord, that our brave English
Had sallied out from Calais and driven back
The Frenchmen from their trenches?

HEATH.                             Alas! no.
That gateway to the mainland over which
Our flag hath floated for two hundred years
Is France again.

MARY.            So; but it is not lost--
Not yet. Send out: let England as of old
Rise lionlike, strike hard and deep into
The prey they are rending from her--ay, and rend
The renders too. Send out, send out, and make
Musters in all the counties; gather all
From sixteen years to sixty; collect the fleet;
Let every craft that carries sail and gun
Steer toward Calais. Guisnes is not taken yet?

HEATH. Guisnes is not taken yet.

MARY.                            There yet is hope.

HEATH. Ah, Madam, but your people are so cold;
I do much fear that England will not care.
Methinks there is no manhood left among us.

MARY. Send out; I am too weak to stir abroad:
Tell my mind to the Council--to the Parliament:
Proclaim it to the winds. Thou art cold thyself
To babble of their coldness. O would I were
My father for an hour! Away now--Quick!

                                   [_Exit_ HEATH.

I hoped I had served God with all my might!
It seems I have not. Ah! much heresy
Shelter'd in Calais. Saints I have rebuilt
Your shrines, set up your broken images;
Be comfortable to me. Suffer not
That my brief reign in England be defamed
Thro' all her angry chronicles hereafter
By loss of Calais. Grant me Calais. Philip,
We have made war upon the Holy Father
All for your sake: what good could come of that?

LADY CLARENCE. No, Madam, not against the Holy Father;
You did but help King Philip's war with France,
Your troops were never down in Italy.

MARY. I am a byword. Heretic and rebel
Point at me and make merry. Philip gone!
And Calais gone! Time that I were gone too!

LADY CLARENCE. Nay, if the fetid gutter had a voice
And cried I was not clean, what should I care?
Or you, for heretic cries? And I believe,
Spite of your melancholy Sir Nicholas,
Your England is as loyal as myself.

MARY (_seeing the paper draft by_ POLE).
There! there! another paper! Said you not
Many of these were loyal? Shall I try
If this be one of such?

LADY CLARENCE.          Let it be, let it be.
God pardon me! I have never yet found one.    [_Aside_.

MARY (_reads_). 'Your people hate you as your husband hates you.'
Clarence, Clarence, what have I done? what sin
Beyond all grace, all pardon? Mother of God,
Thou knowest never woman meant so well,
And fared so ill in this disastrous world.
My people hate me and desire my death.

LADY CLARENCE. No, Madam, no.

MARY. My husband hates me, and desires my death.

LADY CLARENCE. No, Madam; these are libels.

MARY. I hate myself, and I desire my death.

LADY CLARENCE. Long live your Majesty! Shall Alice sing you
One of her pleasant songs? Alice, my child,
Bring us your lute (ALICE _goes_). They say the gloom of Saul
Was lighten'd by young David's harp.

MARY.                                Too young!
And never knew a Philip.

    _Re-enter_ ALICE.

                         Give _me_ the lute.
He hates me!
                (_She sings_.)

    Hapless doom of woman happy in betrothing!
    Beauty passes like a breath and love is lost in loathing:
    Low, my lute; speak low, my lute, but say the world is nothing--
    Low, lute, low!

    Love will hover round the flowers when they first awaken;
    Love will fly the fallen leaf, and not be overtaken;
    Low, my lute! oh low, my lute! we fade and are forsaken--
    Low, dear lute, low!

Take it away! not low enough for me!

ALICE. Your Grace hath a low voice.

MARY.                               How dare you say it?
Even for that he hates me. A low voice
Lost in a wilderness where none can hear!
A voice of shipwreck on a shoreless sea!
A low voice from the dust and from the grave
    (_Sitting on the ground_).
There, am I low enough now?

ALICE. Good Lord! how grim and ghastly looks her Grace,
With both her knees drawn upward to her chin.
There was an old-world tomb beside my father's,
And this was open'd, and the dead were found
Sitting, and in this fashion; she looks a corpse.

    _Enter_ LADY MAGDALEN DACRES.

LADY MAGDALEN. Madam, the Count de Feria waits without,
In hopes to see your Highness.

LADY CLARENCE (_pointing to_ MARY).
Wait he must--
Her trance again. She neither sees nor hears,
And may not speak for hours.

LADY MAGDALEN.               Unhappiest
Of Queens and wives and women!

ALICE (_in the foreground with_ LADY MAGDALEN).
                               And all along
Of Philip.

LADY MAGDALEN. Not so loud! Our Clarence there
Sees ever such an aureole round the Queen,
It gilds the greatest wronger of her peace,
Who stands the nearest to her.

ALICE.                         Ay, this Philip;
I used to love the Queen with all my heart--
God help me, but methinks I love her less
For such a dotage upon such a man.
I would I were as tall and strong as you.

LADY MAGDALEN. I seem half-shamed at times to be so tall.

ALICE. You are the stateliest deer in all the herd--
Beyond his aim--but I am small and scandalous,
And love to hear bad tales of Philip.

LADY MAGDALEN.                        Why?
I never heard him utter worse of you
Than that you were low-statured.

ALICE.                           Does he think
Low stature is low nature, or all women's
Low as his own?

LADY MAGDALEN.  There you strike in the nail.
This coarseness is a want of phantasy.
It is the low man thinks the woman low;
Sin is too dull to see beyond himself.

ALICE. Ah, Magdalen, sin is bold as well as dull.
How dared he?

LADY MAGDALEN. Stupid soldiers oft are bold.
Poor lads, they see not what the general sees,
A risk of utter ruin. I am _not_
Beyond his aim, or was not.

ALICE.                      Who? Not you?
Tell, tell me; save my credit with myself.

LADY MAGDALEN. I never breathed it to a bird in the eaves,
Would not for all the stars and maiden moon
Our drooping Queen should know! In Hampton Court
My window look'd upon the corridor;
And I was robing;--this poor throat of mine,
Barer than I should wish a man to see it,--
When he we speak of drove the window back,
And, like a thief, push'd in his royal hand;
But by God's providence a good stout staff
Lay near me; and you know me strong of arm;
I do believe I lamed his Majesty's
For a day or two, tho', give the Devil his due,
I never found he bore me any spite.

ALICE. I would she could have wedded that poor youth,
My Lord of Devon--light enough, God knows,
And mixt with Wyatt's rising--and the boy
Not out of him--but neither cold, coarse, cruel,
And more than all--no Spaniard.

LADY CLARENCE.                  Not so loud.
Lord Devon, girls! what are you whispering here?

ALICE. Probing an old state-secret--how it chanced
That this young Earl was sent on foreign travel,
Not lost his head.

LADY CLARENCE.     There was no proof against him.

ALICE. Nay, Madam; did not Gardiner intercept
A letter which the Count de Noailles wrote
To that dead traitor Wyatt, with full proof
Of Courtenay's treason? What became of that?

LADY CLARENCE. Some say that Gardiner, out of love for him,
Burnt it, and some relate that it was lost
When Wyatt sack'd the Chancellor's house in Southwark.
Let dead things rest.

ALICE.                Ay, and with him who died
Alone in Italy.

LADY CLARENCE.  Much changed, I hear,
Had put off levity and put graveness on.
The foreign courts report him in his manner
Noble as his young person and old shield.
It might be so--but all is over now;
He caught a chill in the lagoons of Venice,
And died in Padua.

MARY (_looking up suddenly_).
                   Died in the true faith?

LADY CLARENCE. Ay, Madam, happily.

MARY.                              Happier he than I.

LADY MAGDALEN. It seems her Highness hath awaken'd. Think you
That I might dare to tell her that the Count--

MARY. I will see no man hence for evermore,
Saving my confessor and my cousin Pole.

LADY MAGDALEN. It is the Count de Feria, my dear lady.

MARY. What Count?

LADY MAGDALEN.    The Count de Feria, from his Majesty
King Philip.

MARY.        Philip! quick! loop up my hair!
Throw cushions on that seat, and make it throne-like.
Arrange my dress--the gorgeous Indian shawl
That Philip brought me in our happy days!--
That covers all. So--am I somewhat Queenlike,
Bride of the mightiest sovereign upon earth?

LADY CLARENCE. Ay, so your Grace would bide a moment yet.

MARY. No, no, he brings a letter. I may die
Before I read it. Let me see him at once.

    _Enter_ COUNT DE FERIA (_kneels_).

FERIA. I trust your Grace is well. (_Aside_) How her hand burns!

MARY. I am not well, but it will better me,
Sir Count, to read the letter which you bring.

FERIA. Madam, I bring no letter.

MARY.                            How! no letter?

FERIA. His Highness is so vex'd with strange affairs--

MARY. That his own wife is no affair of his.

FERIA. Nay, Madam, nay! he sends his veriest love,
And says, he will come quickly.

MARY.                           Doth he, indeed?
You, sir, do _you_ remember what _you_ said
When last you came to England?

FERIA.                         Madam, I brought
My King's congratulations; it was hoped
Your Highness was once more in happy state
To give him an heir male.

MARY.                     Sir, you said more;
You said he would come quickly. I had horses
On all the road from Dover, day and night;
On all the road from Harwich, night and day;
But the child came not, and the husband came not;
And yet he will come quickly.... Thou hast learnt
Thy lesson, and I mine. There is no need
For Philip so to shame himself again.
Return,
And tell him that I know he comes no more.
Tell him at last I know his love is dead,
And that I am in state to bring forth death--
Thou art commission'd to Elizabeth,
And not to me!

FERIA.         Mere compliments and wishes.
But shall I take some message from your Grace?

MARY. Tell her to come and close my dying eyes,
And wear my crown, and dance upon my grave.

FERIA. Then I may say your Grace will see your sister?
Your Grace is too low-spirited. Air and sunshine.
I would we had you, Madam, in our warm Spain.
You droop in your dim London.

MARY.                         Have him away!
I sicken of his readiness.

LADY CLARENCE.             My Lord Count,
Her Highness is too ill for colloquy.

FERIA (_kneels, and kisses her hand_).
I wish her Highness better. (_Aside_) How her hand burns!

                                                   [_Exeunt_.



SCENE III.--A HOUSE NEAR LONDON.

ELIZABETH, STEWARD OF THE HOUSEHOLD, ATTENDANTS.


ELIZABETH. There's half an angel wrong'd in your account;
Methinks I am all angel, that I bear it
Without more ruffling. Cast it o'er again.

STEWARD. I were whole devil if I wrong'd you, Madam.
                                           [_Exit_ STEWARD.

ATTENDANT. The Count de Feria, from the King of Spain.

ELIZABETH. Ay!--let him enter. Nay, you need not go:
    [_To her_ LADIES.
Remain within the chamber, but apart.
We'll have no private conference. Welcome to
England!

    _Enter_ FERIA.

FERIA.   Fair island star!

ELIZABETH.                 I shine! What else, Sir Count?

FERIA. As far as France, and into Philip's heart.
My King would know if you be fairly served,
And lodged, and treated.

ELIZABETH.               You see the lodging, sir,
I am well-served, and am in everything
Most loyal and most grateful to the Queen.

FERIA. You should be grateful to my master, too.
He spoke of this; and unto him you owe
That Mary hath acknowledged you her heir.

ELIZABETH. No, not to her nor him; but to the people,
Who know my right, and love me, as I love
The people! whom God aid!

FERIA.                    You will be Queen,
And, were I Philip--

ELIZABETH.          Wherefore pause you--what?

FERIA. Nay, but I speak from mine own self, not
him;
Your royal sister cannot last; your hand
Will be much coveted! What a delicate one!
Our Spanish ladies have none such--and there,
Were you in Spain, this fine fair gossamer gold--
Like sun-gilt breathings on a frosty dawn--
That hovers round your shoulder--

ELIZABETH.                       Is it so fine?
Troth, some have said so.

FERIA.                   --would be deemed a miracle.

ELIZABETH. Your Philip hath gold hair and golden beard;
There must be ladies many with hair like mine.

FERIA, Some few of Gothic blood have golden hair,
But none like yours.

ELIZABETH.           I am happy you approve it.

FERIA. But as to Philip and your Grace--consider,
If such a one as you should match with Spain,
What hinders but that Spain and England join'd,
Should make the mightiest empire earth has known.
Spain would be England on her seas, and England
Mistress of the Indies.

ELIZABETH.              It may chance, that England
Will be the Mistress of the Indies yet,
Without the help of Spain.

FERIA.                     Impossible;
Except you put Spain down.
Wide of the mark ev'n for a madman's dream.

ELIZABETH. Perhaps; but we have seamen.
Count de Feria,
I take it that the King hath spoken to you;
But is Don Carlos such a goodly match?

FERIA. Don Carlos, Madam, is but twelve years old.

ELIZABETH. Ay, tell the King that I will muse upon it;
He is my good friend, and I would keep him so;
But--he would have me Catholic of Rome,
And that I scarce can be; and, sir, till now
My sister's marriage, and my father's marriages,
Make me full fain to live and die a maid.
But I am much beholden to your King.
Have you aught else to tell me?

FERIA.                          Nothing, Madam,
Save that methought I gather'd from the Queen
That she would see your Grace before she--died.

ELIZABETH. God's death! and wherefore spake you not before?
We dally with our lazy moments here,
And hers are number'd. Horses there, without!
I am much beholden to the King, your master.
Why did you keep me prating? Horses, there!

                                   [_Exit_ ELIZABETH, _etc_.

FERIA. So from a clear sky falls the thunderbolt!
Don Carlos? Madam, if you marry Philip,
Then I and he will snaffle your 'God's death,'
And break your paces in, and make you tame;
God's death, forsooth--you do not know King Philip.

                                             [_Exit_.



SCENE IV.--LONDON. BEFORE THE PALACE.

_A light burning within_. VOICES _of the night passing_.


FIRST. Is not yon light in the Queen's chamber?

SECOND.                                         Ay,
They say she's dying.

FIRST.                So is Cardinal Pole.
May the great angels join their wings, and make
Down for their heads to heaven!

SECOND. Amen. Come on.
                          [_Exeunt_.

    TWO OTHERS.

FIRST. There's the Queen's light. I hear she cannot live.

SECOND. God curse her and her Legate! Gardiner burns
Already; but to pay them full in kind,
The hottest hold in all the devil's den
Were but a sort of winter; sir, in Guernsey,
I watch'd a woman burn; and in her agony
The mother came upon her--a child was born--
And, sir, they hurl'd it back into the fire,
That, being but baptized in fire, the babe
Might be in fire for ever. Ah, good neighbour,
There should be something fierier than fire
To yield them their deserts.

FIRST.                       Amen to all
Your wish, and further.

A THIRD VOICE. Deserts! Amen to what? Whose deserts? Yours? You have a
gold ring on your finger, and soft raiment about your body; and is not
the woman up yonder sleeping after all she has done, in peace and
quietness, on a soft bed, in a closed room, with light, fire, physic,
tendance; and I have seen the true men of Christ lying famine-dead by
scores, and under no ceiling but the cloud that wept on them, not for
them.

FIRST. Friend, tho' so late, it is not safe to preach.
You had best go home. What are you?

THIRD. What am I? One who cries continually with sweat and tears to
the Lord God that it would please Him out of His infinite love to
break down all kingship and queenship, all priesthood and prelacy; to
cancel and abolish all bonds of human allegiance, all the magistracy,
all the nobles, and all the wealthy; and to send us again, according
to His promise, the one King, the Christ, and all things in common, as
in the day of the first church, when Christ Jesus was King.

FIRST. If ever I heard a madman,--let's away!
Why, you long-winded--Sir, you go beyond me.
I pride myself on being moderate.
Good night! Go home. Besides, you curse so loud,
The watch will hear you. Get you home at once.

                                          [_Exeunt_.



SCENE V.--LONDON. A ROOM IN THE PALACE.

_A Gallery on one side. The moonlight streaming through a range of
windows on the wall opposite_. MARY, LADY CLARENCE, LADY MAGDALEN
DACRES, ALICE. QUEEN _pacing the Gallery. A writing table in front_.
QUEEN _comes to the table and writes and goes again, pacing the
Gallery_.


LADY CLARENCE. Mine eyes are dim: what hath she written? read.

ALICE. 'I am dying, Philip; come to me.'

LADY MAGDALEN. There--up and down, poor lady, up and down.

ALICE. And how her shadow crosses one by one
The moonlight casements pattern'd on the wall,
Following her like her sorrow. She turns again.

    [QUEEN _sits and writes, and goes again_.

LADY CLARENCE. What hath she written now?

ALICE. Nothing; but 'come, come, come,' and all awry,
And blotted by her tears. This cannot last.

    [QUEEN _returns_.

MARY. I whistle to the bird has broken cage,
And all in vain.    [_Sitting down_.
Calais gone--Guisnes gone, too--and Philip gone!

LADY CLARENCE. Dear Madam, Philip is but at the wars;
I cannot doubt but that he comes again;
And he is with you in a measure still.
I never look'd upon so fair a likeness
As your great King in armour there, his hand
Upon his helmet.
                    [_Pointing to the portrait of Philip on the wall_.

MARY.            Doth he not look noble?
I had heard of him in battle over seas,
And I would have my warrior all in arms.
He said it was not courtly to stand helmeted
Before the Queen. He had his gracious moment,
Altho' you'll not believe me. How he smiles
As if he loved me yet!

LADY CLARENCE.         And so he does.

MARY. He never loved me--nay, he could not love me.
It was his father's policy against France.
I am eleven years older than he,
Poor boy!    [_Weeps_.

ALICE. That was a lusty boy of twenty-seven;    [_Aside_.
Poor enough in God's grace!

MARY.                      --And all in vain!
The Queen of Scots is married to the Dauphin,
And Charles, the lord of this low world, is gone;
And all his wars and wisdoms past away:
And in a moment I shall follow him.

LADY CLARENCE. Nay, dearest Lady, see your good physician.

MARY. Drugs--but he knows they cannot help me--says
That rest is all--tells me I must not think--
That I must rest--I shall rest by and by.
Catch the wild cat, cage him, and when he springs
And maims himself against the bars, say 'rest':
Why, you must kill him if you would have him rest--
Dead or alive you cannot make him happy.

LADY CLARENCE. Your Majesty has lived so pure a life,
And done such mighty things by Holy Church,
I trust that God will make you happy yet.

MARY. What is the strange thing happiness? Sit down here:
Tell me thine happiest hour.

LADY CLARENCE.               I will, if that
May make your Grace forget yourself a little.
There runs a shallow brook across our field
For twenty miles, where the black crow flies five,
And doth so bound and babble all the way
As if itself were happy. It was May-time,
And I was walking with the man I loved.
I loved him, but I thought I was not loved.
And both were silent, letting the wild brook
Speak for us--till he stoop'd and gather'd one
From out a bed of thick forget-me-nots,
Look'd hard and sweet at me, and gave it me.
I took it, tho' I did not know I took it,
And put it in my bosom, and all at once
I felt his arms about me, and his lips--

MARY. O God! I have been too slack, too slack;
There are Hot Gospellers even among our guards--
Nobles we dared not touch. We have but burnt
The heretic priest, workmen, and women and children.
Wet, famine, ague, fever, storm, wreck, wrath,--
We have so play'd the coward; but by God's grace,
We'll follow Philip's leading, and set up
The Holy Office here--garner the wheat,
And burn the tares with unquenchable fire!
Burn!--
Fie, what a savour! tell the cooks to close
The doors of all the offices below.
Latimer!
Sir, we are private with our women here--
Ever a rough, blunt, and uncourtly fellow--
Thou light a torch that never will go out!
'Tis out--mine flames. Women, the Holy Father
Has ta'en the legateship from our cousin Pole--
Was that well done? and poor Pole pines of it,
As I do, to the death. I am but a woman,
I have no power.--Ah, weak and meek old man,
Seven-fold dishonour'd even in the sight
Of thine own sectaries--No, no. No pardon!
Why that was false: there is the right hand still
Beckons me hence.
Sir, you were burnt for heresy, not for treason,
Remember that! 'twas I and Bonner did it,
And Pole; we are three to one--Have you found mercy there,
Grant it me here: and see, he smiles and goes,
Gentle as in life.

ALICE.             Madam, who goes? King Philip?

MARY. No, Philip comes and goes, but never goes.
Women, when I am dead,
Open my heart, and there you will find written
Two names, Philip and Calais; open his,--
So that he have one,--
You will find Philip only, policy, policy,--
Ay, worse than that--not one hour true to me!
Foul maggots crawling in a fester'd vice!
Adulterous to the very heart of Hell.
Hast thou a knife?

ALICE.             Ay, Madam, but o' God's mercy--

MARY. Fool, think'st thou I would peril mine own soul
By slaughter of the body? I could not, girl,
Not this way--callous with a constant stripe,
Unwoundable. The knife!

ALICE.                  Take heed, take heed!
The blade is keen as death.

MARY.                       This Philip shall not
Stare in upon me in my haggardness;
Old, miserable, diseased,
Incapable of children. Come thou down.
              [_Cuts out the picture and throws it down_.
Lie there. (_Wails_) O God, I have kill'd my Philip!

ALICE.                                               No,
Madam, you have but cut the canvas out;
We can replace it.

MARY.              All is well then; rest--
I will to rest; he said, I must have rest.
                     [_Cries of_ 'ELIZABETH' _in the street_.
A cry! What's that? Elizabeth? revolt?
A new Northumberland, another Wyatt?
I'll fight it on the threshold of the grave.

LADY CLARENCE. Madam, your royal sister comes to see you.

MARY. I will not see her.
Who knows if Boleyn's daughter be my sister?
I will see none except the priest. Your arm.
                               [_To_ LADY CLARENCE.
O Saint of Aragon, with that sweet worn smile
Among thy patient wrinkles--Help me hence.
                                              [_Exeunt_.

    _The_ PRIEST _passes. Enter_ ELIZABETH _and_ SIR WILLIAM CECIL.

ELIZABETH. Good counsel yours--
                               No one in waiting? still,
As if the chamberlain were Death himself!
The room she sleeps in--is not this the way?
No, that way there are voices. Am I too late?
Cecil ... God guide me lest I lose the way.
                                  [_Exit_ ELIZABETH.

CECIL. Many points weather'd, many perilous ones,
At last a harbour opens; but therein
Sunk rocks--they need fine steering--much it is
To be nor mad, nor bigot--have a mind--
Nor let Priests' talk, or dream of worlds to be,
Miscolour things about her--sudden touches
For him, or him--sunk rocks; no passionate faith--
But--if let be--balance and compromise;
Brave, wary, sane to the heart of her--a Tudor
School'd by the shadow of death--a Boleyn, too,
Glancing across the Tudor--not so well.

    _Enter_ ALICE.

How is the good Queen now?

ALICE.                     Away from Philip.
Back in her childhood--prattling to her mother
Of her betrothal to the Emperor Charles,
And childlike--jealous of him again--and once
She thank'd her father sweetly for his book
Against that godless German. Ah, those days
Were happy. It was never merry world
In England, since the Bible came among us.

CECIL. And who says that?

ALICE. It is a saying among the Catholics.

CECIL. It never will be merry world in England,
Till all men have their Bible, rich and poor.

ALICE. The Queen is dying, or you dare not say it.

    _Enter_ ELIZABETH.

ELIZABETH. The Queen is dead.

CECIL. Then here she stands! my homage.

ELIZABETH. She knew me, and acknowledged me her heir,
Pray'd me to pay her debts, and keep the Faith:
Then claspt the cross, and pass'd away in peace.
I left her lying still and beautiful,
More beautiful than in life. Why would you vex yourself,
Poor sister? Sir, I swear I have no heart
To be your Queen. To reign is restless fence,
Tierce, quart, and trickery. Peace is with the dead.
Her life was winter, for her spring was nipt:
And she loved much: pray God she be forgiven.

CECIL. Peace with the dead, who never were at peace!
Yet she loved one so much--I needs must say--
That never English monarch dying left
England so little.

ELIZABETH. But with Cecil's aid
And others, if our person be secured
From traitor stabs--we will make England great.

    _Enter_ PAGET, _and other_ LORDS OF THE COUNCIL,
    SIR RALPH BAGENHALL, _etc_.

LORDS. God save Elizabeth, the Queen of England!

BAGENHALL. God save the Crown! the Papacy is no more.

PAGET (_aside_).
Are we so sure of that?

ACCLAMATION.            God save the Queen!


END OF QUEEN MARY.






HAROLD: A DRAMA.



TO HIS EXCELLENCY THE RIGHT HON. LORD LYTTON, VICEROY AND
GOVERNOR-GENERAL OF INDIA.

My Dear Lord Lytton,--After old-world records--such as the Bayeux
tapestry and the Roman de Rou,--Edward Freeman's History of the Norman
Conquest, and your father's Historical Romance treating of the same
times, have been mainly helpful to me in writing this Drama. Your
father dedicated his 'Harold' to my father's brother; allow me to
dedicate my 'Harold' to yourself.

A. TENNYSON.



SHOW-DAY AT BATTLE ABBEY, 1876.

A garden here--May breath and bloom of spring--
The cuckoo yonder from an English elm
Crying 'with my false egg I overwhelm
The native nest:' and fancy hears the ring
Of harness, and that deathful arrow sing,
And Saxon battleaxe clang on Norman helm.
Here rose the dragon-banner of our realm:
Here fought, here fell, our Norman-slander'd king.
O Garden blossoming out of English blood!
O strange hate-healer Time! We stroll and stare
Where might made right eight hundred years ago;
Might, right? ay good, so all things make for good--
But he and he, if soul be soul, are where
Each stands full face with all he did below.

ACT I.


SCENE I.--LONDON. THE KING'S PALACE.

    (_A comet seen through the open window_.)

ALDWYTH, GAMEL, COURTIERS _talking together_.


FIRST COURTIER. Lo! there once more--this is the seventh night!
Yon grimly-glaring, treble-brandish'd scourge Of England!

SECOND COURTIER. Horrible!

FIRST COURTIER.            Look you, there's a star
That dances in it as mad with agony!

THIRD COURTIER. Ay, like a spirit in Hell who skips and flies
To right and left, and cannot scape the flame.

SECOND COURTIER. Steam'd upward from the undescendable
Abysm.

FIRST COURTIER. Or floated downward from the throne
Of God Almighty.

ALDWYTH.         Gamel, son of Orm,
What thinkest thou this means?

GAMEL.                         War, my dear lady!

ALDWYTH. Doth this affright thee?

GAMEL.                            Mightily, my dear lady!

ALDWYTH. Stand by me then, and look upon my face,
Not on the comet.

    _Enter_ MORCAR.

                  Brother! why so pale?

MORCAR. It glares in heaven, it flares upon the Thames,
The people are as thick as bees below,
They hum like bees,--they cannot speak--for awe;
Look to the skies, then to the river, strike
Their hearts, and hold their babies up to it.
I think that they would Molochize them too,
To have the heavens clear.

ALDWYTH. They fright not me.

    _Enter_ LEOFWIN, _after him_ GURTH.

Ask thou Lord Leofwin what he thinks of this!

MORCAR. Lord Leofwin, dost thou believe, that these
Three rods of blood-red fire up yonder mean
The doom of England and the wrath of Heaven?

BISHOP OF LONDON (_passing_).
Did ye not cast with bestial violence
Our holy Norman bishops down from all
Their thrones in England? I alone remain.
Why should not Heaven be wroth?

LEOFWIN. With us, or thee?

BISHOP OF LONDON. Did ye not outlaw your archbishop Robert,
Robert of Jumieges--well-nigh murder him too?
Is there no reason for the wrath of Heaven?

LEOFWIN. Why then the wrath of Heaven hath three tails,
The devil only one.

                       [_Exit_ BISHOP OF LONDON.

    _Enter_ ARCHBISHOP STIGAND.

Ask _our_ Archbishop.
Stigand should know the purposes of Heaven.

STIGAND. Not I. I cannot read the face of heaven;
Perhaps our vines will grow the better for it.

LEOFWIN (_laughing_).
He can but read the king's face on his coins.

STIGAND. Ay, ay, young lord, _there_ the king's face is power.

GURTH. O father, mock not at a public fear,
But tell us, is this pendent hell in heaven
A harm to England?

STIGAND.           Ask it of King Edward!
And he may tell thee, _I_ am a harm to England.
Old uncanonical Stigand--ask of _me_
Who had my pallium from an Antipope!
Not he the man--for in our windy world
What's up is faith, what's down is heresy.
Our friends, the Normans, holp to shake his chair.
I have a Norman fever on me, son,
And cannot answer sanely.... What it means?
Ask our broad Earl.
                       [_Pointing to_ HAROLD, _who enters_.

HAROLD (_seeing_ GAMEL).
                    Hail, Gamel, son of Orm!
Albeit no rolling stone, my good friend Gamel,
Thou hast rounded since we met. Thy life at home
Is easier than mine here. Look! am I not
Work-wan, flesh-fallen?

GAMEL.                  Art thou sick, good Earl?

HAROLD. Sick as an autumn swallow for a voyage,
Sick for an idle week of hawk and hound
Beyond the seas--a change! When camest thou hither?

GAMEL. To-day, good Earl.

HAROLD.                   Is the North quiet, Gamel?

GAMEL. Nay, there be murmurs, for thy brother breaks us
With over-taxing--quiet, ay, as yet--
Nothing as yet.

HAROLD.         Stand by him, mine old friend,
Thou art a great voice in Northumberland!
Advise him: speak him sweetly, he will hear thee.
He is passionate but honest. Stand thou by him!
More talk of this to-morrow, if yon weird sign
Not blast us in our dreams.--Well, father Stigand--
                        [_To_ STIGAND, _who advances to him_.

STIGAND (_pointing to the comet_).
War there, my son? is that the doom of England?

HAROLD. Why not the doom of all the world as well?
For all the world sees it as well as England.
These meteors came and went before our day,
Not harming any: it threatens us no more
Than French or Norman. War? the worst that follows
Things that seem jerk'd out of the common rut
Of Nature is the hot religious fool,
Who, seeing war in heaven, for heaven's credit
Makes it on earth: but look, where Edward draws
A faint foot hither, leaning upon Tostig.
He hath learnt to love our Tostig much of late.

LEOFWIN. And _he_ hath learnt, despite the tiger in him,
To sleek and supple himself to the king's hand.

GURTH. I trust the kingly touch that cures the evil
May serve to charm the tiger out of him.

LEOFWIN. He hath as much of cat as tiger in him.
Our Tostig loves the hand and not the man.

HAROLD. Nay! Better die than lie!

    _Enter_ KING, QUEEN, _and_ TOSTIG.

EDWARD. In heaven signs!
Signs upon earth! signs everywhere! your Priests
Gross, worldly, simoniacal, unlearn'd!
They scarce can read their Psalter; and your churches
Uncouth, unhandsome, while in Normanland
God speaks thro' abler voices, as He dwells
In statelier shrines. I say not this, as being
Half Norman-blooded, nor as some have held,
Because I love the Norman better--no,
But dreading God's revenge upon this realm
For narrowness and coldness: and I say it
For the last time perchance, before I go
To find the sweet refreshment of the Saints.
I have lived a life of utter purity:
I have builded the great church of Holy Peter:
I have wrought miracles--to God the glory--
And miracles will in my name be wrought
Hereafter.--I have fought the fight and go--
I see the flashing of the gates of pearl--
And it is well with me, tho' some of you
Have scorn'd me--ay--but after I am gone
Woe, woe to England! I have had a vision;
The seven sleepers in the cave at Ephesus
Have turn'd from right to left.

HAROLD.                         My most dear Master,
What matters? let them turn from left to right
And sleep again.

TOSTIG.          Too hardy with thy king!
A life of prayer and fasting well may see
Deeper into the mysteries of heaven
Than thou, good brother.

ALDWYTH (_aside_).       Sees he into thine,
That thou wouldst have his promise for the crown?

EDWARD. Tostig says true; my son, thou art too hard,
Not stagger'd by this ominous earth and heaven:
But heaven and earth are threads of the same loom,
Play into one another, and weave the web
That may confound thee yet.

HAROLD.                     Nay, I trust not,
For I have served thee long and honestly.

EDWARD. I know it, son; I am not thankless: thou
Hast broken all my foes, lighten'd for me
The weight of this poor crown, and left me time
And peace for prayer to gain a better one.
Twelve years of service! England loves thee for it.
Thou art the man to rule her!

ALDWYTH (_aside_).            So, not Tostig!

HAROLD. And after those twelve years a boon, my king,
Respite, a holiday: thyself wast wont
To love the chase: thy leave to set my feet
On board, and hunt and hawk beyond the seas!

EDWARD. What, with this flaming horror overhead?

HAROLD. Well, when it passes then.

EDWARD.                            Ay if it pass.
Go not to Normandy--go not to Normandy.

HAROLD. And wherefore not, my king, to Normandy?
Is not my brother Wulfnoth hostage there
For my dead father's loyalty to thee?
I pray thee, let me hence and bring him home.

EDWARD. Not thee, my son: some other messenger.

HAROLD. And why not me, my lord, to Normandy?
Is not the Norman Count thy friend and mine?

EDWARD. I pray thee, do not go to Normandy.

HAROLD. Because my father drove the Normans out
Of England?--That was many a summer gone--
Forgotten and forgiven by them and thee.

EDWARD. Harold, I will not yield thee leave to go.

HAROLD. Why then to Flanders. I will hawk and hunt
In Flanders.

EDWARD.      Be there not fair woods and fields
In England? Wilful, wilful. Go--the Saints
Pilot and prosper all thy wandering out
And homeward. Tostig, I am faint again.
Son Harold, I will in and pray for thee.

    [_Exit, leaning on_ TOSTIG, _and followed by_
    STIGAND, MORCAR, _and_ COURTIERS.

HAROLD. What lies upon the mind of our good king
That he should harp this way on Normandy?

QUEEN. Brother, the king is wiser than he seems;
And Tostig knows it; Tostig loves the king.

HAROLD. And love should know; and--be the
king so wise,--
Then Tostig too were wiser than he seems.
I love the man but not his phantasies.

    _Re-enter_ TOSTIG.

Well, brother,
When didst thou hear from thy Northumbria?

TOSTIG. When did I hear aught but this '_When_' from thee?
Leave me alone, brother, with my Northumbria:
She is _my_ mistress, let _me_ look to her!
The King hath made me Earl; make me not fool!
Nor make the King a fool, who made me Earl!

HAROLD. No, Tostig--lest I make myself a fool
Who made the King who made thee, make thee Earl.

TOSTIG. Why chafe me then? Thou knowest I soon go wild.

GURTH. Come, come! as yet thou art not gone so wild
But thou canst hear the best and wisest of us.

HAROLD. So says old Gurth, not I: yet hear! thine earldom,
Tostig, hath been a kingdom. Their old crown
Is yet a force among them, a sun set
But leaving light enough for Alfgar's house
To strike thee down by--nay, this ghastly glare
May heat their fancies.

TOSTIG.                 My most worthy brother,
Thou art the quietest man in all the world--
Ay, ay and wise in peace and great in war--
Pray God the people choose thee for their king!
But all the powers of the house of Godwin
Are not enframed in thee.

HAROLD.                   Thank the Saints, no!
But thou hast drain'd them shallow by thy tolls,
And thou art ever here about the King:
Thine absence well may seem a want of care.
Cling to their love; for, now the sons of Godwin
Sit topmost in the field of England, envy,
Like the rough bear beneath the tree, good brother,
Waits till the man let go.

TOSTIG.                    Good counsel truly!
I heard from my Northumbria yesterday.

HAROLD. How goes it then with thy Northumbria?
Well?

TOSTIG. And wouldst thou that it went aught else than well?

HAROLD. I would it went as well as with mine earldom,
Leofwin's and Gurth's.

TOSTIG.                Ye govern milder men.

GURTH. We have made them milder by just government.

TOSTIG. Ay, ever give yourselves your own good word.

LEOFWIN. An honest gift, by all the Saints, if giver

And taker be but honest! but they bribe
Each other, and so often, an honest world
Will not believe them.

HAROLD.                I may tell thee, Tostig,
I heard from thy Northumberland to-day.

TOSTIG. From spies of thine to spy my nakedness
In my poor North!

HAROLD.           There is a movement there,
A blind one--nothing yet.

TOSTIG.                   Crush it at once
With all the power I have!--I must--I will!--
Crush it half-born! Fool still? or wisdom there,
My wise head-shaking Harold?

HAROLD.                       Make not thou
The nothing something. Wisdom when in power
And wisest, should not frown as Power, but smile
As kindness, watching all, till the true _must_
Shall make her strike as Power: but when to strike--
O Tostig, O dear brother--If they prance,
Rein in, not lash them, lest they rear and run
And break both neck and axle.

TOSTIG.                       Good again!
Good counsel tho' scarce needed. Pour not water
In the full vessel running out at top
To swamp the house.

LEOFWIN.            Nor thou be a wild thing
Out of the waste, to turn and bite the hand
Would help thee from the trap.

TOSTIG.                        Thou playest in tune.

LEOFWIN. To the deaf adder thee, that wilt not dance
However wisely charm'd.

TOSTIG.                 No more, no more!

GURTH. I likewise cry 'no more.' Unwholesome talk
For Godwin's house! Leofwin, thou hast a tongue!
Tostig, thou look'st as thou wouldst spring upon him.
St. Olaf, not while I am by! Come, come,
Join hands, let brethren dwell in unity;
Let kith and kin stand close as our shield-wall,
Who breaks us then? I say, thou hast a tongue,
And Tostig is not stout enough to bear it.
Vex him not, Leofwin.

TOSTIG.               No, I am not vext,--
Altho' ye seek to vex me, one and all.
I have to make report of my good earldom
To the good king who gave it--not to you--
Not any of you.--I am not vext at all.

HAROLD. The king? the king is ever at his prayers;
In all that handles matter of the state
I am the king.

TOSTIG.        That shall thou never be
If I can thwart thee.

HAROLD.               Brother, brother!

TOSTIG.                                 Away!

                 [_Exit_ TOSTIG.

QUEEN. Spite of this grisly star ye three must gall
Poor Tostig.

LEOFWIN.     Tostig, sister, galls himself;
He cannot smell a rose but pricks his nose
Against the thorn, and rails against the rose.

QUEEN. I am the only rose of all the stock
That never thorn'd him; Edward loves him, so
Ye hate him. Harold always hated him.
Why--how they fought when boys--and, Holy Mary!
How Harold used to beat him!

HAROLD.                      Why, boys will fight.
Leofwin would often fight me, and I beat him.
Even old Gurth would fight. I had much ado
To hold mine own against old Gurth. Old Gurth,
We fought like great states for grave cause; but
Tostig--
On a sudden--at a something--for a nothing--
The boy would fist me hard, and when we fought
I conquer'd, and he loved me none the less,
Till thou wouldst get him all apart, and tell him
That where he was but worsted, he was wrong'd.
Ah! thou hast taught the king to spoil him too;
Now the spoilt child sways both. Take heed, take heed;
Thou art the Queen; ye are boy and girl no more:
Side not with Tostig in any violence,
Lest thou be sideways guilty of the violence.

QUEEN. Come fall not foul on me. I leave thee, brother.

HAROLD. Nay, my good sister--

    [_Exeunt_ QUEEN, HAROLD, GURTH, _and_ LEOFWIN.

ALDWYTH.                     Gamel, son of Orm,
What thinkest thou this means?    [_Pointing to the comet_.

GAMEL.                         War, my dear lady,
War, waste, plague, famine, all malignities.

ALDWYTH. It means the fall of Tostig from his earldom.

GAMEL. That were too small a matter for a comet!

ALDWYTH. It means the lifting of the house of Alfgar.

GAMEL. Too small! a comet would not show for that!

ALDWYTH. Not small for thee, if thou canst compass it.

GAMEL. Thy love?

ALDWYTH. As much as I can give thee, man;
This Tostig is, or like to be, a tyrant;
Stir up thy people: oust him!

GAMEL.                        And thy love?

ALDWYTH. As much as thou canst bear.

GAMEL.                               I can bear all,
And not be giddy.

ALDWYTH.          No more now: to-morrow.



SCENE II.--IN THE GARDEN. THE KING'S HOUSE NEAR LONDON. SUNSET.


EDITH. Mad for thy mate, passionate nightingale....
I love thee for it--ay, but stay a moment;
_He_ can but stay a moment: he is going.
I fain would hear him coming!... near me ... near.
Somewhere--To draw him nearer with a charm
Like thine to thine.
                        (_Singing_.)

    Love is come with a song and a smile,
    Welcome Love with a smile and a song:
    Love can stay but a little while.
    Why cannot he stay? They call him away:
    Ye do him wrong, ye do him wrong;
    Love will stay for a whole life long.

        _Enter_ HAROLD.

HAROLD. The nightingales in Havering-at-the-Bower
Sang out their loves so loud, that Edward's prayers
Were deafen'd and he pray'd them dumb, and thus
I dumb thee too, my wingless nightingale!
                                    [_Kissing her_.

EDITH. Thou art my music! Would their wings were mine
To follow thee to Flanders! Must thou go?

HAROLD. Not must, but will. It is but for one moon.

EDITH. Leaving so many foes in Edward's hall
To league against thy weal. The Lady Aldwyth
Was here to-day, and when she touch'd on thee,
She stammer'd in her hate; I am sure she hates thee,
Pants for thy blood.

HAROLD.              Well, I have given her cause--
I fear no woman.

EDITH.                Hate not one who felt
Some pity for thy hater! I am sure
Her morning wanted sunlight, she so praised
The convent and lone life--within the pale--
Beyond the passion. Nay--she held with Edward,
At least methought she held with holy Edward,
That marriage was half sin.

HAROLD.                     A lesson worth
Finger and thumb--thus (_snaps his fingers_). And my answer to it--
See here--an interwoven H and E!
Take thou this ring; I will demand his ward
From Edward when I come again. Ay, would she?
She to shut up my blossom in the dark!
Thou art _my_ nun, thy cloister in mine arms.

EDITH (_taking the ring_).
Yea, but Earl Tostig--

HAROLD.               That's a truer fear!
For if the North take fire, I should be back;
I shall be, soon enough.

EDITH.                   Ay, but last night
An evil dream that ever came and went--

HAROLD. A gnat that vext thy pillow! Had I been by,
I would have spoil'd his horn. My girl, what was it?

EDITH. Oh! that thou wert not going!
For so methought it was our marriage-morn,
And while we stood together, a dead man
Rose from behind the altar, tore away
My marriage ring, and rent my bridal veil;
And then I turn'd, and saw the church all fill'd
With dead men upright from their graves, and all
The dead men made at thee to murder thee,
But thou didst back thyself against a pillar,
And strike among them with thy battle-axe--
There, what a dream!

HAROLD.              Well, well--a dream--no more!

EDITH. Did not Heaven speak to men in dreams of old?

HAROLD. Ay--well--of old. I tell thee what, my child;
Thou hast misread this merry dream of thine,
Taken the rifted pillars of the wood
For smooth stone columns of the sanctuary,
The shadows of a hundred fat dead deer
For dead men's ghosts. True, that the battle-axe
Was out of place; it should have been the bow.--
Come, thou shalt dream no more such dreams; I swear it,
By mine own eyes--and these two sapphires--these
Twin rubies, that are amulets against all
The kisses of all kind of womankind
In Flanders, till the sea shall roll me back
To tumble at thy feet.

EDITH.                 That would but shame me,
Rather than make me vain. The sea may roll
Sand, shingle, shore-weed, not the living rock
Which guards the land.

HAROLD.                Except it be a soft one,
And undereaten to the fall. Mine amulet ...
This last ... upon thine eyelids, to shut in
A happier dream. Sleep, sleep, and thou shalt see
My grayhounds fleeting like a beam of light,
And hear my peregrine and her bells in heaven;
And other bells on earth, which yet are heaven's;
Guess what they be.

EDITH.              He cannot guess who knows.
Farewell, my king.

HAROLD.            Not yet, but then--my queen.
                               [_Exeunt_.
    _Enter_ ALDWYTH _from the thicket_.

ALDWYTH. The kiss that charms thine eyelids into sleep,
Will hold mine waking. Hate him? I could love him
More, tenfold, than this fearful child can do;
Griffyth I hated: why not hate the foe
Of England? Griffyth when I saw him flee,
Chased deer-like up his mountains, all the blood
That should have only pulsed for Griffyth, beat
For his pursuer. I love him or think I love him.
If he were King of England, I his queen,
I might be sure of it. Nay, I do love him.--
She must be cloister'd somehow, lest the king
Should yield his ward to Harold's will. What harm?
She hath but blood enough to live, not love.--
When Harold goes and Tostig, shall I play
The craftier Tostig with him? fawn upon him?
Chime in with all? 'O thou more saint than king!'
And that were true enough. 'O blessed relics!'
'O Holy Peter!' If he found me thus,
Harold might hate me; he is broad and honest,
Breathing an easy gladness ... not like Aldwyth ...
For which I strangely love him. Should not England
Love Aldwyth, if she stay the feuds that part
The sons of Godwin from the sons of Alfgar
By such a marrying? Courage, noble Aldwyth!
Let all thy people bless thee!
                               Our wild Tostig,
Edward hath made him Earl: he would be king:--
The dog that snapt the shadow, dropt the bone.--
I trust he may do well, this Gamel, whom
I play upon, that he may play the note
Whereat the dog shall howl and run, and Harold
Hear the king's music, all alone with him,
Pronounced his heir of England.
I see the goal and half the way to it.--
Peace-lover is our Harold for the sake
Of England's wholeness--so--to shake the North
With earthquake and disruption--some division--
Then fling mine own fair person in the gap
A sacrifice to Harold, a peace-offering,
A scape-goat marriage--all the sins of both
The houses on mine head--then a fair life
And bless the Queen of England.

MORCAR (_coming from the thicket_).
                                Art thou assured
By this, that Harold loves but Edith?

ALDWYTH.                              Morcar!
Why creep'st thou like a timorous beast of prey
Out of the bush by night?

MORCAR.                   I follow'd thee.

ALDWYTH. Follow my lead, and I will make thee earl.

MORCAR. What lead then?

ALDWYTH.                Thou shalt flash it secretly
Among the good Northumbrian folk, that I--
That Harold loves me--yea, and presently
That I and Harold are betroth'd--and last--
Perchance that Harold wrongs me; tho' I would not
That it should come to that.

MORCAR.                      I will both flash
And thunder for thee.

ALDWYTH.              I said 'secretly;'
It is the flash that murders, the poor thunder
Never harm'd head.

MORCAR.            But thunder may bring down
That which the flash hath stricken.

ALDWYTH.                            Down with Tostig!
That first of all--And when doth Harold go?

MORCAR. To-morrow--first to Bosham, then to Flanders.

ALDWYTH. Not to come back till Tostig shall have shown
And redden'd with his people's blood the teeth
That shall be broken by us--yea, and thou
Chair'd in his place. Good-night, and dream thyself
Their chosen Earl.
                      [_Exit_ ALDWYTH.

MORCAR.            Earl first, and after that
Who knows I may not dream myself their king!




ACT II.


SCENE I.--SEASHORE. PONTHIEU. NIGHT.

HAROLD _and his_ MEN, _wrecked_.


HAROLD. Friends, in that last inhospitable plunge
Our boat hath burst her ribs; but ours are whole;
I have but bark'd my hands.

ATTENDANT.                  I dug mine into
My old fast friend the shore, and clinging thus
Felt the remorseless outdraught of the deep
Haul like a great strong fellow at my legs,
And then I rose and ran. The blast that came
So suddenly hath fallen as suddenly--
Put thou the comet and this blast together--

HAROLD. Put thou thyself and mother-wit together.
Be not a fool!

    _Enter_ FISHERMEN _with torches_, HAROLD _going
    up to one of them_, ROLF.

               Wicked sea-will-o'-the-wisp!
Wolf of the shore! dog, with thy lying lights
Thou hast betray'd us on these rocks of thine!

ROLF. Ay, but thou liest as loud as the black herring-pond behind
thee. We be fishermen; I came to see after my nets.

HAROLD. To drag us into them. Fishermen? devils!
Who, while ye fish for men with your false fires,
Let the great Devil fish for your own souls.

ROLF. Nay then, we be liker the blessed Apostles; _they_ were fishers
of men, Father Jean says.

HAROLD. I had liefer that the fish had swallowed me,
Like Jonah, than have known there were such devils.
What's to be done?
                      [_To his_ MEN--_goes apart with them_.

FISHERMAN. Rolf, what fish did swallow Jonah?

ROLF. A whale!

FISHERMAN. Then a whale to a whelk we have swallowed the King of
England. I saw him over there. Look thee, Rolf, when I was down in the
fever, _she_ was down with the hunger, and thou didst stand by her and
give her thy crabs, and set her up again, till now, by the patient
Saints, she's as crabb'd as ever.

ROLF. And I'll give her my crabs again, when thou art down again.

FISHERMAN. I thank thee, Rolf. Run thou to Count Guy; he is hard at
hand. Tell him what hath crept into our creel, and he will fee thee as
freely as he will wrench this outlander's ransom out of him--and why
not? for what right had he to get himself wrecked on another man's
land?

ROLF. Thou art the human-heartedest, Christian-charitiest of all
crab-catchers. Share and share alike!
                                         [_Exit_.

HAROLD (_to_ FISHERMAN).
Fellow, dost thou catch crabs?

FISHERMAN. As few as I may in a wind, and less than I would in a calm.
Ay!

HAROLD. I have a mind that thou shalt catch no more.

FISHERMAN. How?

HAROLD. I have a mind to brain thee with mine axe.

FISHERMAN. Ay, do, do, and our great Count-crab will make his nippers
meet in thine heart; he'll sweat it out of thee, he'll sweat it out of
thee. Look, he's here! He'll speak for himself! Hold thine own, if
thou canst!

    _Enter_ GUY, COUNT OF PONTHIEU.

HAROLD. Guy, Count of Ponthieu?

GUY.                            Harold, Earl of Wessex!

HAROLD. Thy villains with their lying lights have wreck'd us!

GUY. Art thou not Earl of Wessex?

HAROLD.                           In mine earldom
A man may hang gold bracelets on a bush,
And leave them for a year, and coming back
Find them again.

GUY.             Thou art a mighty man
In thine own earldom!

HAROLD.               Were such murderous liars
In Wessex--if I caught them, they should hang
Cliff-gibbeted for sea-marks; our sea-mew
Winging their only wail!

GUY.                     Ay, but my men
Hold that the shipwreckt are accursed of God;--
What hinders me to hold with mine own men?

HAROLD. The Christian manhood of the man who reigns!

GUY. Ay, rave thy worst, but in our oubliettes
Thou shalt or rot or ransom. Hale him hence!
    [_To one of his_ ATTENDANTS.
Fly thou to William; tell him we have Harold.



SCENE II.--BAYEUX. PALACE.

COUNT WILLIAM _and_ WILLIAM MALET.


WILLIAM. We hold our Saxon woodcock in the springe,
But he begins to flutter. As I think
He was thine host in England when I went
To visit Edward.

MALET.           Yea, and there, my lord,
To make allowance for their rougher fashions,
I found him all a noble host should be.

WILLIAM. Thou art his friend: thou know'st my claim on England
Thro' Edward's promise: we have him in the toils.
And it were well, if thou shouldst let him feel,
How dense a fold of danger nets him round,
So that he bristle himself against my will.

MALET. What would I do, my lord, if I were you?

WILLIAM. What wouldst thou do?

MALET.                         My lord, he is thy guest.

WILLIAM. Nay, by the splendour of God, no guest of mine.
He came not to see me, had past me by
To hunt and hawk elsewhere, save for the fate
Which hunted _him_ when that un-Saxon blast,
And bolts of thunder moulded in high heaven
To serve the Norman purpose, drave and crack'd
His boat on Ponthieu beach; where our friend Guy
Had wrung his ransom from him by the rack,
But that I slept between and purchased him,
Translating his captivity from Guy
To mine own hearth at Bayeux, where he sits
My ransom'd prisoner.

MALET.                Well, if not with gold,
With golden deeds and iron strokes that brought
Thy war with Brittany to a goodlier close
Than else had been, he paid his ransom back.

WILLIAM. So that henceforth they are not like to league
With Harold against _me_.

MALET.                    A marvel, how
He from the liquid sands of Coesnon
Haled thy shore-swallow'd, armour'd Normans up
To fight for thee again!

WILLIAM.                 Perchance against
Their saver, save thou save him from himself.

MALET. But I should let him home again, my lord.

WILLIAM. Simple! let fly the bird within the hand,
To catch the bird again within the bush!
No.
Smooth thou my way, before he clash with me;
I want his voice in England for the crown,
I want thy voice with him to bring him round;
And being brave he must be subtly cow'd,
And being truthful wrought upon to swear
Vows that he dare not break. England our own
Thro' Harold's help, he shall be my dear friend
As well as thine, and thou thyself shalt have
Large lordship there of lands and territory.

MALET. I knew thy purpose; he and Wulfnoth never
Have met, except in public; shall they meet
In private? I have often talk'd with Wulfnoth,
And stuff'd the boy with fears that these may act
On Harold when they meet.

WILLIAM.                  Then let them meet!

MALET. I can but love this noble, honest Harold.

WILLIAM. Love him! why not? thine is a loving office,
I have commission'd thee to save the man:
Help the good ship, showing the sunken rock,
Or he is wreckt for ever.

    _Enter_ WILLIAM RUFUS.

WILLIAM RUFUS.            Father.

WILLIAM.                          Well, boy.

WILLIAM RUFUS. They have taken away the toy thou gavest me,
The Norman knight.

WILLIAM.           Why, boy?

WILLIAM RUFUS.                Because I broke
The horse's leg--it was mine own to break;
I like to have my toys, and break them too.

WILLIAM. Well, thou shalt have another Norman knight!

WILLIAM RUFUS. And may I break his legs?

WILLIAM.                                 Yea,--get thee gone!

WILLIAM RUFUS. I'll tell them I have had my way with thee.
                                                      [_Exit_.

MALET. I never knew thee check thy will for ought
Save for the prattling of thy little ones.

WILLIAM. Who shall be kings of England. I am heir
Of England by the promise of her king.

MALET. But there the great Assembly choose their king,
The choice of England is the voice of England.

WILLIAM. I will be king of England by the laws,
The choice, and voice of England.

MALET.                            Can that be?

WILLIAM. The voice of any people is the sword
That guards them, or the sword that beats them down.
Here comes the would-be what I will be ... king-like ...
Tho' scarce at ease; for, save our meshes break,
More kinglike he than like to prove a king.

    _Enter_ HAROLD, _musing, with his eyes on the ground_.

He sees me not--and yet he dreams of me.
Earl, wilt thou fly my falcons this fair day?
They are of the best, strong-wing'd against the wind.

HAROLD (_looking up suddenly, having caught but the last word_).
_Which_ way does it blow?

WILLIAM.                  Blowing for England, ha?
Not yet. Thou hast not learnt thy quarters here.
The winds so cross and jostle among these towers.

HAROLD. Count of the Normans, thou hast ransom'd us,
Maintain'd, and entertain'd us royally!

WILLIAM. And thou for us hast fought as loyally,
Which binds us friendship-fast for ever!

HAROLD.                                  Good!
But lest we turn the scale of courtesy
By too much pressure on it, I would fain,
Since thou hast promised Wulfnoth home with us,
Be home again with Wulfnoth.

WILLIAM. Stay--as yet
Thou hast but seen how Norman hands can strike,
But walk'd our Norman field, scarce touch'd or tasted
The splendours of our Court.

HAROLD.                      I am in no mood:
I should be as the shadow of a cloud
Crossing your light.

WILLIAM.             Nay, rest a week or two,
And we will fill thee full of Norman sun,
And send thee back among thine island mists
With laughter.

HAROLD.        Count, I thank thee, but had rather
Breathe the free wind from off our Saxon downs,
Tho' charged with all the wet of all the west.

WILLIAM. Why if thou wilt, so let it be--thou shalt.
That were a graceless hospitality
To chain the free guest to the banquet-board;
To-morrow we will ride with thee to Harfleur,
And see thee shipt, and pray in thy behalf
For happier homeward winds than that which crack'd
Thy bark at Ponthieu,--yet to us, in faith,
A happy one--whereby we came to know
Thy valour and thy value, noble earl.
Ay, and perchance a happy one for thee,
Provided--I will go with thee to-morrow--
Nay--but there be conditions, easy ones,
So thou, fair friend, will take them easily.

    _Enter_ PAGE.

PAGE. My lord, there is a post from over seas
With news for thee.    [_Exit_ PAGE.

WILLIAM. Come, Malet, let us hear!

                   [_Exeunt_ COUNT WILLIAM _and_ MALET.

HAROLD. Conditions? What conditions? pay him back
His ransom? 'easy '--that were easy--nay--
No money-lover he! What said the King?
'I pray you do not go to Normandy.'
And fate hath blown me hither, bound me too
With bitter obligation to the Count--
Have I not fought it out? What did he mean?
There lodged a gleaming grimness in his eyes,
Gave his shorn smile the lie. The walls oppress me,
And yon huge keep that hinders half the heaven.
Free air! free field!
               [_Moves to go out. A_ MAN-AT-ARMS _follows him_.

HAROLD (_to the_ MAN-AT-ARMS).
I need thee not. Why dost thou follow me?

MAN-AT-ARMS. I have the Count's commands to follow thee.

HAROLD. What then? Am I in danger in this court?

MAN-AT-ARMS. I cannot tell. I have the Count's commands.

HAROLD. Stand out of earshot then, and keep me still
In eyeshot.

MAN-AT-ARMS. Yea, lord Harold.    [_Withdraws_.

HAROLD.                        And arm'd men
Ever keep watch beside my chamber door,
And if I walk within the lonely wood,
There is an arm'd man ever glides behind!

    _Enter_ MALET.

Why am I follow'd, haunted, harass'd, watch'd?
See yonder!    [_Pointing to the_ MAN-AT-ARMS.

MALET.      'Tis the good Count's care for thee!
The Normans love thee not, nor thou the Normans,
Or--so they deem.

HAROLD.           But wherefore is the wind,
Which way soever the vane-arrow swing,
Not ever fair for England? Why but now
He said (thou heardst him) that I must not hence
Save on conditions.

MALET.              So in truth he said.

HAROLD. Malet, thy mother was an Englishwoman;
There somewhere beats an English pulse in thee!

MALET. Well--for my mother's sake I love your England,
But for my father I love Normandy.

HAROLD. Speak for thy mother's sake, and tell me true.

MALET. Then for my mother's sake, and England's sake
That suffers in the daily want of thee,
Obey the Count's conditions, my good friend.

HAROLD. How, Malet, if they be not honourable!

MALET. Seem to obey them.

HAROLD.                   Better die than lie!

MALET. Choose therefore whether thou wilt have thy conscience
White as a maiden's hand, or whether England
Be shatter'd into fragments.

HAROLD.                      News from England?

MALET. Morcar and Edwin have stirr'd up the Thanes
Against thy brother Tostig's governance;
And all the North of Humber is one storm.

HAROLD. I should be there, Malet, I should be there!

MALET. And Tostig in his own hall on suspicion
Hath massacred the Thane that was his guest,
Gamel, the son of Orm: and there be more
As villainously slain.

HAROLD.                The wolf! the beast!
Ill news for guests, ha, Malet! More? What more?
What do they say? did Edward know of this?

MALET. They say, his wife was knowing and abetting.

HAROLD. They say, his wife!--To marry and have no husband
Makes the wife fool. My God, I should be there.
I'll hack my way to the sea.

MALET.                       Thou canst not, Harold;
Our Duke is all between thee and the sea,
Our Duke is all about thee like a God;
All passes block'd. Obey him, speak him fair,
For he is only debonair to those
That follow where he leads, but stark as death
To those that cross him.--Look thou, here is Wulfnoth!
I leave thee to thy talk with him alone;
How wan, poor lad! how sick and sad for home!
                                         [_Exit_ MALET.

HAROLD (_muttering_).
Go not to Normandy--go not to Normandy!

    _Enter_ WULFNOTH.

Poor brother! still a hostage!

WULFNOTH.                      Yea, and I
Shall see the dewy kiss of dawn no more
Make blush the maiden-white of our tall cliffs,
Nor mark the sea-bird rouse himself and hover
Above the windy ripple, and fill the sky
With free sea-laughter--never--save indeed
Thou canst make yield this iron-mooded Duke
To let me go.

HAROLD.       Why, brother, so he will;
But on conditions. Canst thou guess at them?

WULFNOTH. Draw nearer,--I was in the corridor,
I saw him coming with his brother Odo
The Bayeux bishop, and I hid myself.

HAROLD. They did thee wrong who made thee hostage; thou
Wast ever fearful.

WULFNOTH.          And he spoke--I heard him--
'This Harold is not of the royal blood,
Can have no right to the crown,' and Odo said,
'Thine is the right, for thine the might; he is here,
And yonder is thy keep.'

HAROLD.                  No, Wulfnoth, no.

WULFNOTH. And William laugh'd and swore that might was right,
Far as he knew in this poor world of ours--
'Marry, the Saints must go 'along with us,
And, brother, we will find a way,' said he--
Yea, yea, he would be king of England.

HAROLD. Never!

WULFNOTH.      Yea, but thou must not this way answer _him_.

HAROLD. Is it not better still to speak the truth?

WULFNOTH. Not here, or thou wilt never hence nor I:
For in the racing toward this golden goal
He turns not right or left, but tramples flat
Whatever thwarts him; hast thou never heard
His savagery at Alencon,--the town
Hung out raw hides along their walls, and cried
'Work for the tanner.'

HAROLD.                That had anger'd _me_
Had I been William.

WULFNOTH.           Nay, but he had prisoners,
He tore their eyes out, sliced their hands away,
And flung them streaming o'er the battlements
Upon the heads of those who walk'd within--
O speak him fair, Harold, for thine own sake.

HAROLD. Your Welshman says, 'The Truth against the World,'
Much more the truth against myself.

WULFNOTH.                           Thyself?
But for my sake, oh brother! oh! for my sake!

HAROLD. Poor Wulfnoth! do they not entreat thee well?

WULFNOTH. I see the blackness of my dungeon loom
Across their lamps of revel, and beyond
The merriest murmurs of their banquet clank
The shackles that will bind me to the wall.

HAROLD. Too fearful still!

WULFNOTH. Oh no, no--speak him fair!
Call it to temporize; and not to lie;
Harold, I do not counsel thee to lie.
The man that hath to foil a murderous aim
May, surely, play with words.

HAROLD. Words are the man.
Not ev'n for thy sake, brother, would I lie.

WULFNOTH. Then for thine Edith?

HAROLD. There thou prick'st me deep.

WULFNOTH. And for our Mother England?

HAROLD. Deeper still.

WULFNOTH. And deeper still the deep-down oubliette,
Down thirty feet below the smiling day--
In blackness--dogs' food thrown upon thy head.
And over thee the suns arise and set,
And the lark sings, the sweet stars come and go,
And men are at their markets, in their fields,
And woo their loves and have forgotten thee;
And thou art upright in thy living grave,
Where there is barely room to shift thy side,
And all thine England hath forgotten thee;
And he our lazy-pious Norman King,
With all his Normans round him once again,
Counts his old beads, and hath forgotten thee.

HAROLD. Thou art of my blood, and so methinks, my boy,
Thy fears infect me beyond reason. Peace!

WULFNOTH. And then our fiery Tostig, while thy hands
Are palsied here, if his Northumbrians rise
And hurl him from them,--I have heard the Normans
Count upon this confusion--may he not make
A league with William, so to bring him back?

HAROLD. That lies within the shadow of the chance.

WULFNOTH. And like a river in flood thro' a burst dam
Descends the ruthless Norman--our good King
Kneels mumbling some old bone--our helpless folk
Are wash'd away, wailing, in their own blood--

HAROLD. Wailing! not warring? Boy, thou hast forgotten
That thou art English.

WULFNOTH.              Then our modest women--
I know the Norman license--thine own Edith--

HAROLD. No more! I will not hear thee--William comes.

WULFNOTH. I dare not well be seen in talk with thee.
Make thou not mention that I spake with thee.
                        [_Moves away to the back of the stage_.

    _Enter_ WILLIAM, MALET, _and_ OFFICER.

OFFICER. We have the man that rail'd against thy birth.

WILLIAM. Tear out his tongue.

OFFICER. He shall not rail again.
He said that he should see confusion fall
On thee and on thine house.

WILLIAM. Tear out his eyes, And plunge him into prison.

OFFICER. It shall be done.
                              [_Exit_ OFFICER.

WILLIAM. Look not amazed, fair earl! Better leave undone
Than do by halves--tongueless and eyeless, prison'd--

HAROLD. Better methinks have slain the man at once!

WILLIAM. We have respect for man's immortal soul,
We seldom take man's life, except in war;
It frights the traitor more to maim and blind.

HAROLD. In mine own land I should have scorn'd the man,
Or lash'd his rascal back, and let him go.

WILLIAM. And let him go? To slander thee again!
Yet in thine own land in thy father's day
They blinded my young kinsman, Alfred--ay,
Some said it was thy father's deed.

HAROLD. They lied.

WILLIAM. But thou and he--whom at thy word, for thou
Art known a speaker of the truth, I free
From this foul charge--

HAROLD. Nay, nay, he freed himself
By oath and compurgation from the charge.
The king, the lords, the people clear'd him of it.

WILLIAM. But thou and he drove our good Normans out
From England, and this rankles in us yet.
Archbishop Robert hardly scaped with life.

HAROLD. Archbishop Robert! Robert the Archbishop!
Robert of Jumieges, he that--

MALET.                       Quiet! quiet!

HAROLD. Count! if there sat within the Norman chair
A ruler all for England--one who fill'd
All offices, all bishopricks with English--
We could not move from Dover to the Humber
Saving thro' Norman bishopricks--I say
Ye would applaud that Norman who should drive
The stranger to the fiends!

WILLIAM. Why, that is reason!
Warrior thou art, and mighty wise withal!
Ay, ay, but many among our Norman lords
Hate thee for this, and press upon me--saying
God and the sea have given thee to our hands--
To plunge thee into life-long prison here:--
Yet I hold out against them, as I may,
Yea--would hold out, yea, tho' they should revolt--
For thou hast done the battle in my cause;
I am thy fastest friend in Normandy.

HAROLD. I am doubly bound to thee ... if this be so.

WILLIAM. And I would bind thee more, and would myself
Be bounden to thee more.

HAROLD. Then let me hence With Wulfnoth to King Edward.

WILLIAM. So we will. We hear he hath not long to live.

HAROLD. It may be.

WILLIAM. Why then the heir of England, who is he?

HAROLD. The Atheling is nearest to the throne.

WILLIAM. But sickly, slight, half-witted and a child,
Will England have him king?

HAROLD.                     It may be, no.

WILLIAM. And hath King Edward not pronounced his heir?

HAROLD. Not that I know.

WILLIAM. When he was here in Normandy,
He loved us and we him, because we found him.
A Norman of the Normans.

HAROLD.                  So did we.

WILLIAM. A gentle, gracious, pure and saintly man!
And grateful to the hand that shielded him,
He promised that if ever he were king
In England, he would give his kingly voice
To me as his successor. Knowest thou this?

HAROLD. I learn it now.

WILLIAM.                Thou knowest I am his cousin,
And that my wife descends from Alfred?

HAROLD.                                Ay.

WILLIAM. Who hath a better claim then to the crown
So that ye will not crown the Atheling?

HAROLD. None that I know ... if that but hung upon
King Edward's will.

WILLIAM. Wilt thou uphold my claim?

MALET (_aside to_ HAROLD).
Be careful of thine answer, my good friend.

WULFNOTH (_aside to_ HAROLD).
Oh! Harold, for my sake and for thine own!

HAROLD. Ay ... if the king have not revoked his promise.

WILLIAM. But hath he done it then?

HAROLD. Not that I know.

WILLIAM. Good, good, and thou wilt help me to the crown?

HAROLD. Ay ... if the Witan will consent to this.

WILLIAM. Thou art the mightiest voice in England, man,
Thy voice will lead the Witan--shall I have it?

WULFNOTH (_aside to_ HAROLD).
Oh! Harold, if thou love thine Edith, ay.

HAROLD. Ay, if--

MALET (_aside to_ HAROLD).
Thine 'ifs' will sear thine eyes out--ay.

WILLIAM. I ask thee, wilt thou help me to the crown?
And I will make thee my great Earl of Earls,
Foremost in England and in Normandy;
Thou shalt be verily king--all but the name--
For I shall most sojourn in Normandy;
And thou be my vice-king in England. Speak.

WULFNOTH (_aside to_ HAROLD).
Ay, brother--for the sake of England--ay.

HAROLD. My lord--

MALET (_aside to_ HAROLD).
                 Take heed now.

HAROLD.                         Ay.

WILLIAM.                            I am content,
For thou art truthful, and thy word thy bond.
To-morrow will we ride with thee to Harfleur.
                                      [_Exit_ WILLIAM.

MALET. Harold, I am thy friend, one life with thee,
And even as I should bless thee saving mine,
I thank thee now for having saved thyself.
                                      [_Exit_ MALET.

HAROLD. For having lost myself to save myself,
Said 'ay' when I meant 'no,' lied like a lad
That dreads the pendent scourge, said 'ay' for 'no'!
Ay! No!--he hath not bound me by an oath--
Is 'ay' an oath? is 'ay' strong as an oath?
Or is it the same sin to break my word
As break mine oath? He call'd my word my bond!
He is a liar who knows I am a liar,
And makes believe that he believes my word--
The crime be on his head--not bounden--no.

    [_Suddenly doors are flung open, discovering in an
    inner hall_ COUNT WILLIAM _in his state robes,
    seated upon his throne, between two_ BISHOPS,
    ODO OP BAYEUX _being one: in the centre of
    the hall an ark covered with cloth of gold;
    and on either side of it the_ NORMAN BARONS.

    _Enter a_ JAILOR _before_ WILLIAM'S _throne_.

WILLIAM (_to_ JAILOR).
Knave, hast thou let thy prisoner scape?

JAILOR.                                  Sir Count,
He had but one foot, he must have hopt away,
Yea, some familiar spirit must have help'd him.

WILLIAM. Woe knave to thy familiar and to thee!
Give me thy keys.    [_They fall clashing_.
Nay let them lie. Stand there and wait my will.

                           [_The_ JAILOR _stands aside_.

WILLIAM (_to_ HAROLD).
Hast thou such trustless jailors in thy North?

HAROLD. We have few prisoners in mine earldom there,
So less chance for false keepers.

WILLIAM.                          We have heard
Of thy just, mild, and equal governance;
Honour to thee! thou art perfect in all honour!
Thy naked word thy bond! confirm it now
Before our gather'd Norman baronage,
For they will not believe thee--as I believe.
        [_Descends from his throne and stands by the ark_.
Let all men here bear witness of our bond!
        [_Beckons to_ HAROLD, _who advances_.

    _Enter_ MALET _behind him_.

Lay thou thy hand upon this golden pall!
Behold the jewel of St. Pancratius
Woven into the gold. Swear thou on this!

HAROLD. What should I swear? Why should I swear on this?

WILLIAM (_savagely_).
Swear thou to help me to the crown of England.

MALET (_whispering_ HAROLD).
My friend, thou hast gone too far to palter now.

WULFNOTH (_whispering_ HAROLD).
Swear thou to-day, to-morrow is thine own.

HAROLD. I swear to help thee to the crown of England ...
According as King Edward promises.

WILLIAM. Thou must swear absolutely, noble Earl.

MALET (_whispering_).
Delay is death to thee, ruin to England.

WULFNOTH (_whispering_).
Swear, dearest brother, I beseech thee, swear!

HAROLD (_putting his hand on the jewel_).
I swear to help thee to the crown of England.

WILLIAM. Thanks, truthful Earl; I did not doubt thy word,
But that my barons might believe thy word,
And that the Holy Saints of Normandy
When thou art home in England, with thine own,
Might strengthen thee in keeping of thy word,
I made thee swear.--Show him by whom he hath sworn.

    [_The two_ BISHOPS _advance, and raise the cloth of gold.
    The bodies and bones of Saints are seen lying in the ark_.

The holy bones of all the Canonised
From all the holiest shrines in Normandy!

HAROLD. Horrible!    [_They let the cloth fall again_.

WILLIAM. Ay, for thou hast sworn an oath
Which, if not kept, would make the hard earth rive
To the very Devil's horns, the bright sky cleave
To the very feet of God, and send her hosts
Of injured Saints to scatter sparks of plague
Thro' all your cities, blast your infants, dash
The torch of war among your standing corn,
Dabble your hearths with your own blood.--Enough!
Thou wilt not break it! I, the Count--the King--
Thy friend--am grateful for thine honest oath,
Not coming fiercely like a conqueror, now,
But softly as a bridegroom to his own.
For I shall rule according to your laws,
And make your ever-jarring Earldoms move
To music and in order--Angle, Jute,
Dane, Saxon, Norman, help to build a throne
Out-towering hers of France.... The wind is fair
For England now.... To-night we will be merry.
To-morrow will I ride with thee to Harfleur.

       [_Exeunt_ WILLIAM _and all the_ NORMAN BARONS, _etc_.

HAROLD. To-night we will be merry--and to-morrow--
Juggler and bastard--bastard--he hates that most--
William the tanner's bastard! Would he heard me!
O God, that I were in some wide, waste field
With nothing but my battle-axe and him
To spatter his brains! Why let earth rive, gulf in
These cursed Normans--yea and mine own self.
Cleave heaven, and send thy saints that I may say
Ev'n to their faces, 'If ye side with William
Ye are not noble.' How their pointed fingers
Glared at me! Am I Harold, Harold, son
Of our great Godwin? Lo! I touch mine arms,
My limbs--they are not mine--they are a liar's--
I mean to be a liar--I am not bound--
Stigand shall give me absolution for it--
Did the chest move? did it move? I am utter craven!
O Wulfnoth, Wulfnoth, brother, thou hast betray'd me!

WULFNOTH. Forgive me, brother, I will live here and die.

    _Enter_ PAGE.

PAGE. My lord! the Duke awaits thee at the banquet.

HAROLD. Where they eat dead men's flesh, and drink their blood.

PAGE. My lord--

HAROLD.        I know your Norman cookery is so spiced,
It masks all this.

PAGE.              My lord! thou art white as death.

HAROLD. With looking on the dead. Am I so white?
Thy Duke will seem the darker. Hence, I follow.

                                         [_Exeunt_.




ACT III.


SCENE I.--THE KING'S PALACE. LONDON.

KING EDWARD _dying on a couch, and by him standing the_ QUEEN, HAROLD,
ARCHBISHOP STIGAND, GURTH, LEOFWIN, ARCHBISHOP ALDRED, ALDWYTH, _and_
EDITH.


STIGAND. Sleeping or dying there? If this be death,
Then our great Council wait to crown thee King--
Come hither, I have a power;    [_To_ HAROLD.
They call me near, for I am close to thee
And England--I, old shrivell'd Stigand, I,
Dry as an old wood-fungus on a dead tree,
I have a power!
See here this little key about my neck!
There lies a treasure buried down in Ely:
If e'er the Norman grow too hard for thee,
Ask me for this at thy most need, son Harold,
At thy most need--not sooner.

HAROLD.                       So I will.

STIGAND. Red gold--a hundred purses--yea, and more!
If thou canst make a wholesome use of these
To chink against the Norman, I do believe
My old crook'd spine would bud out two young wings
To fly to heaven straight with.

HAROLD.                         Thank thee, father!
Thou art English, Edward too is English now,
He hath clean repented of his Normanism.

STIGAND. Ay, as the libertine repents who cannot
Make done undone, when thro' his dying sense
Shrills 'lost thro' thee.' They have built their castles here;
Our priories are Norman; the Norman adder
Hath bitten us; we are poison'd: our dear England
Is demi-Norman. He!--
                  [_Pointing to_ KING EDWARD, _sleeping_.

HAROLD.              I would I were
As holy and as passionless as he!
That I might rest as calmly! Look at him--
The rosy face, and long down-silvering beard,
The brows unwrinkled as a summer mere.--

STIGAND. A summer mere with sudden wreckful gusts
From a side-gorge. Passionless? How he flamed
When Tostig's anger'd earldom flung him, nay,
He fain had calcined all Northumbria
To one black ash, but that thy patriot passion
Siding with our great Council against Tostig,
Out-passion'd his! Holy? ay, ay, forsooth,
A conscience for his own soul, not his realm;
A twilight conscience lighted thro' a chink;
Thine by the sun; nay, by some sun to be,
When all the world hath learnt to speak the truth,
And lying were self-murder by that state
Which was the exception.

HAROLD.                  That sun may God speed!

STIGAND. Come, Harold, shake the cloud off!

HAROLD.                                     Can I, father?
Our Tostig parted cursing me and England;
Our sister hates us for his banishment;
He hath gone to kindle Norway against England,
And Wulfnoth is alone in Normandy.
For when I rode with William down to Harfleur,
'Wulfnoth is sick,' he said; 'he cannot follow;'
Then with that friendly-fiendly smile of his,
'We have learnt to love him, let him a little longer
Remain a hostage for the loyalty
Of Godwin's house.' As far as touches Wulfnoth
I that so prized plain word and naked truth
Have sinn'd against it--all in vain.

LEOFWIN.                             Good brother,
By all the truths that ever priest hath preach'd,
Of all the lies that ever men have lied,
Thine is the pardonablest.

HAROLD.                    May be so!
I think it so, I think I am a fool
To think it can be otherwise than so.

STIGAND. Tut, tut, I have absolved thee: dost thou scorn me,
Because I had my Canterbury pallium,
From one whom they dispoped?

HAROLD.                      No, Stigand, no!

STIGAND. Is naked truth actable in true life?
I have heard a saying of thy father Godwin,
That, were a man of state nakedly true,
Men would but take him for the craftier liar.

LEOFWIN. Be men less delicate than the Devil himself?
I thought that naked Truth would shame the Devil,
The Devil is so modest.

GURTH.                  He never said it!

LEOFWIN. Be thou not stupid-honest, brother Gurth!

HAROLD. Better to be a liar's dog, and hold
My master honest, than believe that lying
And ruling men are fatal twins that cannot
Move one without the other. Edward wakes!--
Dazed--he hath seen a vision.

EDWARD.                       The green tree!
Then a great Angel past along the highest
Crying 'the doom of England,' and at once
He stood beside me, in his grasp a sword
Of lightnings, wherewithal he cleft the tree
From off the bearing trunk, and hurl'd it from him
Three fields away, and then he dash'd and drench'd,
He dyed, he soak'd the trunk with human blood,
And brought the sunder'd tree again, and set it
Straight on the trunk, that thus baptized in blood
Grew ever high and higher, beyond my seeing,
And shot out sidelong boughs across the deep
That dropt themselves, and rooted in far isles
Beyond my seeing: and the great Angel rose
And past again along the highest crying
'The doom of England!'--Tostig, raise my head!
                                  [_Falls back senseless_.

HAROLD (_raising him_).
Let Harold serve for Tostig!

_QUEEN_.                     Harold served
Tostig so ill, he cannot serve for Tostig!
Ay, raise his head, for thou hast laid it low!
The sickness of our saintly king, for whom
My prayers go up as fast as my tears fall,
I well believe, hath mainly drawn itself
From lack of Tostig--thou hast banish'd him.

HAROLD. Nay--but the council, and the king himself.

QUEEN. Thou hatest him, hatest him.

HAROLD (_coldly_).
                                    Ay--Stigand, unriddle
This vision, canst thou?

STIGAND.                 Dotage!

EDWARD (_starting up_).
                                 It is finish'd.
I have built the Lord a house--the Lord hath dwelt
In darkness. I have built the Lord a house--
Palms, flowers, pomegranates, golden cherubim
With twenty-cubit wings from wall to wall--
I have built the Lord a house--sing, Asaph! clash
The cymbal, Heman! blow the trumpet, priest!
Fall, cloud, and fill the house--lo! my two pillars,
Jachin and Boaz!--    [_Seeing_ HAROLD _and_ GURTH.
Harold, Gurth,--where am I?
Where is the charter of our Westminster?

STIGAND. It lies beside thee, king, upon thy bed.

EDWARD. Sign, sign at once--take, sign it, Stigand, Aldred!
Sign it, my good son Harold, Gurth, and Leofwin,
Sign it, my queen!

ALL.               We have sign'd it.

EDWARD.                               It is finish'd!
The kingliest Abbey in all Christian lands,
The lordliest, loftiest minster ever built
To Holy Peter in our English isle!
Let me be buried there, and all our kings,
And all our just and wise and holy men
That shall be born hereafter. It is finish'd!
Hast thou had absolution for thine oath?    [_To_ HAROLD.

HAROLD. Stigand hath given me absolution for it.

EDWARD. Stigand is not canonical enough
To save thee from the wrath of Norman Saints.

STIGAND. Norman enough! Be there no Saints of England
To help us from their brethren yonder?

EDWARD.                                Prelate,
The Saints are one, but those of Normanland
Are mightier than our own. Ask it of Aldred.
                                       [_To_ HAROLD.

ALDRED. It shall be granted him, my king; for he
Who vows a vow to strangle his own mother
Is guiltier keeping this, than breaking it.

EDWARD. O friends, I shall not overlive the day.

STIGAND. Why then the throne is empty. Who inherits?
For tho' we be not bound by the king's voice
In making of a king, yet the king's voice
Is much toward his making. Who inherits?
Edgar the Atheling?

EDWARD.             No, no, but Harold.
I love him: he hath served me: none but he
Can rule all England. Yet the curse is on him
For swearing falsely by those blessed bones;
He did not mean to keep his vow.

HAROLD.                          Not mean
To make our England Norman.

EDWARD.                     There spake Godwin,
Who hated all the Normans; but their Saints
Have heard thee, Harold.

EDITH.                   Oh! my lord, my king!
He knew not whom he sware by.

EDWARD.                       Yea, I know
He knew not, but those heavenly ears have heard,
Their curse is on him; wilt thou bring another,
Edith, upon his head?

EDITH.                No, no, not I.

EDWARD. Why then, thou must not wed him.

HAROLD.                                  Wherefore, wherefore?

EDWARD. O son, when thou didst tell me of thine oath,
I sorrow'd for my random promise given
To yon fox-lion. I did not dream then
I should be king.--My son, the Saints are virgins;
They love the white rose of virginity,
The cold, white lily blowing in her cell:
I have been myself a virgin; and I sware
To consecrate my virgin here to heaven--
The silent, cloister'd, solitary life,
A life of life-long prayer against the curse
That lies on thee and England.

HAROLD.                        No, no, no.

EDWARD. Treble denial of the tongue of flesh,
Like Peter's when he fell, and thou wilt have
To wail for it like Peter. O my son!
Are all oaths to be broken then, all promises
Made in our agony for help from heaven?
Son, there is one who loves thee: and a wife,
What matters who, so she be serviceable
In all obedience, as mine own hath been:
God bless thee, wedded daughter.
                  [_Laying his hand on the_ QUEEN'S _head_.

QUEEN.                           Bless thou too
That brother whom I love beyond the rest,
My banish'd Tostig.

EDWARD.             All the sweet Saints bless him!
Spare and forbear him, Harold, if he comes!
And let him pass unscathed; he loves me, Harold!
Be kindly to the Normans left among us,
Who follow'd me for love! and dear son, swear
When thou art king, to see my solemn vow
Accomplish'd.

HAROLD.       Nay, dear lord, for I have sworn
Not to swear falsely twice.

EDWARD.                     Thou wilt not swear?

HAROLD. I cannot.

EDWARD.           Then on thee remains the curse,
Harold, if thou embrace her: and on thee,
Edith, if thou abide it,--

    [_The_ KING _swoons;_ EDITH _falls and kneels by the couch_.

STIGAND.                  He hath swoon'd!
Death?... no, as yet a breath.

HAROLD.                        Look up! look up!
Edith!

ALDRED. Confuse her not; she hath begun
Her life-long prayer for thee.

ALDWYTH.                       O noble Harold,
I would thou couldst have sworn.

HAROLD.                          For thine own pleasure?

ALDWYTH. No, but to please our dying king, and those
Who make thy good their own--all England, Earl.

ALDRED. _I_ would thou couldst have sworn. Our holy king
Hath given his virgin lamb to Holy Church
To save thee from the curse.

HAROLD.                      Alas! poor man,
_His_ promise brought it on me.

ALDRED.                         O good son!
That knowledge made him all the carefuller
To find a means whereby the curse might glance
From thee and England.

HAROLD.                Father, we so loved--

ALDRED. The more the love, the mightier is the prayer;
The more the love, the more acceptable
The sacrifice of both your loves to heaven.
No sacrifice to heaven, no help from heaven;
That runs thro' all the faiths of all the world.
And sacrifice there must be, for the king
Is holy, and hath talk'd with God, and seen
A shadowing horror; there are signs in heaven--

HAROLD. Your comet came and went.

ALDRED. And signs on earth!
Knowest thou Senlac hill?

HAROLD. I know all Sussex;
A good entrenchment for a perilous hour!

ALDRED. Pray God that come not suddenly! There is one
Who passing by that hill three nights ago--
He shook so that he scarce could out with it--
Heard, heard--

HAROLD.       The wind in his hair?

ALDRED.                             A ghostly horn
Blowing continually, and faint battle-hymns,
And cries, and clashes, and the groans of men;
And dreadful shadows strove upon the hill,
And dreadful lights crept up from out the marsh--
Corpse-candles gliding over nameless graves--

HAROLD. At Senlac?

ALDRED.            Senlac.

EDWARD (_waking_).
                           Senlac! Sanguelac,
The Lake of Blood!

STIGAND.           This lightning before death
Plays on the word,--and Normanizes too!

HAROLD. Hush, father, hush!

EDWARD.                     Thou uncanonical fool,
Wilt _thou_ play with the thunder? North and South
Thunder together, showers of blood are blown
Before a never-ending blast, and hiss
Against the blaze they cannot quench--a lake,
A sea of blood--we are drown'd in blood--for God
Has fill'd the quiver, and Death has drawn the bow--
Sanguelac! Sanguelac! the arrow! the arrow!    [_Dies_.

STIGAND. It is the arrow of death in his own heart--
And our great Council wait to crown thee King.



SCENE II.--IN THE GARDEN. THE KING'S HOUSE NEAR LONDON.


EDITH. Crown'd, crown'd and lost, crown'd King--and lost to me!

           (_Singing_.)

    Two young lovers in winter weather,
      None to guide them,
    Walk'd at night on the misty heather;
    Night, as black as a raven's feather;
    Both were lost and found together,
      None beside them.

That is the burthen of it--lost and found
Together in the cruel river Swale
A hundred years ago; and there's another,

      Lost, lost, the light of day,

To which the lover answers lovingly

      'I am beside thee.'
    Lost, lost, we have lost the way.
      'Love, I will guide thee.'
    Whither, O whither? into the river,
    Where we two may be lost together,
    And lost for ever? 'Oh! never, oh! never,
    Tho' we be lost and be found together.'

Some think they loved within the pale forbidden
By Holy Church: but who shall say? the truth
Was lost in that fierce North, where _they_ were lost,
Where all good things are lost, where Tostig lost
The good hearts of his people. It is Harold!

    _Enter_ HAROLD.

Harold the King!

HAROLD.          Call me not King, but Harold.

EDITH. Nay, thou art King!

HAROLD.                    Thine, thine, or King or churl!
My girl, thou hast been weeping: turn not thou
Thy face away, but rather let me be
King of the moment to thee, and command
That kiss my due when subject, which will make
My kingship kinglier to me than to reign
King of the world without it.

EDITH.                        Ask me not,
Lest I should yield it, and the second curse
Descend upon thine head, and thou be only
King of the moment over England.

HAROLD.                          Edith,
Tho' somewhat less a king to my true self
Than ere they crown'd me one, for I have lost
Somewhat of upright stature thro' mine oath,
Yet thee I would not lose, and sell not thou
Our living passion for a dead man's dream;
Stigand believed he knew not what he spake.
Oh God! I cannot help it, but at times
They seem to me too narrow, all the faiths
Of this grown world of ours, whose baby eye
Saw them sufficient. Fool and wise, I fear
This curse, and scorn it. But a little light!--
And on it falls the shadow of the priest;
Heaven yield us more! for better, Woden, all
Our cancell'd warrior-gods, our grim Walhalla,
Eternal war, than that the Saints at peace
The Holiest of our Holiest one should be
This William's fellow-tricksters;--better die
Than credit this, for death is death, or else
Lifts us beyond the lie. Kiss me--thou art not
A holy sister yet, my girl, to fear
There might be more than brother in my kiss,
And more than sister in thine own.

EDITH.                             I dare not.

HAROLD. Scared by the church--'Love for a whole life long'
When was that sung?

EDITH.              Here to the nightingales.

HAROLD. Their anthems of no church, how sweet they are!
Nor kingly priest, nor priestly king to cross
Their billings ere they nest.

EDITH.                        They are but of spring,
They fly the winter change--not so with us--
No wings to come and go.

HAROLD.                  But wing'd souls flying
Beyond all change and in the eternal distance
To settle on the Truth.

EDITH.                  They are not so true,
They change their mates.

HAROLD.                  Do they? I did not know it.

EDITH. They say thou art to wed the Lady Aldwyth.

HAROLD. They say, they say.

EDITH.                      If this be politic,
And well for thee and England--and for her--
Care not for me who love thee.

GURTH (_calling_).             Harold, Harold!

HAROLD. The voice of Gurth! (_Enter_ GURTH.)
                            Good even, my good brother!

GURTH. Good even, gentle Edith.

EDITH.                          Good even, Gurth.

GURTH. Ill news hath come! Our hapless brother, Tostig--
He, and the giant King of Norway, Harold
Hardrada--Scotland, Ireland, Iceland, Orkney,
Are landed North of Humber, and in a field
So packt with carnage that the dykes and brooks
Were bridged and damm'd with dead, have overthrown
Morcar and Edwin.

HAROLD.           Well then, we must fight.
How blows the wind?

GURTH.              Against St. Valery
And William.

HAROLD.      Well then, we will to the North.

GURTH. Ay, but worse news: this William sent to Rome,
Swearing thou swarest falsely by his Saints:
The Pope and that Archdeacon Hildebrand
His master, heard him, and have sent him back
A holy gonfanon, and a blessed hair
Of Peter, and all France, all Burgundy,
Poitou, all Christendom is raised against thee;
He hath cursed thee, and all those who fight for thee,
And given thy realm of England to the bastard.

HAROLD. Ha! ha!

EDITH. Oh! laugh not!... Strange and ghastly in the gloom
And shadowing of this double thunder-cloud
That lours on England--laughter!

HAROLD. No, not strange!
This was old human laughter in old Rome
Before a Pope was born, when that which reign'd
Call'd itself God.--A kindly rendering
Of 'Render unto Caesar.' ... The Good Shepherd!
Take this, and render that.

GURTH.                      They have taken York.

HAROLD. The Lord was God and came as man--the Pope
Is man and comes as God.--York taken?

GURTH.                                Yea,
Tostig hath taken York!

HAROLD.                 To York then. Edith,
Hadst thou been braver, I had better braved
All--but I love thee and thou me--and that
Remains beyond all chances and all churches,
And that thou knowest.

EDITH.                 Ay, but take back thy ring.
It burns my hand--a curse to thee and me.
I dare not wear it.
            [_Proffers_ HAROLD _the ring, which he takes_.

HAROLD.             But I dare. God with thee!

                          [_Exeunt_ HAROLD _and_ GURTH.

EDITH. The King hath cursed him, if he marry me;
The Pope hath cursed him, marry me or no!
God help me! I know nothing--can but pray
For Harold--pray, pray, pray--no help but prayer,
A breath that fleets beyond this iron world,
And touches Him that made it.




ACT IV.


SCENE I.--IN NORTHUMBRIA.

ARCHBISHOP ALDRED, MORCAR, EDWIN, _and_ FORCES. _Enter_ HAROLD.
_The standard of the golden Dragon of Wessex preceding him_.


HAROLD. What! are thy people sullen from defeat?
Our Wessex dragon flies beyond the Humber,
No voice to greet it.

EDWIN.                Let not our great king
Believe us sullen--only shamed to the quick
Before the king--as having been so bruised
By Harold, king of Norway; but our help
Is Harold, king of England. Pardon us, thou!
Our silence is our reverence for the king!

HAROLD. Earl of the Mercians! if the truth be gall,
Cram me not thou with honey, when our good hive
Needs every sting to save it.

VOICES.                       Aldwyth! Aldwyth!

HAROLD. Why cry thy people on thy sister's name?

MORCAR. She hath won upon our people thro' her beauty,
And pleasantness among them.

VOICES. Aldwyth, Aldwyth!

HAROLD. They shout as they would have her for a queen.

MORCAR. She hath followed with our host, and suffer'd all.

HAROLD. What would ye, men?

VOICE. Our old Northumbrian crown,
And kings of our own choosing.

HAROLD.                        Your old crown
Were little help without our Saxon carles
Against Hardrada.

VOICE.            Little! we are Danes,
Who conquer'd what we walk on, our own field.

HAROLD. They have been plotting here!    [_Aside_.

VOICE.                                He calls us little!

HAROLD. The kingdoms of this world began with little,
A hill, a fort, a city--that reach'd a hand
Down to the field beneath it, 'Be thou mine,
Then to the next, 'Thou also!' If the field
Cried out 'I am mine own;' another hill
Or fort, or city, took it, and the first
Fell, and the next became an Empire.

VOICE.                               Yet
Thou art but a West Saxon: _we_ are Danes!

HAROLD. My mother is a Dane, and I am English;
There is a pleasant fable in old books,
Ye take a stick, and break it; bind a score
All in one faggot, snap it over knee,
Ye cannot.

VOICE.     Hear King Harold! he says true!

HAROLD. Would ye be Norsemen?

VOICES.                       No!

HAROLD.                           Or Norman?

VOICES.                                      No!

HAROLD. Snap not the faggot-band then.

VOICE.                                 That is true!

VOICE. Ay, but thou art not kingly, only grandson
To Wulfnoth, a poor cow-herd.

HAROLD.                       This old Wulfnoth
Would take me on his knees and tell me tales
Of Alfred and of Athelstan the Great
Who drove you Danes; and yet he held that Dane,
Jute, Angle, Saxon, were or should be all
One England, for this cow-herd, like my father,
Who shook the Norman scoundrels off the throne,
Had in him kingly thoughts--a king of men,
Not made but born, like the great king of all,
A light among the oxen.

VOICE.                  That is true!

VOICE. Ay, and I love him now, for mine own father
Was great, and cobbled.

VOICE.                  Thou art Tostig's brother,
Who wastes the land.

HAROLD.              This brother comes to save
Your land from waste; I saved it once before,
For when your people banish'd Tostig hence,
And Edward would have sent a host against you,
Then I, who loved my brother, bad the king
Who doted on him, sanction your decree
Of Tostig's banishment, and choice of Morcar,
To help the realm from scattering.

VOICE.                             King! thy brother,
If one may dare to speak the truth, was wrong'd.
Wild was he, born so: but the plots against him
Had madden'd tamer men.

MORCAR.                 Thou art one of those
Who brake into Lord Tostig's treasure-house
And slew two hundred of his following,
And now, when Tostig hath come back with power,
Are frighted back to Tostig.

OLD THANE.                   Ugh! Plots and feuds!
This is my ninetieth birthday. Can ye not
Be brethren? Godwin still at feud with Alfgar,
And Alfgar hates King Harold. Plots and feuds!
This is my ninetieth birthday!

HAROLD.                        Old man, Harold
Hates nothing; not _his_ fault, if our two houses
Be less than brothers.

VOICES.                Aldwyth, Harold, Aldwyth!

HAROLD. Again! Morcar! Edwin! What do they mean?

EDWIN. So the good king would deign to lend an ear
Not overscornful, we might chance--perchance--
To guess their meaning.

MORCAR.                 Thine own meaning, Harold,
To make all England one, to close all feuds,
Mixing our bloods, that thence a king may rise
Half-Godwin and half-Alfgar, one to rule
All England beyond question, beyond quarrel.

HAROLD. Who sow'd this fancy here among the people?

MORCAR. Who knows what sows itself among the people?
A goodly flower at times.

HAROLD.                   The Queen of Wales?
Why, Morcar, it is all but duty in her
To hate me; I have heard she hates me.

MORCAR.                                No!
For I can swear to that, but cannot swear
That these will follow thee against the Norsemen,
If thou deny them this.

HAROLD.                 Morcar and Edwin,
When will you cease to plot against my house?

EDWIN. The king can scarcely dream that we, who know
His prowess in the mountains of the West,
Should care to plot against him in the North.

MORCAR. Who dares arraign us, king, of such a plot?

HAROLD. Ye heard one witness even now.

MORCAR.                                The craven!
There is a faction risen again for Tostig,
Since Tostig came with Norway--fright not love.

HAROLD. Morcar and Edwin, will ye, if I yield,
Follow against the Norseman?

MORCAR.                      Surely, surely!

HAROLD. Morcar and Edwin, will ye upon oath,
Help us against the Norman?

MORCAR.                     With good will;
Yea, take the Sacrament upon it, king.

HAROLD. Where is thy sister?

MORCAR.                      Somewhere hard at hand.
Call and she comes.

    [_One goes out, then enter_ ALDWYTH.

HAROLD.             I doubt not but thou knowest
Why thou art summon'd.

ALDWYTH.               Why?--I stay with these,
Lest thy fierce Tostig spy me out alone,
And flay me all alive.

HAROLD.                Canst thou love one
Who did discrown thine husband, unqueen thee?
Didst thou not love thine husband?

ALDWYTH.                           Oh! my lord,
The nimble, wild, red, wiry, savage king--
That was, my lord, a match of policy.

HAROLD.                               Was it?
I knew him brave: he loved his land: he fain
Had made her great: his finger on her harp
(I heard him more than once) had in it Wales,
Her floods, her woods, her hills: had I been his,
I had been all Welsh.

ALDWYTH.              Oh, ay--all Welsh--and yet
I saw thee drive him up his hills--and women
Cling to the conquer'd, if they love, the more;
If not, they cannot hate the conqueror.
We never--oh! good Morcar, speak for us,
His conqueror conquer'd Aldwyth.

HAROLD.                          Goodly news!

MORCAR. Doubt it not thou! Since Griffith's
head was sent
To Edward, she hath said it.

HAROLD.                      I had rather
She would have loved her husband. Aldwyth, Aldwyth,
Canst thou love me, thou knowing where I love?

ALDWYTH. I can, my lord, for mine own sake, for thine,
For England, for thy poor white dove, who flutters
Between thee and the porch, but then would find
Her nest within the cloister, and be still.

HAROLD. Canst thou love one, who cannot love again?

ALDWYTH. Full hope have I that love will answer love.

HAROLD. Then in the name of the great God, so be it!
Come, Aldred, join our hands before the hosts,
That all may see.

    [ALDRED _joins the hands of_ HAROLD _and_ ALDWYTH
    _and blesses them_.

VOICES.           Harold, Harold and Aldwyth!

HAROLD. Set forth our golden Dragon, let him flap
The wings that beat down Wales!
Advance our Standard of the Warrior,
Dark among gems and gold; and thou, brave banner,
Blaze like a night of fatal stars on those
Who read their doom and die.
Where lie the Norsemen? on the Derwent? ay
At Stamford-bridge.
Morcar, collect thy men; Edwin, my friend--
Thou lingerest.--Gurth,--
Last night King Edward came to me in dreams--
The rosy face and long down-silvering beard--
He told me I should conquer:--
I am no woman to put faith in dreams.
    (To his army.)
Last night King Edward came to me in dreams,
And told me we should conquer.

VOICES.                        Forward! Forward!
Harold and Holy Cross!

ALDWYTH.               The day is won!



SCENE II.--A PLAIN. BEFORE THE BATTLE OF STAMFORD-BRIDGE.

HAROLD _and his_ GUARD.


HAROLD. Who is it comes this way? Tostig?
(_Enter_ TOSTIG _with a small force_.)    O brother,
What art thou doing here?

TOSTIG.                   I am foraging
For Norway's army.

HAROLD.            I could take and slay thee.
Thou art in arms against us.

TOSTIG.                      Take and slay me,
For Edward loved me.

HAROLD.              Edward bad me spare thee.

TOSTIG. I hate King Edward, for he join'd with thee
To drive me outlaw'd. Take and slay me, I say,
Or I shall count thee fool.

HAROLD.                     Take thee, or free thee,
Free thee or slay thee, Norway will have war;
No man would strike with Tostig, save for Norway.
Thou art nothing in thine England, save for Norway,
Who loves not thee but war. What dost thou here,
Trampling thy mother's bosom into blood?

TOSTIG. She hath wean'd me from it with such bitterness.
I come for mine own Earldom, my Northumbria;
Thou hast given it to the enemy of our house.

HAROLD. Northumbria threw thee off, she will not have thee,
Thou hast misused her: and, O crowning crime!
Hast murder'd thine own guest, the son of Orm,
Gamel, at thine own hearth.

TOSTIG.                     The slow, fat fool!
He drawl'd and prated so, I smote him suddenly,
I knew not what I did. He held with Morcar.--
I hate myself for all things that I do.

HAROLD. And Morcar holds with us. Come back with him.
Know what thou dost; and we may find for thee,
So thou be chasten'd by thy banishment,
Some easier earldom.

TOSTIG.              What for Norway then?
He looks for land among us, he and his.

HAROLD. Seven feet of English land, or something more,
Seeing he is a giant.

TOSTIG.               That is noble!
That sounds of Godwin.

HAROLD.                Come thou back, and be
Once more a son of Godwin.

TOSTIG (_turns away_).     O brother, brother,
O Harold--

HAROLD (_laying his hand on_ TOSTIG'S _shoulder_).
          Nay then, come thou back to us!

TOSTIG (_after a pause turning to him_).  Never
shall any man say that I, that Tostig
Conjured the mightier Harold from his North
To do the battle for me here in England,
Then left him for the meaner! thee!--
Thou hast no passion for the House of Godwin--
Thou hast but cared to make thyself a king--
Thou hast sold me for a cry.--
Thou gavest thy voice against me in the Council--
I hate thee, and despise thee, and defy thee.
Farewell for ever!
                      [_Exit_.

HAROLD. On to Stamford-bridge!



SCENE III.


AFTER THE BATTLE OF STAMFORD-BRIDGE. BANQUET.

HAROLD _and_ ALDWYTH. GURTH, LEOFWIN, MORCAR, EDWIN,
_and other_ EARLS _and_ THANES.


VOICES. Hail! Harold! Aldwyth! hail, bridegroom and bride!

ALDWYTH (_talking with_ HAROLD).
Answer them thou!
Is this our marriage-banquet? Would the wines
Of wedding had been dash'd into the cups
Of victory, and our marriage and thy glory
Been drunk together! these poor hands but sew,
Spin, broider--would that they were man's to have held
The battle-axe by thee!

HAROLD.                 There _was_ a moment
When being forced aloof from all my guard,
And striking at Hardrada and his madmen
I had wish'd for any weapon.

ALDWYTH.                     Why art thou sad?

HAROLD. I have lost the boy who play'd at ball with me,
With whom I fought another fight than this
Of Stamford-bridge.

ALDWYTH.            Ay! ay! thy victories
Over our own poor Wales, when at thy side
He conquer'd with thee.

HAROLD.                 No--the childish fist
That cannot strike again.

ALDWYTH.                  Thou art too kindly.
Why didst thou let so many Norsemen hence?
Thy fierce forekings had clench'd their pirate hides
To the bleak church doors, like kites upon a barn.

HAROLD. Is there so great a need to tell thee why?

ALDWYTH. Yea, am I not thy wife?

VOICES.                          Hail, Harold, Aldwyth!
Bridegroom and bride!

ALDWYTH. Answer them!    [_To_ HAROLD.

HAROLD (_to all_).    Earls and Thanes!
Full thanks for your fair greeting of my bride!
Earls, Thanes, and all our countrymen! the day,
Our day beside the Derwent will not shine
Less than a star among the goldenest hours
Of Alfred, or of Edward his great son,
Or Athelstan, or English Ironside
Who fought with Knut, or Knut who coming Dane
Died English. Every man about his king
Fought like a king; the king like his own man,
No better; one for all, and all for one,
One soul! and therefore have we shatter'd back
The hugest wave from Norseland ever yet
Surged on us, and our battle-axes broken
The Raven's wing, and dumb'd his carrion croak
From the gray sea for ever. Many are gone--
Drink to the dead who died for us, the living
Who fought and would have died, but happier lived,
If happier be to live; they both have life
In the large mouth of England, till _her_ voice
Die with the world. Hail--hail!

MORCAR. May all invaders perish like Hardrada!
All traitors fail like Tostig.     [_All drink but_ HAROLD.

ALDWYTH.                       Thy cup's full!

HAROLD. I saw the hand of Tostig cover it.
Our dear, dead, traitor-brother, Tostig, him
Reverently we buried. Friends, had I been here,
Without too large self-lauding I must hold
The sequel had been other than his league
With Norway, and this battle. Peace be with him!
He was not of the worst. If there be those
At banquet in this hall, and hearing me--
For there be those I fear who prick'd the lion
To make him spring, that sight of Danish blood
Might serve an end not English--peace with them
Likewise, if they can be at peace with what
God gave us to divide us from the wolf!

ALDWYTH (_aside to_ HAROLD).
Make not our Morcar sullen: it is not wise.

HAROLD. Hail to the living who fought, the dead who fell!

VOICES. Hail, hail!

FIRST THANE. How ran that answer which King Harold gave
To his dead namesake, when he ask'd for England?

LEOFWIN. 'Seven feet of English earth, or something more,
Seeing he is a giant!'

FIRST THANE.           Then for the bastard
Six feet and nothing more!

LEOFWIN.                   Ay, but belike
Thou hast not learnt his measure.

FIRST THANE.                      By St. Edmund
I over-measure him. Sound sleep to the man
Here by dead Norway without dream or dawn!

SECOND THANE. What is he bragging still that he will come
To thrust our Harold's throne from under him?
My nurse would tell me of a molehill crying
To a mountain 'Stand aside and room for me!'

FIRST THANE. Let him come! let him come.
Here's to him, sink or swim!    [_Drinks_.

SECOND THANE.                God sink him!

FIRST THANE. Cannot hands which had the strength
To shove that stranded iceberg off our shores,
And send the shatter'd North again to sea,
Scuttle his cockle-shell? What's Brunanburg
To Stamford-bridge? a war-crash, and so hard,
So loud, that, by St. Dunstan, old St. Thor--
By God, we thought him dead--but our old Thor
Heard his own thunder again, and woke and came
Among us again, and mark'd the sons of those
Who made this Britain England, break the North:

    Mark'd how the war-axe swang,
    Heard how the war-horn sang,
    Mark'd how the spear-head sprang,
    Heard how the shield-wall rang,
    Iron on iron clang,
    Anvil on hammer bang--

SECOND THANE. Hammer on anvil, hammer on anvil. Old dog,
Thou art drunk, old dog!

FIRST THANE.             Too drunk to fight with thee!

SECOND THANE. Fight thou with thine own double, not with me,
Keep that for Norman William!

FIRST THANE.                  Down with William!

THIRD THANE. The washerwoman's brat!

FOURTH THANE.                        The tanner's bastard!

FIFTH THANE.
The Falaise byblow!

    [_Enter a_ THANE, _from Pevensey, spattered with mud_.

HAROLD.             Ay, but what late guest,
As haggard as a fast of forty days,
And caked and plaster'd with a hundred mires,
Hath stumbled on our cups?

THANE _from Pevensey_.     My lord the King!
William the Norman, for the wind had changed--

HAROLD. I felt it in the middle of that fierce fight
At Stamford-bridge. William hath landed, ha?

THANE _from Pevensey_.  Landed at Pevensey--I am from Pevensey--
Hath wasted all the land at Pevensey--
Hath harried mine own cattle--God confound him!
I have ridden night and day from Pevensey--
A thousand ships--a hundred thousand men--
Thousands of horses, like as many lions
Neighing and roaring as they leapt to land--

HAROLD. How oft in coming hast thou broken bread?

THANE _from Pevensey_.
Some thrice, or so.

HAROLD.             Bring not thy hollowness
On our full feast. Famine is fear, were it but
Of being starved. Sit down, sit down, and eat,
And, when again red-blooded, speak again;
(_Aside_.) The men that guarded England to the South
Were scatter'd to the harvest.... No power mine
To hold their force together.... Many are fallen
At Stamford-bridge ... the people stupid-sure
Sleep like their swine ... in South and North at once
I could not be.
     (_Aloud_.) Gurth, Leofwin, Morcar, Edwin!
(_Pointing to the revellers_.)
The curse of England! these are drown'd in wassail,
And cannot see the world but thro' their wines!
Leave them! and thee too, Aldwyth, must I leave--
Harsh is the news! hard is our honeymoon!
Thy pardon.    (_Turning round to his_ ATTENDANTS.)
            Break the banquet up ... Ye four!
And thou, my carrier-pigeon of black news,
Cram thy crop full, but come when thou art call'd.

                                      [_Exit_ HAROLD.




ACT V.


SCENE I.--A TENT ON A MOUND, FROM WHICH CAN BE SEEN THE FIELD OF
SENLAC.

HAROLD, _sitting; by him standing_ HUGH MARGOT _the Monk_, GURTH,
LEOFWIN,


HAROLD. Refer my cause, my crown to Rome!... The wolf
Mudded the brook and predetermined all.
Monk,
Thou hast said thy say, and had my constant 'No'
For all but instant battle. I hear no more.

MARGOT. Hear me again--for the last time. Arise,
Scatter thy people home, descend the hill,
Lay hands of full allegiance in thy Lord's
And crave his mercy, for the Holy Father
Hath given this realm of England to the Norman.

HAROLD. Then for the last time, monk, I ask again
When had the Lateran and the Holy Father
To do with England's choice of her own king?

MARGOT. Earl, the first Christian Caesar drew to the East
To leave the Pope dominion in the West
He gave him all the kingdoms of the West.

HAROLD. So!--did he?--Earl--I have a mind to play
The William with thine eyesight and thy tongue.
Earl--ay--thou art but a messenger of William.
I am weary--go: make me not wroth with thee!

MARGOT. Mock-king, I am the messenger of God,
His Norman Daniel! Mene, Mene, Tekel!
Is thy wrath Hell, that I should spare to cry,
Yon heaven is wroth with _thee?_ Hear me again!
Our Saints have moved the Church that moves the world,
And all the Heavens and very God: they heard--
They know King Edward's promise and thine--thine.

HAROLD. Should they not know free England crowns herself?
Not know that he nor I had power to promise?
Not know that Edward cancell'd his own promise?
And for my part therein--Back to that juggler,
                                        [_Rising_.
Tell him the saints are nobler than he dreams,
Tell him that God is nobler than the Saints,
And tell him we stand arm'd on Senlac Hill,
And bide the doom of God.

MARGOT.                   Hear it thro' me.
The realm for which thou art forsworn is cursed,
The babe enwomb'd and at the breast is cursed,
The corpse thou whelmest with thine earth is cursed,
The soul who fighteth on thy side is cursed,
The seed thou sowest in thy field is cursed,
The steer wherewith thou plowest thy field is cursed,
The fowl that fleeth o'er thy field is cursed,
And thou, usurper, liar--

HAROLD.                  Out, beast monk!
    [_Lifting his hand to strike him_. GURTH _stops the blow_.
I ever hated monks.

MARGOT.             I am but a voice
Among you: murder, martyr me if ye will--

HAROLD. Thanks, Gurth! The simple, silent, selfless man
Is worth a world of tonguesters. (_To_ MARGOT.) Get thee gone!
He means the thing he says. See him out safe!

LEOFWIN. He hath blown himself as red as fire with curses.
An honest fool! Follow me, honest fool,
But if thou blurt thy curse among our folk,
I know not--I may give that egg-bald head
The tap that silences.

HAROLD.                See him out safe.
                            [_Exeunt_ LEOFWIN _and_ MARGOT.

GURTH. Thou hast lost thine even temper, brother Harold!

HAROLD. Gurth, when I past by Waltham, my foundation
For men who serve the neighbour, not themselves,
I cast me down prone, praying; and, when I rose,
They told me that the Holy Rood had lean'd
And bow'd above me; whether that which held it
Had weaken'd, and the Rood itself were bound
To that necessity which binds us down;
Whether it bow'd at all but in their fancy;
Or if it bow'd, whether it symbol'd ruin
Or glory, who shall tell? but they were sad,
And somewhat sadden'd me.

GURTH.                    Yet if a fear,
Or shadow of a fear, lest the strange Saints
By whom thou swarest, should have power to balk
Thy puissance in this fight with him, who made
And heard thee swear--brother--_I_ have not sworn--
If the king fall, may not the kingdom fall?
But if I fall, I fall, and thou art king;
And, if I win, I win, and thou art king;
Draw thou to London, there make strength to breast
Whatever chance, but leave this day to me.

LEOFWIN (_entering_). And waste the land about thee as thou goest,
And be thy hand as winter on the field,
To leave the foe no forage.

HAROLD.                     Noble Gurth!
Best son of Godwin! If I fall, I fall--
The doom of God! How should the people fight
When the king flies? And, Leofwin, art thou mad?
How should the King of England waste the fields
Of England, his own people?--No glance yet
Of the Northumbrian helmet on the heath?

LEOFWIN. No, but a shoal of wives upon the heath,
And someone saw thy willy-nilly nun
Vying a tress against our golden fern.

HAROLD. Vying a tear with our cold dews, a sigh
With these low-moaning heavens. Let her be fetch'd.
We have parted from our wife without reproach,
Tho' we have dived thro' all her practices;
And that is well.

LEOFWIN.          I saw her even now:
She hath not left us.

HAROLD.               Nought of Morcar then?

GURTH. Nor seen, nor heard; thine, William's or his own
As wind blows, or tide flows: belike he watches,
If this war-storm in one of its rough rolls
Wash up that old crown of Northumberland.

HAROLD. I married her for Morcar--a sin against
The truth of love. Evil for good, it seems,
Is oft as childless of the good as evil
For evil.

LEOFWIN.  Good for good hath borne at times
A bastard false as William.

HAROLD.                     Ay, if Wisdom
Pair'd not with Good. But I am somewhat worn,
A snatch of sleep were like the peace of God.
Gurth, Leofwin, go once more about the hill--
What did the dead man call it--Sanguelac,
The lake of blood?

LEOFWIN.           A lake that dips in William
As well as Harold.

HAROLD.            Like enough. I have seen
The trenches dug, the palisades uprear'd
And wattled thick with ash and willow-wands;
Yea, wrought at them myself. Go round once more;
See all be sound and whole. No Norman horse
Can shatter England, standing shield by shield;
Tell that again to all.

GURTH.                  I will, good brother.

HAROLD. Our guardsman hath but toil'd his hand and foot,
I hand, foot, heart and head. Some wine!
    (_One pours wine into a goblet which he hands to_ HAROLD.)
                                         Too much!
What? we must use our battle-axe to-day.
Our guardsmen have slept well, since we came in?

LEOFWIN. Ay, slept and snored. Your second-sighted man
That scared the dying conscience of the king,
Misheard their snores for groans. They are up again
And chanting that old song of Brunanburg
Where England conquer'd.

HAROLD.                  That is well. The Norman,
What is he doing?

LEOFWIN.          Praying for Normandy;
Our scouts have heard the tinkle of their bells.

HAROLD. And our old songs are prayers for England too!
But by all Saints--

LEOFWIN.           Barring the Norman!

HAROLD.                                Nay,
Were the great trumpet blowing doomsday dawn,
I needs must rest. Call when the Norman moves--

                            [_Exeunt all, but_ HAROLD.

No horse--thousands of horses--our shield wall--
Wall--break it not--break not--break--    [_Sleeps_.

VISION OF EDWARD. Son Harold, I thy king, who came before
To tell thee thou shouldst win at Stamford-bridge,
Come yet once more, from where I am at peace,
Because I loved thee in my mortal day,
To tell thee them shalt die on Senlac hill--
Sanguelac!

VISION OF WULFNOTH. O brother, from my ghastly oubliette
I send my voice across the narrow seas--
No more, no more, dear brother, nevermore--
Sanguelac!

VISION OF TOSTIG. O brother, most unbrotherlike to me,
Thou gavest thy voice against me in my life,
I give my voice against thee from the grave--
Sanguelac!

VISION OF NORMAN SAINTS. O hapless Harold!
King but for an hour!
Thou swarest falsely by our blessed bones,
We give our voice against thee out of heaven!
Sanguelac! Sanguelac! The arrow! the arrow!

HAROLD (_starting up, battle-axe in hand_.) Away!
My battle-axe against your voices. Peace!
The king's last word--'the arrow!' I shall die--
I die for England then, who lived for England--
What nobler? men must die.
I cannot fall into a falser world--
I have done no man wrong. Tostig, poor brother,
Art _thou_ so anger'd?
Fain had I kept thine earldom in thy hands
Save for thy wild and violent will that wrench'd
All hearts of freemen from thee. I could do
No other than this way advise the king
Against the race of Godwin. Is it possible
That mortal men should bear their earthly heats
Into yon bloodless world, and threaten us thence
Unschool'd of Death? Thus then thou art revenged--
I left our England naked to the South
To meet thee in the North. The Norseman's raid
Hath helpt the Norman, and the race of Godwin
Hath ruin'd Godwin. No--our waking thoughts
Suffer a stormless shipwreck in the pools
Of sullen slumber, and arise again
Disjointed: only dreams--where mine own self
Takes part against myself! Why? for a spark
Of self-disdain born in me when I sware
Falsely to him, the falser Norman, over
His gilded ark of mummy-saints, by whom
I knew not that I sware,--not for myself--
For England--yet not wholly--

    _Enter_ EDITH.

                             Edith, Edith,
Get thou into thy cloister as the king
Will'd it: be safe: the perjury-mongering Count
Hath made too good an use of Holy Church
To break her close! There the great God of truth
Fill all thine hours with peace!--A lying devil
Hath haunted me--mine oath--my wife--I fain
Had made my marriage not a lie; I could not:
Thou art my bride! and thou in after years
Praying perchance for this poor soul of mine
In cold, white cells beneath an icy moon--
This memory to thee!--and this to England,
My legacy of war against the Pope
From child to child, from Pope to Pope, from age to age,
Till the sea wash her level with her shores,
Or till the Pope be Christ's.

    _Enter_ ALDWYTH.

ALDWYTH (_to_ EDITH).         Away from him!

EDITH. I will.... I have not spoken to the king
One word; and one I must. Farewell!    [_Going_.

HAROLD.                             Not yet.
Stay.

EDITH. To what use?

HAROLD.             The king commands thee, woman!
    (_To_ ALDWYTH.)
Have thy two brethren sent their forces in?

ALDWYTH. Nay, I fear not.

HAROLD.                   Then there's no force in thee!
Thou didst possess thyself of Edward's ear
To part me from the woman that I loved!
Thou didst arouse the fierce Northumbrians!
Thou hast been false to England and to me!--
As ... in some sort ... I have been false to thee.
Leave me. No more--Pardon on both sides--Go!

ALDWYTH. Alas, my lord, I loved thee.

HAROLD (_bitterly_).                  With a love
Passing thy love for Griffyth! wherefore now
Obey my first and last commandment. Go!

ALDWYTH. O Harold! husband! Shall we meet again?

HAROLD. After the battle--after the battle. Go.

ALDWYTH. I go. (_Aside_.) That I could stab her standing there!
                                                  [_Exit_ ALDWYTH.

EDITH. Alas, my lord, she loved thee.

HAROLD.                               Never! never!

EDITH. I saw it in her eyes!

HAROLD.                      I see it in thine.
And not on thee--nor England--fall God's doom!

EDITH. On _thee?_ on me. And thou art England! Alfred
Was England. Ethelred was nothing. England
Is but her king, and thou art Harold!

HAROLD.                               Edith,
The sign in heaven--the sudden blast at sea--
My fatal oath--the dead Saints--the dark dreams--
The Pope's Anathema--the Holy Rood
That bow'd to me at Waltham--Edith, if
I, the last English King of England--

EDITH.                               No,
First of a line that coming from the people,
And chosen by the people--

HAROLD.                   And fighting for
And dying for the people--

EDITH.                    Living! living!

HAROLD. Yea so, good cheer! thou art Harold, I am Edith!
Look not thus wan!

EDITH.             What matters how I look?
Have we not broken Wales and Norseland? slain,
Whose life was all one battle, incarnate war,
Their giant-king, a mightier man-in-arms
Than William.

HAROLD.       Ay, my girl, no tricks in him--
No bastard he! when all was lost, he yell'd,
And bit his shield, and dash'd it on the ground,
And swaying his two-handed sword about him,
Two deaths at every swing, ran in upon us
And died so, and I loved him as I hate
This liar who made me liar. If Hate can kill,
And Loathing wield a Saxon battle-axe--

EDITH. Waste not thy might before the battle!

HAROLD.                                       No,
And thou must hence. Stigand will see thee safe,
And so--Farewell.    [_He is going, but turns back_.
The ring thou darest not wear.
I have had it fashion'd, see, to meet my hand.
          [HAROLD _shows the ring which is on his finger_.

Farewell!    [_He is going, but turns back again_.
I am dead as Death this day to ought of earth's
Save William's death or mine.

EDITH.                        Thy death!--to-day!
Is it not thy birthday?

HAROLD.                 Ay, that happy day!
A birthday welcome! happy days and many!
One--this!    [_They embrace_.
Look, I will bear thy blessing into the battle
And front the doom of God.

NORMAN CRIES (_heard in the distance_).
                           Ha Rou! Ha Rou!

    _Enter_ GURTH.

GURTH. The Norman moves!

HAROLD.                  Harold and Holy Cross!

                           [_Exeunt_ HAROLD _and_ GURTH.

    _Enter_ STIGAND.

STIGAND. Our Church in arms--the lamb the lion--not
Spear into pruning-hook--the counter way--
Cowl, helm; and crozier, battle-axe. Abbot Alfwig,
Leofric, and all the monks of Peterboro'
Strike for the king; but I, old wretch, old Stigand,
With hands too limp to brandish iron--and yet
I have a power--would Harold ask me for it--
I have a power.

EDITH.          What power, holy father?

STIGAND. Power now from Harold to command thee hence
And see thee safe from Senlac.

EDITH.                         I remain!

STIGAND. Yea, so will I, daughter, until I find
Which way the battle balance. I can see it
From where we stand: and, live or die, I would
I were among them!

CANONS _from Waltham (singing without)_.

    Salva patriam
    Sancte Pater,
    Salva Fili,
    Salva Spiritus,
    Salva patriam,
      Sancta Mater.[1]

  [Footnote 1: The _a_ throughout these Latin hymns should be
  sounded broad, as in 'father.']

EDITH. Are those the blessed angels quiring, father?

STIGAND. No, daughter, but the canons out of Waltham,
The king's foundation, that have follow'd him.

EDITH. O God of battles, make their wall of shields
Firm as thy cliffs, strengthen their palisades!
What is that whirring sound?

STIGAND.                     The Norman arrow!

EDITH. Look out upon the battle--is he safe?

STIGAND. The king of England stands between his banners.
He glitters on the crowning of the hill.
God save King Harold!

EDITH.               --chosen by his people
And fighting for his people!

STIGAND.                     There is one
Come as Goliath came of yore--he flings
His brand in air and catches it again,
He is chanting some old warsong.

EDITH.                           And no David
To meet him?

STIGAND.     Ay, there springs a Saxon on him,
Falls--and another falls.

EDITH.                    Have mercy on us!

STIGAND. Lo! our good Gurth hath smitten him to the death.

EDITH. So perish all the enemies of Harold!

CANONS (_singing_).

    Hostis in Angliam
      Ruit praedator,
    Illorum, Domine,
      Scutum scindatur!
    Hostis per Angliae
      Plagas bacchatur;
      Casa crematur,
      Pastor fugatur
      Grex trucidatur--

STIGAND. Illos trucida, Domine.

EDITH.                          Ay, good father.

CANONS (_singing_).

    Illorum scelera
      Poena sequatur!

ENGLISH CRIES. Harold and Holy Cross! Out! out!

STIGAND.                                        Our javelins
Answer their arrows. All the Norman foot
Are storming up the hill. The range of knights
Sit, each a statue on his horse, and wait.

ENGLISH CRIES. Harold and God Almighty!

NORMAN CRIES.                           Ha Rou! Ha Rou!

CANONS (_singing_).

    Eques cum pedite
      Praepediatur!
    Illorum in lacrymas
      Cruor fundatur!
    Pereant, pereant,
      Anglia precatur.

STIGAND. Look, daughter, look.

EDITH.                         Nay, father, look for me!

STIGAND. Our axes lighten with a single flash
About the summit of the hill, and heads
And arms are sliver'd off and splinter'd by
Their lightning--and they fly--the Norman flies.

EDITH. Stigand, O father, have we won the day?

STIGAND. No, daughter, no--they fall behind the horse--
Their horse are thronging to the barricades;
I see the gonfanon of Holy Peter
Floating above their helmets--ha! he is down!

EDITH. He down! Who down?

STIGAND.                  The Norman Count is down.

EDITH. So perish all the enemies of England!

STIGAND. No, no, he hath risen again--he bares his face--
Shouts something--he points onward--all their horse
Swallow the hill locust-like, swarming up.

EDITH. O God of battles, make his battle-axe keen
As thine own sharp-dividing justice, heavy
As thine own bolts that fall on crimeful heads
Charged with the weight of heaven wherefrom they fall!

CANONS (_singing_).

    Jacta tonitrua
      Deus bellator!
    Surgas e tenebris,
      Sis vindicator!
    Fulmina, fulmina
      Deus vastator!

EDITH. O God of battles, they are three to one,
Make thou one man as three to roll them down!

CANONS (_singing_).

    Equus cum equite
      Dejiciatur!
    Acies, Acies
      Prona sternatur!
    Illorum lanceas
      Frange Creator!

STIGAND. Yea, yea, for how their lances snap and shiver
Against the shifting blaze of Harold's axe!
War-woodman of old Woden, how he fells
The mortal copse of faces! There! And there!
The horse and horseman cannot meet the shield,
The blow that brains the horseman cleaves the horse,
The horse and horseman roll along the hill,
They fly once more, they fly, the Norman flies!

    Equus cum equite
      Praecipitatur.

EDITH. O God, the God of truth hath heard my cry.
Follow them, follow them, drive them to the sea!

    Illorum scelera
      Poena sequatur!

STIGAND. Truth! no; a lie; a trick, a Norman trick!
They turn on the pursuer, horse against foot,
They murder all that follow.

EDITH.                       Have mercy on us!

STIGAND. Hot-headed fools--to burst the wall of shields!
They have broken the commandment of the king!

EDITH. His oath was broken--O holy Norman Saints,
Ye that are now of heaven, and see beyond
Your Norman shrines, pardon it, pardon it,
That he forsware himself for all he loved,
Me, me and all! Look out upon the battle!

STIGAND. They thunder again upon the barricades.
My sight is eagle, but the strife so thick--
This is the hottest of it: hold, ash! hold, willow!

ENGLISH CRIES. Out, out!

NORMAN CRIES.            Ha Rou!

STIGAND. Ha! Gurth hath leapt upon him
And slain him: he hath fallen.

EDITH.                         And I am heard.
Glory to God in the Highest! fallen, fallen!

STIGAND. No, no, his horse--he mounts another--wields
His war-club, dashes it on Gurth, and Gurth,
Our noble Gurth, is down!

EDITH.                    Have mercy on us!

STIGAND. And Leofwin is down!

EDITH.                        Have mercy on us!
O Thou that knowest, let not my strong prayer
Be weaken'd in thy sight, because I love
The husband of another!

NORMAN CRIES.           Ha Rou! Ha Rou!

EDITH. I do not hear our English war-cry.

STIGAND.                                  No.

EDITH. Look out upon the battle--is he safe?

STIGAND. He stands between the banners with the dead
So piled about him he can hardly move.

EDITH (_takes up the war-cry_).
Out! out!

NORMAN CRIES. Ha Rou!

EDITH (_cries out_).  Harold and Holy Cross!

NORMAN CRIES. Ha Rou! Ha Rou!

EDITH.                        What is that whirring sound?

STIGAND. The Norman sends his arrows up to Heaven,
They fall on those within the palisade!

EDITH. Look out upon the hill--is Harold there?

STIGAND. Sanguelac--Sanguelac--the arrow--the arrow!--away!



SCENE II--FIELD OF THE DEAD. NIGHT.

ALDWYTH _and_ EDITH.


ALDWYTH. O Edith, art thou here? O Harold, Harold--
Our Harold--we shall never see him more.

EDITH. For there was more than sister in my kiss,
And so the saints were wroth. I cannot love them,
For they are Norman saints--and yet I should--
They are so much holier than their harlot's son
With whom they play'd their game against the king!

ALDWYTH, The king is slain, the kingdom over-thrown!

EDITH. No matter!

ALDWYTH.          How no matter, Harold slain?--
I cannot find his body. O help me thou!
O Edith, if I ever wrought against thee,
Forgive me thou, and help me here!

EDITH.                             No matter!

ALDWYTH. Not help me, nor forgive me?

EDITH.                                So thou saidest.

ALDWYTH. I say it now, forgive me!

EDITH.                             Cross me not!
I am seeking one who wedded me in secret.
Whisper! God's angels only know it. Ha!
What art thou doing here among the dead?
They are stripping the dead bodies naked yonder,
And thou art come to rob them of their rings!

ALDWYTH. O Edith, Edith, I have lost both crown
And husband.

EDITH.       So have I.

ALDWYTH.                I tell thee, girl,
I am seeking my dead Harold.

EDITH.                       And I mine!
The Holy Father strangled him with a hair
Of Peter, and his brother Tostig helpt;
The wicked sister clapt her hands and laugh'd;
Then all the dead fell on him.

ALDWYTH.                       Edith, Edith--

EDITH. What was he like, this husband? like to thee?
Call not for help from me. I knew him not.
He lies not here: not close beside the standard.
Here fell the truest, manliest hearts of England.
Go further hence and find him.

ALDWYTH.                       She is crazed!

EDITH. That doth not matter either. Lower the light.
He must be here.

    _Enter two_ CANONS, OSGOD _and_ ATHELRIC, _with
    torches. They turn over the dead bodies and
    examine them as they pass_.

OSGOD.           I think that this is Thurkill.

ATHELRIC. More likely Godric.

OSGOD.                       I am sure this body
Is Alfwig, the king's uncle.

ATHELRIC.                    So it is!
No, no--brave Gurth, one gash from brow to knee!

OSGOD. And here is Leofwin.

EDITH.                      And here is _He!_

ALDWYTH. Harold? Oh no--nay, if it were--my God,
They have so maim'd and murder'd all his face
There is no man can swear to him.

EDITH.                            But one woman!
Look you, we never mean to part again.
I have found him, I am happy.
Was there not someone ask'd me for forgiveness?
I yield it freely, being the true wife
Of this dead King, who never bore revenge.

    _Enter_ COUNT WILLIAM _and_ WILLIAM MALET.

WILLIAM. Who be these women? And what body is this?

EDITH. Harold, thy better!

WILLIAM.                   Ay, and what art thou?

EDITH. His wife!

MALET.           Not true, my girl, here is the Queen!
                                      [_Pointing out_ ALDWYTH.

WILLIAM (_to_ ALDWYTH).
Wast thou his Queen?

ALDWYTH.             I was the Queen of Wales.

WILLIAM. Why then of England. Madam, fear us not.
(_To_ MALET.) Knowest thou this other?

MALET.                                 When I visited England,
Some held she was his wife in secret--some--
Well--some believed she was his paramour.

EDITH. Norman, thou liest! liars all of you,
Your Saints and all! I am his wife! and she--
For look, our marriage ring!
               [_She draws it off the finger of_ HAROLD.
                             I lost it somehow--
I lost it, playing with it when I was wild.
_That_ bred the doubt! but I am wiser now ...
I am too wise.... Will none among you all
Bear me true witness--only for this once--
That I have found it here again?    [_She puts it on_.
                                 And thou,
Thy wife am I for ever and evermore.
                         [_Falls on the body and dies_.

WILLIAM. Death!--and enough of death for this one day,
The day of St. Calixtus, and the day,
My day when I was born.

MALET.                  And this dead king's
Who, king or not, hath kinglike fought and fallen,
His birthday, too. It seems but yestereven
I held it with him in his English halls,
His day, with all his rooftree ringing 'Harold,'
Before he fell into the snare of Guy;
When all men counted Harold would be king,
And Harold was most happy.

WILLIAM.                   Thou art half English
Take them away!
Malet, I vow to build a church to God
Here on the hill of battle; let our high altar
Stand where their standard fell ... where these two lie.
Take them away, I do not love to see them.
Pluck the dead woman off the dead man, Malet!

MALET. Faster than ivy. Must I hack her arms off?
How shall I part them?

WILLIAM.               Leave them. Let them be!
Bury him and his paramour together.
He that was false in oath to me, it seems
Was false to his own wife. We will not give him
A Christian burial: yet he was a warrior,
And wise, yea truthful, till that blighted vow
Which God avenged to-day.
Wrap them together in a purple cloak
And lay them both upon the waste sea-shore
At Hastings, there to guard the land for which
He did forswear himself--a warrior--ay,
And but that Holy Peter fought for us,
And that the false Northumbrian held aloof,
And save for that chance arrow which the Saints
Sharpen'd and sent against him--who can tell?--
Three horses had I slain beneath me: twice
I thought that all was lost. Since I knew battle,
And that was from my boyhood, never yet--
No, by the splendour of God--have I fought men
Like Harold and his brethren, and his guard
Of English. Every man about his king
Fell where he stood. They loved him: and, pray God
My Normans may but move as true with me
To the door of death. Of one self-stock at first,
Make them again one people--Norman, English;
And English, Norman; we should have a hand
To grasp the world with, and a foot to stamp it ...
Flat. Praise the Saints, It is over. No more blood!
I am king of England, so they thwart me not,
And I will rule according to their laws.
(_To_ ALDWYTH.) Madam, we will entreat thee with all honour.

ALDWYTH. My punishment is more than I can bear.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

INDEX OF FIRST LINES




_Note_

_To those unacquainted with Tennyson's conscientious methods, it may
seem strange that a volume of 160 pages is necessary to contain those
poems written and published by him during his active literary career,
and ultimately rejected as unsatisfactory. Of this considerable body
of verse, a great part was written, not in youth or old age, but while
Tennyson's powers were at their greatest. Whatever reasons may once
have existed for suppressing the poems that follow, the student of
English literature is entitled to demand that the whole body of
Tennyson's work should now be open, without restriction or impediment,
to the critical study to which the works of his compeers are
subjected._

_The bibliographical notes prefixed to the various poems give, in every
case, the date and medium of first publication._

=Timbuctoo=

A Poem Which Obtained The Chancellor's Medal At The
_Cambridge Commencement_  MDCCCXXIX

By
A. Tennyson
Of Trinity College

[Printed in Cambridge _Chronicle and Journal_ of Friday, July 10,
1829, and at the University Press by James Smith, among the
_Prolusiones Academicae Praemiis annuis dignatae et in Curia
Cantabrigiensi Recitatae Comitiis Maximis_, MDCCCXXIX. Republished in
_Cambridge Prize Poems_, 1813 to 1858, by Messrs. Macmillan in 1859,
without alteration; and in 1893 in the appendix to a reprint of _Poems
by Two Brothers_].


=Timbuctoo=

    Deep in that lion-haunted inland lies
    A mystic city, goal of high Emprize.[A]
      --CHAPMAN.

  I stood upon the Mountain which o'erlooks
  The narrow seas, whose rapid interval
  Parts Afric from green Europe, when the Sun
  Had fall'n below th' Atlantick, and above
  The silent Heavens were blench'd with faery light,
  Uncertain whether faery light or cloud,
  Flowing Southward, and the chasms of deep, deep blue
  Slumber'd unfathomable, and the stars
  Were flooded over with clear glory and pale.
  I gaz'd upon the sheeny coast beyond,
  There where the Giant of old Time infixed
  The limits of his prowess, pillars high
  Long time eras'd from Earth: even as the sea
  When weary of wild inroad buildeth up
  Huge mounds whereby to stay his yeasty waves.
  And much I mus'd on legends quaint and old
  Which whilome won the hearts of all on Earth
  Toward their brightness, ev'n as flame draws air;
  But had their being in the heart of Man
  As air is th' life of flame: and thou wert then
  A center'd glory-circled Memory,
  Divinest Atalantis, whom the waves
  Have buried deep, and thou of later name
  Imperial Eldorado root'd with gold:
  Shadows to which, despite all shocks of Change,
  All on-set of capricious Accident,
  Men clung with yearning Hope which would not die.
  As when in some great City where the walls
  Shake, and the streets with ghastly faces throng'd
  Do utter forth a subterranean voice,
  Among the inner columns far retir'd
  At midnight, in the lone Acropolis.
  Before the awful Genius of the place
  Kneels the pale Priestess in deep faith, the while
  Above her head the weak lamp dips and winks
  Unto the fearful summoning without:
  Nathless she ever clasps the marble knees,
  Bathes the cold hand with tears, and gazeth on
  Those eyes which wear no light but that wherewith
  Her phantasy informs them.

                   Where are ye
  Thrones of the Western wave, fair Islands green?
  Where are your moonlight halls, your cedarn glooms,
  The blossoming abysses of your hills?
  Your flowering Capes and your gold-sanded bays
  Blown round with happy airs of odorous winds?
  Where are the infinite ways which, Seraphtrod,
  Wound thro' your great Elysian solitudes,
  Whose lowest depths were, as with visible love,
  Fill'd with Divine effulgence, circumfus'd,
  Flowing between the clear and polish'd stems,
  And ever circling round their emerald cones
  In coronals and glories, such as gird
  The unfading foreheads of the Saints in Heaven?
  For nothing visible, they say, had birth
  In that blest ground but it was play'd about
  With its peculiar glory. Then I rais'd
  My voice and cried 'Wide Afric, doth thy Sun
  Lighten, thy hills enfold a City as fair
  As those which starr'd the night o' the Elder World?
  Or is the rumour of thy Timbuctoo
  A dream as frail as those of ancient Time?'

  A curve of whitening, flashing, ebbing light!
  A rustling of white wings! The bright descent
  Of a young Seraph! and he stood beside me
  There on the ridge, and look'd into my face
  With his unutterable, shining orbs,
  So that with hasty motion I did veil
  My vision with both hands, and saw before me
  Such colour'd spots as dance athwart the eyes
  Of those that gaze upon the noonday Sun.
  Girt with a Zone of flashing gold beneath
  His breast, and compass'd round about his brow
  With triple arch of everchanging bows,
  And circled with the glory of living light
  And alternations of all hues, he stood.
  'O child of man, why muse you here alone
  Upon the Mountain, on the dreams of old
  Which fill'd the Earth with passing loveliness,
  Which flung strange music on the howling winds,
  And odours rapt from remote Paradise?
  Thy sense is clogg'd with dull mortality,
  Thy spirit fetter'd with the bond of clay:
  Open thine eye and see.'

                    I look'd, but not
  Upon his face, for it was wonderful
  With its exceeding brightness, and the light
  Of the great angel mind which look'd from out
  The starry glowing of his restless eyes.
  I felt my soul grow mighty, and my spirit
  With supernatural excitation bound
  Within me, and my mental eye grew large
  With such a vast circumference of thought,
  That in my vanity I seem'd to stand
  Upon the outward verge and bound alone
  Of full beatitude. Each failing sense
  As with a momentary flash of light
  Grew thrillingly distinct and keen. I saw
  The smallest grain that dappled the dark Earth,
  The indistinctest atom in deep air,
  The Moon's white cities, and the opal width
  Of her small glowing lakes, her silver heights
  Unvisited with dew of vagrant cloud,
  And the unsounded, undescended depth
  Of her black hollows. The clear Galaxy
  Shorn of its hoary lustre, wonderful,
  Distinct and vivid with sharp points of light
  Blaze within blaze, an unimagin'd depth
  And harmony of planet-girded Suns
  And moon-encircled planets, wheel in wheel,
  Arch'd the wan Sapphire. Nay, the hum of men,
  Or other things talking in unknown tongues,
  And notes of busy life in distant worlds
  Beat like a far wave on my anxious ear.

  A maze of piercing, trackless, thrilling thoughts
  Involving and embracing each with each
  Rapid as fire, inextricably link'd,
  Expanding momently with every sight
  And sound which struck the palpitating sense,
  The issue of strong impulse, hurried through
  The riv'n rapt brain: as when in some large lake
  From pressure of descendant crags, which lapse
  Disjointed, crumbling from their parent slope
  At slender interval, the level calm
  Is ridg'd with restless and increasing spheres
  Which break upon each other, each th' effect
  Of separate impulse, but more fleet and strong
  Than its precursor, till the eyes in vain
  Amid the wild unrest of swimming shade
  Dappled with hollow and alternate rise
  Of interpenetrated arc, would scan
  Definite round.
                   I know not if I shape
  These things with accurate similitude
  From visible objects, for but dimly now,
  Less vivid than a half-forgotten dream,
  The memory of that mental excellence
  Comes o'er me, and it may be I entwine
  The indecision of my present mind
  With its past clearness, yet it seems to me
  As even then the torrent of quick thought
  Absorbed me from the nature of itself
  With its own fleetness. Where is he that, borne
  Adown the sloping of an arrowy stream,
  Could link his shallop to the fleeting edge,
  And muse midway with philosophic calm
  Upon the wondrous laws which regulate
  The fierceness of the bounding element?
  My thoughts which long had grovell'd in the slime
  Of this dull world, like dusky worms which house
  Beneath unshaken waters, but at once
  Upon some earth-awakening day of spring
  Do pass from gloom to glory, and aloft
  Winnow the purple, bearing on both sides
  Double display of starlit wings which burn
  Fanlike and fibred, with intensest bloom:
  E'en so my thoughts, erewhile so low, now felt
  Unutterable buoyancy and strength
  To bear them upward through the trackless fields
  Of undefin'd existence far and free.

  Then first within the South methought I saw
  A wilderness of spires, and chrystal pile
  Of rampart upon rampart, dome on dome,
  Illimitable range of battlement
  On battlement, and the Imperial height
  Of Canopy o'ercanopied.
                              Behind,
  In diamond light, upsprung the dazzling Cones
  Of Pyramids, as far surpassing Earth's
  As Heaven than Earth is fairer. Each aloft
  Upon his renown'd Eminence bore globes
  Of wheeling suns, or stars, or semblances
  Of either, showering circular abyss
  Of radiance. But the glory of the place
  Stood out a pillar'd front of burnish'd gold
  Interminably high, if gold it were
  Or metal more ethereal, and beneath
  Two doors of blinding brilliance, where no gaze
  Might rest, stood open, and the eye could scan
  Through length of porch and lake and boundless
      hall,
  Part of a throne of fiery flame, wherefrom
  The snowy skirting of a garment hung,
  And glimpse of multitudes of multitudes
  That minister'd around it--if I saw
  These things distinctly, for my human brain
  Stagger'd beneath the vision, and thick night
  Came down upon my eyelids, and I fell.

  With ministering hand he rais'd me up;
  Then with a mournful and ineffable smile,
  Which but to look on for a moment fill'd
  My eyes with irresistible sweet tears,
  In accents of majestic melody,
  Like a swol'n river's gushings in still night
  Mingled with floating music, thus he spake:
  'There is no mightier Spirit than I to sway
  The heart of man: and teach him to attain
  By shadowing forth the Unattainable;
  And step by step to scale that mighty stair
  Whose landing-place is wrapt about with clouds
  Of glory of Heaven.[B] With earliest Light of Spring,
  And in the glow of sallow Summertide,
  And in red Autumn when the winds are wild
  With gambols, and when full-voiced Winter roofs
  The headland with inviolate white snow,
  I play about his heart a thousand ways,
  Visit his eyes with visions, and his ears
  With harmonies of wind and wave and wood
  --Of winds which tell of waters, and of waters
  Betraying the close kisses of the wind--
  And win him unto me: and few there be
  So gross of heart who have not felt and known
  A higher than they see: They with dim eyes
  Behold me darkling. Lo! I have given _thee_
  To understand my presence, and to feel
  My fullness; I have fill'd thy lips with power.
  I have rais'd thee higher to the Spheres of Heaven,
  Man's first, last home: and thou with ravish'd sense
  Listenest the lordly music flowing from
  Th' illimitable years. I am the Spirit,
  The permeating life which courseth through
  All th' intricate and labyrinthine veins
  Of the great vine of _Fable_, which, outspread
  With growth of shadowing leaf and clusters rare,
  Reacheth to every corner under Heaven,
  Deep-rooted in the living soil of truth:
  So that men's hopes and fears take refuge in
  The fragrance of its complicated glooms
  And cool impleached twilights. Child of Man,
  See'st thou yon river, whose translucent wave,
  Forth issuing from darkness, windeth through
  The argent streets o' the City, imaging
  The soft inversion of her tremulous Domes;
  Her gardens frequent with the stately Palm,
  Her Pagods hung with music of sweet bells:
  Her obelisks of ranged Chrysolite,
  Minarets and towers? Lo! how he passeth by,
  And gulphs himself in sands, as not enduring
  To carry through the world those waves, which bore
  The reflex of my City in their depths.
  Oh City! Oh latest Throne! where I was rais'd
  To be a mystery of loveliness
  Unto all eyes, the time is well nigh come
  When I must render up this glorious home
  To keen _Discovery_: soon yon brilliant towers
  Shall darken with the waving of her wand;
  Darken, and shrink and shiver into huts,
  Black specks amid a waste of dreary sand,
  Low-built, mud-walled, Barbarian settlement,
  How chang'd from this fair City!'
                    Thus far the Spirit:
  Then parted Heavenward on the wing: and I
  Was left alone on Calpe, and the Moon
  Had fallen from the night, and all was dark!


[The following review of 'Timbuctoo' was published in the _Athenaeum_
of 22nd July, 1829: 'We have accustomed ourselves to think, perhaps
without any very good reason, that poetry was likely to perish among
us for a considerable period after the great generation of poets which
is now passing away. The age seems determined to contradict us, and
that in the most decided manner; for it has put forth poetry by a
young man, and that where we should least expect it--namely, in a
prize poem. These productions have often been ingenious and elegant
but we have never before seen one of them which indicated really
first-rate poetical genius, and which would have done honour to any
men that ever wrote. Such, we do not hesitate to affirm, is the little
work before us; and the examiners seem to have felt it like ourselves,
for they have assigned the prize to the author, though the measure in
which he writes was never before, we believe, thus selected for
honour. We extract a few lines to justify our admiration (50 lines,
62-112, quoted). How many men have lived for a century who could equal
this?' At the time when this highly eulogistic notice of the youthful
unknown poet appeared, the _Athenaeum_ was edited by John Sterling and
Frederick Denison Maurice, its then proprietors.]


[Footnote A: Mr Swinburne failed to find this couplet in any of
Chapman's original poems or translations, and was of opinion that it
is Tennyson's own.]

[Footnote B: Be ye perfect even as your Father in Heaven is perfect.]




=Poems Chiefly Lyrical=

[The poems numbered I-XXIV which follow, were published in 1830 in the
volume _Poems chiefly Lyrical_. (London: Effingham Wilson, Royal
Exchange, 1830.) They were never republished by Tennyson.]




I

=The 'How' and the 'Why'=

      I am any man's suitor,
      If any will be my tutor:
  Some say this life is pleasant,
      Some think it speedeth fast:
  In time there is no present,
      In eternity no future,
      In eternity no past.
  We laugh, we cry, we are born, we die,
  Who will riddle me the _how_ and the _why_?

  The bulrush nods unto his brother
  The wheatears whisper to each other:
  What is it they say? What do they there?
  Why two and two make four? Why round is not square?
  Why the rocks stand still, and the light clouds fly?
  Why the heavy oak groans, and the white willows sigh?
  Why deep is not high, and high is not deep?
  Whether we wake or whether we sleep?
  Whether we sleep or whether we die?
  How you are you? Why I am I?
  Who will riddle me the _how_ and the _why_?

  The world is somewhat; it goes on somehow;
  But what is the meaning of _then_ and _now_!
  I feel there is something; but how and what?
  I know there is somewhat; but what and why!
  I cannot tell if that somewhat be I.

  The little bird pipeth 'why! why!'
  In the summerwoods when the sun falls low,
  And the great bird sits on the opposite bough,
  And stares in his face and shouts 'how? how?'
  And the black owl scuds down the mellow twilight,
  And chaunts 'how? how?' the whole of the night.

  Why the life goes when the blood is spilt?
  What the life is? where the soul may lie?
  Why a church is with a steeple built;
  And a house with a chimney-pot?
  Who will riddle me the how and the what?
  Who will riddle me the what and the why?




II

=The Burial of Love=

      His eyes in eclipse,
      Pale cold his lips,
  The light of his hopes unfed,
      Mute his tongue,
      His bow unstrung
  With the tears he hath shed,
  Backward drooping his graceful head.

      Love is dead;
      His last arrow sped;
  He hath not another dart;
      Go--carry him to his dark deathbed;
  Bury him in the cold, cold heart--
      Love is dead.

  Oh, truest love! art thou forlorn,
      And unrevenged? Thy pleasant wiles
  Forgotten, and thine innocent joy?
      Shall hollow-hearted apathy,
  The cruellest form of perfect scorn,
      With langour of most hateful smiles,
  For ever write
  In the weathered light
      Of the tearless eye
      An epitaph that all may spy?
      No! sooner she herself shall die.

  For her the showers shall not fall,
  Nor the round sun that shineth to all;
      Her light shall into darkness change;
  For her the green grass shall not spring,
  Nor the rivers flow, nor the sweet birds sing,
      Till Love have his full revenge.

=To ----=

  Sainted Juliet! dearest name!
      If to love be life alone,
        Divinest Juliet,
      I love thee, and live; and yet
  Love unreturned is like the fragrant flame
      Folding the slaughter of the sacrifice
      Offered to Gods upon an altarthrone;
  My heart is lighted at thine eyes,
  Changed into fire, and blown about with sighs.

=Song=

  I

      I' the glooming light
      Of middle night,
      So cold and white,
  Worn Sorrow sits by the moaning wave;
      Beside her are laid,
      Her mattock and spade,
  For she hath half delved her own deep grave.
      Alone she is there:
  The white clouds drizzle: her hair falls loose;
      Her shoulders are bare;
  Her tears are mixed with the bearded dews.

  II

      Death standeth by;
      She will not die;
      With glazed eye
  She looks at her grave: she cannot sleep;
      Ever alone
      She maketh her moan:
  She cannot speak; she can only weep;
      For she will not hope.
  The thick snow falls on her flake by flake,
      The dull wave mourns down the slope,
  The world will not change, and her heart will not break.

=Song=

  I

  Every day hath its night:
      Every night its morn:
  Through dark and bright
      Winged hours are borne;
          Ah! welaway!
  Seasons flower and fade;
      Golden calm and storm
          Mingle day by day.
      There is no bright form
  Doth not cast a shade--
          Ah! welaway!

  II

  When we laugh, and our mirth
      Apes the happy vein,
  We're so kin to earth
      Pleasuance fathers pain--
          Ah! welaway!
  Madness laugheth loud:
      Laughter bringeth tears:
          Eyes are worn away
      Till the end of fears
  Cometh in the shroud,
          Ah! welaway!

  III

  All is change, woe or weal;
      Joy is sorrow's brother;
  Grief and sadness steal
      Symbols of each other;
          Ah! welaway!
  Larks in heaven's cope
      Sing: the culvers mourn
          All the livelong day.
      Be not all forlorn;
  Let us weep in hope--
          Ah! welaway!

=Hero to Leander=

  Oh go not yet, my love,
      The night is dark and vast;
  The white moon is hid in her heaven above,
      And the waves climb high and fast.
  Oh! kiss me, kiss me, once again,
      Lest thy kiss should be the last.
      Oh kiss me ere we part;
      Grow closer to my heart.
  My heart is warmer surely than the bosom of the main.

  Oh joy! O bliss of blisses!
      My heart of hearts art thou.
  Come bathe me with thy kisses,
      My eyelids and my brow.
  Hark how the wild rain hisses,
      And the loud sea roars below.

  Thy heart beats through thy rosy limbs
      So gladly doth it stir;
  Thine eye in drops of gladness swims.
      I have bathed thee with the pleasant myrrh;
  Thy locks are dripping balm;
      Thou shalt not wander hence to-night,
  I'll stay thee with my kisses.
      To-night the roaring brine
  Will rend thy golden tresses;
      The ocean with the morrow light
  Will be both blue and calm;
      And the billow will embrace thee with a kiss as soft as mine.

  No western odours wander
      On the black and moaning sea,
  And when thou art dead, Leander,
      My soul shall follow thee!
  Oh go not yet, my love,
      Thy voice is sweet and low;
  The deep salt wave breaks in above
      Those marble steps below.
  The turretstairs are wet
      That lead into the sea.
  Leander! go not yet.
  The pleasant stars have set!
  Oh! go not, go not yet,
      Or I will follow thee.

=The Mystic=

  Angels have talked with him, and showed him thrones:
  Ye knew him not: he was not one of ye,
  Ye scorned him with an undiscerning scorn:
  Ye could not read the marvel in his eye,
  The still serene abstraction; he hath felt
  The vanities of after and before;
  Albeit, his spirit and his secret heart
  The stern experiences of converse lives,
  The linked woes of many a fiery change
  Had purified, and chastened, and made free.
  Always there stood before him, night and day,
  Of wayward vary coloured circumstance,
  The imperishable presences serene,
  Colossal, without form, or sense, or sound,
  Dim shadows but unwaning presences
  Fourfaced to four corners of the sky;
  And yet again, three shadows, fronting one,
  One forward, one respectant, three but one;
  And yet again, again and evermore,
  For the two first were not, but only seemed
  One shadow in the midst of a great light,
  One reflex from eternity on time,
  One mighty countenance of perfect calm,
  Awful with most invariable eyes.
  For him the silent congregated hours,
  Daughters of time, divinely tall, beneath
  Severe and youthful brows, with shining eyes
  Smiling a godlike smile (the innocent light
  Of earliest youth pierced through and through with all
  Keen knowledges of low-embowed eld)
  Upheld, and ever hold aloft the cloud
  Which droops low hung on either gate of life,
  Both birth and death; he in the centre fixed,
  Saw far on each side through the grated gates
  Most pale and clear and lovely distances.
  He often lying broad awake, and yet
  Remaining from the body, and apart
  In intellect and power and will, hath heard
  Time flowing in the middle of the night,
  And all things creeping to a day of doom.
  How could ye know him? Ye were yet within
  The narrower circle; he had well nigh reached
  The last, with which a region of white flame,
  Pure without heat, into a larger air
  Upburning, and an ether of black hue,
  Investeth and ingirds all other lives.

=The Grasshopper=

  I

  Voice of the summerwind,
      Joy of the summerplain,
      Life of the summerhours,
    Carol clearly, bound along.
      No Tithon thou as poets feign
  (Shame fall 'em they are deaf and blind)
    But an insect lithe and strong,
      Bowing the seeded summerflowers.
  Prove their falsehood and thy quarrel,
      Vaulting on thine airy feet.
  Clap thy shielded sides and carol,
      Carol clearly, chirrup sweet
  Thou art a mailed warrior in youth and strength complete;
      Armed cap-a-pie,
      Full fair to see;
        Unknowing fear,
      Undreading loss,
        A gallant cavalier
  _Sans peur et sans reproche_,
      In sunlight and in shadow,
      The Bayard of the meadow.

  II

  I would dwell with thee,
      Merry grasshopper,
  Thou art so glad and free,
      And as light as air;
  Thou hast no sorrow or tears,
  Thou hast no compt of years,
  No withered immortality,
  But a short youth sunny and free.
  Carol clearly, bound along,
      Soon thy joy is over,
  A summer of loud song,
      And slumbers in the clover.
      What hast thou to do with evil
      In thine hour of love and revel,
      In thy heat of summerpride,
      Pushing the thick roots aside
      Of the singing flowered grasses,
      That brush thee with their silken tresses?
  What hast thou to do with evil,
  Shooting, singing, ever springing
      In and out the emerald glooms,
  Ever leaping, ever singing,
      Lighting on the golden blooms?




IX

=Love, Pride and Forgetfulness=

  Ere yet my heart was sweet Love's tomb,
  Love laboured honey busily.
  I was the hive and Love the bee,
  My heart the honey-comb.
  One very dark and chilly night
  Pride came beneath and held a light.

  The cruel vapours went through all,
  Sweet Love was withered in his cell;
  Pride took Love's sweets, and by a spell
  Did change them into gall;
  And Memory tho' fed by Pride
  Did wax so thin on gall,
  Awhile she scarcely lived at all,
  What marvel that she died?

=Chorus=

_In an unpublished drama written very early._

  The varied earth, the moving heaven,
      The rapid waste of roving sea,
  The fountainpregnant mountains riven
      To shapes of wildest anarchy,
  By secret fire and midnight storms
      That wander round their windy cones,
  The subtle life, the countless forms
      Of living things, the wondrous tones
  Of man and beast are full of strange
  Astonishment and boundless change.

  The day, the diamonded light,
      The echo, feeble child of sound,
  The heavy thunder's girding might,
      The herald lightning's starry bound,
  The vocal spring of bursting bloom,
      The naked summer's glowing birth,
  The troublous autumn's sallow gloom,
      The hoarhead winter paving earth
  With sheeny white, are full of strange
  Astonishment and boundless change.

  Each sun which from the centre flings
      Grand music and redundant fire,
  The burning belts, the mighty rings,
      The murmurous planets' rolling choir,
  The globefilled arch that, cleaving air,
      Lost in its effulgence sleeps,
  The lawless comets as they glare,
      And thunder thro' the sapphire deeps
  In wayward strength, are full of strange
  Astonishment and boundless change.




XI

=Lost Hope=

  You cast to ground the hope which once was mine,
      But did the while your harsh decree deplore,
  Embalming with sweet tears the vacant shrine,
      My heart, where Hope had been and was no more.

  So on an oaken sprout
      A goodly acorn grew;
  But winds from heaven shook the acorn out,
      And filled the cup with dew.




XII

=The Tears of Heaven=

  Heaven weeps above the earth all night till morn,
  In darkness weeps, as all ashamed to weep,
  Because the earth hath made her state forlorn
  With selfwrought evils of unnumbered years,
  And doth the fruit of her dishonour reap.
  And all the day heaven gathers back her tears
  Into her own blue eyes so clear and deep,
  And showering down the glory of lightsome day,
  Smiles on the earth's worn brow to win her if she may.




XIII

=Love and Sorrow=

  O maiden, fresher than the first green leaf
  With which the fearful springtide flecks the lea,
  Weep not, Almeida, that I said to thee
  That thou hast half my heart, for bitter grief
  Doth hold the other half in sovranty.
  Thou art my heart's sun in love's crystalline:
  Yet on both sides at once thou canst not shine:
  Thine is the bright side of my heart, and thine
  My heart's day, but the shadow of my heart,
  Issue of its own substance, my heart's night
  Thou canst not lighten even with _thy_ light,
  All powerful in beauty as thou art.
  Almeida, if my heart were substanceless,
  Then might thy rays pass thro' to the other side,
  So swiftly, that they nowhere would abide,
  But lose themselves in utter emptiness.
  Half-light, half-shadow, let my spirit sleep
  They never learnt to love who never knew to weep.




XIV

=To a Lady Sleeping=

  O thou whose fringed lids I gaze upon,
  Through whose dim brain the winged dreams are born,
  Unroof the shrines of clearest vision,
  In honour of the silverflecked morn:
  Long hath the white wave of the virgin light
  Driven back the billow of the dreamful dark.
  Thou all unwittingly prolongest night,
  Though long ago listening the poised lark,
  With eyes dropt downward through the blue serene,
  Over heaven's parapets the angels lean.




XV

=Sonnet=

  Could I outwear my present state of woe
  With one brief winter, and indue i' the spring
  Hues of fresh youth, and mightily outgrow
  The wan dark coil of faded suffering--
  Forth in the pride of beauty issuing
  A sheeny snake, the light of vernal bowers,
  Moving his crest to all sweet plots of flowers
  And watered vallies where the young birds sing;
  Could I thus hope my lost delights renewing,
  I straightly would commend the tears to creep
  From my charged lids; but inwardly I weep:
  Some vital heat as yet my heart is wooing:
  This to itself hath drawn the frozen rain
  From my cold eyes and melted it again.




XVI

=Sonnet=

  Though Night hath climbed her peak of highest noon,
  And bitter blasts the screaming autumn whirl,
  All night through archways of the bridged pearl
  And portals of pure silver walks the moon.
  Wake on, my soul, nor crouch to agony:
  Turn cloud to light, and bitterness to joy,
  And dross to gold with glorious alchemy,
  Basing thy throne above the world's annoy.
  Reign thou above the storms of sorrow and ruth
  That roar beneath; unshaken peace hath won thee:
  So shall thou pierce the woven glooms of truth;
  So shall the blessing of the meek be on thee;
  So in thine hour of dawn, the body's youth,
  An honourable eld shall come upon thee.




XVII

=Sonnet=

  Shall the hag Evil die with the child of Good,
  Or propagate again her loathed kind,
  Thronging the cells of the diseased mind,
  Hateful with hanging cheeks, a withered brood,
  Though hourly pastured on the salient blood?
  Oh! that the wind which bloweth cold or heat
  Would shatter and o'erbear the brazen beat
  Of their broad vans, and in the solitude
  Of middle space confound them, and blow back
  Their wild cries down their cavernthroats, and slake
  With points of blastborne hail their heated eyne!
  So their wan limbs no more might come between
  The moon and the moon's reflex in the night;
  Nor blot with floating shades the solar light.




XVIII

=Sonnet=

  The palid thunderstricken sigh for gain,
  Down an ideal stream they ever float,
  And sailing on Pactolus in a boat,
  Drown soul and sense, while wistfully they strain
  Weak eyes upon the glistering sands that robe
  The understream. The wise could he behold
  Cathedralled caverns of thick-ribbed gold
  And branching silvers of the central globe,
  Would marvel from so beautiful a sight
  How scorn and ruin, pain and hate could flow:
  But Hatred in a gold cave sits below,
  Pleached with her hair, in mail of argent light
  Shot into gold, a snake her forehead clips
  And skins the colour from her trembling lips.




XIX

=Love=

  I

  Thou, from the first, unborn, undying love,
  Albeit we gaze not on thy glories near,
  Before the face of God didst breath and move,
  Though night and pain and ruin and death reign here.
  Thou foldest, like a golden atmosphere,
  The very throne of the eternal God:
  Passing through thee the edicts of his fear
  Are mellowed into music, borne abroad
  By the loud winds, though they uprend the sea,
  Even from his central deeps: thine empery
  Is over all: thou wilt not brook eclipse;
  Thou goest and returnest to His Lips
  Like lightning: thou dost ever brood above
  The silence of all hearts, unutterable Love.

  II

  To know thee is all wisdom, and old age
  Is but to know thee: dimly we behold thee
  Athwart the veils of evil which enfold thee
  We beat upon our aching hearts with rage;
  We cry for thee: we deem the world thy tomb.
  As dwellers in lone planets look upon
  The mighty disk of their majestic sun,
  Hallowed in awful chasms of wheeling gloom,
  Making their day dim, so we gaze on thee.
  Come, thou of many crowns, white-robed love,
  Oh! rend the veil in twain: all men adore thee;
  Heaven crieth after thee; earth waileth for thee:
  Breathe on thy winged throne, and it shall move
  In music and in light o'er land and sea.

  III

  And now--methinks I gaze upon thee now,
  As on a serpent in his agonies
  Awestricken Indians; what time laid low
  And crushing the thick fragrant reeds he lies,
  When the new year warm breathed on the earth,
  Waiting to light him with his purple skies,
  Calls to him by the fountain to uprise.
  Already with the pangs of a new birth
  Strain the hot spheres of his convulsed eyes,
  And in his writhings awful hues begin
  To wander down his sable sheeny sides,
  Like light on troubled waters: from within
  Anon he rusheth forth with merry din,
  And in him light and joy and strength abides;
  And from his brows a crown of living light
  Looks through the thickstemmed woods by day and night




XX

=English War Song=

      Who fears to die? Who fears to die?
      Is there any here who fears to die
  He shall find what he fears, and none shall grieve
      For the man who fears to die:
  But the withering scorn of the many shall cleave
      To the man who fears to die.

  _Chorus_.--Shout for England!
                  Ho! for England!
                  George for England!
                  Merry England!
                  England for aye!

  The hollow at heart shall crouch forlorn,
  He shall eat the bread of common scorn;
      It shall be steeped in the salt, salt tear,
      Shall be steeped in his own salt tear:
  Far better, far better he never were born
      Than to shame merry England here.

  _Chorus_.--Shout for England! etc.

  There standeth our ancient enemy;
  Hark! he shouteth--the ancient enemy!
      On the ridge of the hill his banners rise;
      They stream like fire in the skies;
  Hold up the Lion of England on high
      Till it dazzle and blind his eyes.

      _Chorus_.--Shout for England! etc.

  Come along! we alone of the earth are free;
  The child in our cradles is bolder than he;
      For where is the heart and strength of slaves?
      Oh! where is the strength of slaves?
  He is weak! we are strong; he a slave, we are free;
      Come along! we will dig their graves.

      _Chorus_.--Shout for England! etc.

  There standeth our ancient enemy;
  Will he dare to battle with the free?
      Spur along! spur amain! charge to the fight:
      Charge! charge to the fight!
  Hold up the Lion of England on high!
      Shout for God and our right!

      _Chorus_.--Shout for England! etc.

=National Song=

  There is no land like England
    Where'er the light of day be;
  There are no hearts like English hearts,
    Such hearts of oak as they be.
  There is no land like England
    Where'er the light of day be;
  There are no men like Englishmen,
    So tall and bold as they be.

  _Chorus_.--For the French the Pope may shrive 'em,
                  For the devil a whit we heed 'em,
                  As for the French, God speed 'em
                    Unto their hearts' desire,
                  And the merry devil drive 'em
                    Through the water and the fire.

  _Chorus_.--Our glory is our freedom,
                    We lord it o'er the sea;
                  We are the sons of freedom,
                    We are free.

  There is no land like England,
    Where'er the light of day be;
  There are no wives like English wives,
    So fair and chaste as they be.
  There is no land like England,
    Where'er the light of day be,
  There are no maids like English maids,
    So beautiful as they be.

  _Chorus_.--For the French, etc.

[Sixty years after first publication this Song was incorporated in
'The Foresters' (published 1892) as the opening chorus of the second
act. The two verses were unaltered, but the two choruses were
re-written.]

=Dualisms=

  Two bees within a chrystal flowerbell rocked
  Hum a lovelay to the westwind at noontide.
  Both alike, they buzz together,
  Both alike, they hum together
  Through and through the flowered heather.

  Where in a creeping cove the wave unshocked
    Lays itself calm and wide,
  Over a stream two birds of glancing feather
  Do woo each other, carolling together.
  Both alike, they glide together
    Side by side;
  Both alike, they sing together,
  Arching blue-glossed necks beneath the purple weather.

  Two children lovelier than love, adown the lea are singing,
  As they gambol, lilygarlands ever stringing:
  Both in blosmwhite silk are frocked:
  Like, unlike, they roam together
  Under a summervault of golden weather;
  Like, unlike, they sing together
    Side by side;
  Mid May's darling goldenlocked,
  Summer's tanling diamondeyed.




XXIII

[Greek: ohi rheontes]

  I

  All thoughts, all creeds, all dreams are true,
    All visions wild and strange;
  Man is the measure of all truth
    Unto himself. All truth is change:
  All men do walk in sleep, and all
    Have faith in that they dream:
  For all things are as they seem to all,
    And all things flow like a stream.

  II

  There is no rest, no calm, no pause,
    Nor good nor ill, nor light nor shade,
  Nor essence nor eternal laws:
    For nothing is, but all is made,
  But if I dream that all these are,
    They are to me for that I dream;
  For all things are as they seem to all,
    And all things flow like a stream.


Argal.--This very opinion is only true relatively to the flowing
philosophers. (Tennyson's note.)

=Song=

  I

  The lintwhite and the throstlecock
      Have voices sweet and clear;
    All in the bloomed May.
  They from the blosmy brere
  Call to the fleeting year,
  If that he would them hear
      And stay.
  Alas! that one so beautiful
    Should have so dull an ear.

  II

  Fair year, fair year, thy children call,
      But thou art deaf as death;
    All in the bloomed May.
  When thy light perisheth
  That from thee issueth,
  Our life evanisheth:
      Oh! stay.
  Alas! that lips so cruel dumb
    Should have so sweet a breath!

  III

  Fair year, with brows of royal love
      Thou comest, as a King.
    All in the bloomed May.
  Thy golden largess fling,
  And longer hear us sing;
  Though thou art fleet of wing,
      Yet stay.
  Alas! that eyes so full of light
  Should be so wandering!

  IV

  Thy locks are full of sunny sheen
      In rings of gold yronne,[C]
    All in the bloomed May,
  We pri' thee pass not on;
  If thou dost leave the sun,
  Delight is with thee gone,
      Oh! stay.
  Thou art the fairest of thy feres,
    We pri' thee pass not on.

[Footnote C: His crispe hair in ringis was yronne.--Chaucer, _Knight's
Tale_. (Tennyson's note.)]

=A Fragment=

[Published in _The Gem: a Literary Annual_. London: W. Marshall,
Holborn Bars, mdcccxxxi.]

  Where is the Giant of the Sun, which stood
  In the midnoon the glory of old Rhodes,
  A perfect Idol, with profulgent brows
  Far sheening down the purple seas to those
  Who sailed from Mizraim underneath the star
  Named of the Dragon--and between whose limbs
  Of brassy vastness broad-blown Argosies
  Drave into haven? Yet endure unscathed
  Of changeful cycles the great Pyramids
  Broad-based amid the fleeting sands, and sloped
  Into the slumberous summer noon; but where,
  Mysterious Egypt, are thine obelisks
  Graven with gorgeous emblems undiscerned?
  Thy placid Sphinxes brooding o'er the Nile?
  Thy shadowy Idols in the solitudes,
  Awful Memnonian countenances calm
  Looking athwart the burning flats, far off
  Seen by the high-necked camel on the verge
  Journeying southward? Where are thy monuments
  Piled by the strong and sunborn Anakim
  Over their crowned brethren [Greek: ON] and [Greek: ORE]?
  Thy Memnon, when his peaceful lips are kissed
  With earliest rays, that from his mother's eyes
  Flow over the Arabian bay, no more
  Breathes low into the charmed ears of morn
  Clear melody flattering the crisped Nile
  By columned Thebes. Old Memphis hath gone down:
  The Pharaohs are no more: somewhere in death
  They sleep with staring eyes and gilded lips,
  Wrapped round with spiced cerements in old grots
  Rock-hewn and sealed for ever.

  With roses musky breathed,
  And drooping daffodilly,
  And silverleaved lily,
  And ivy darkly-wreathed,
  I wove a crown before her,
  For her I love so dearly,
  A garland for Lenora.
  With a silken cord I bound it.
  Lenora, laughing clearly
  A light and thrilling laughter,
  About her forehead wound it,
  And loved me ever after.

[Published in _The Gem: a Literary Annual_. London: W. Marshall,

      O sad _No more!_ O sweet _No more!_
                O strange _No more!_
      By a mossed brookbank on a stone
      I smelt a wildweed flower alone;
      There was a ringing in my ears,
      And both my eyes gushed out with tears.
  Surely all pleasant things had gone before,
  Low-buried fathom deep beneath with thee,
                NO MORE!

  Check every outflash, every ruder sally
    Of thought and speech; speak low, and give up wholly
    Thy spirit to mild-minded Melancholy;
  This is the place. Through yonder poplar alley
  Below, the blue-green river windeth slowly;
    But in the middle of the sombre valley
    The crisped waters whisper musically,
  And all the haunted place is dark and holy.
  The nightingale, with long and low preamble,
    Warbled from yonder knoll of solemn larches,
    And in and out the woodbine's flowery arches
  The summer midges wove their wanton gambol,
    And all the white-stemmed pinewood slept above--
    When in this valley first I told my love.

=Sonnet=

[Published in _Friendships Offering: a Literary Album_ for 1832.
London: Smith and Elder.]

  Me my own fate to lasting sorrow doometh:
    Thy woes are birds of passage, transitory:
    Thy spirit, circled with a living glory,
  In summer still a summer joy resumeth.
  Alone my hopeless melancholy gloometh,
    Like a lone cypress, through the twilight hoary,
  From an old garden where no flower bloometh,
    One cypress on an inland promontory.
  But yet my lonely spirit follows thine,
    As round the rolling earth night follows day:
  But yet thy lights on my horizon shine
    Into my night when thou art far away;
  I am so dark, alas! and thou so bright,
  When we two meet there's never perfect light.

=Sonnet=

[Published in the _Yorkshire Literary Annual_ for 1832. Edited by C.F.
Edgar, London: Longman and Co. Reprinted in the _Athenaeum_, 4 May,
1867.]

  There are three things that fill my heart with sighs
  And steep my soul in laughter (when I view
  Fair maiden forms moving like melodies),
  Dimples, roselips, and eyes of any hue.

  There are three things beneath the blessed skies
  For which I live--black eyes, and brown and blue;
  I hold them all most dear; but oh! black eyes,
  I live and die, and only die for you.

  Of late such eyes looked at me--while I mused
  At sunset, underneath a shadowy plane
  In old Bayona, nigh the Southern Sea--
  From an half-open lattice looked at _me_.

  I saw no more only those eyes--confused
  And dazzled to the heart with glorious pain.




=Poems, 1833=


[The poems numbered XXXI-XXXIX were published in the 1832 volume
(_Poems by Alfred Tennyson_. London: Edward Moxon, 94 New Bond Street.
MDCCCXXXIII; published December, 1832), and were thereafter
suppressed.]

=Sonnet=

  Oh, Beauty, passing beauty! sweetest Sweet!
    How canst thou let me waste my youth in sighs;
  I only ask to sit beside thy feet.
    Thou knowest I dare not look into thine eyes,
  Might I but kiss thy hand! I dare not fold
    My arms about thee--scarcely dare to speak.
  And nothing seems to me so wild and bold,
    As with one kiss to touch thy blessed cheek.
  Methinks if I should kiss thee, no control
    Within the thrilling brain could keep afloat
    The subtle spirit. Even while I spoke,
  The bare word KISS hath made my inner soul
    To tremble like a lutestring, ere the note
    Hath melted in the silence that it broke.

=The Hesperides=

    Hesperus and his daughters three
    That sing about the golden tree.
      --COMUS.

  The Northwind fall'n, in the newstarred night
  Zidonian Hanno, voyaging beyond
  The hoary promontory of Soloe
  Past Thymiaterion, in calmed bays,
  Between the Southern and the Western Horn,
  Heard neither warbling of the nightingale,
  Nor melody o' the Lybian lotusflute
  Blown seaward from the shore; but from a slope
  That ran bloombright into the Atlantic blue,
  Beneath a highland leaning down a weight
  Of cliffs, and zoned below with cedarshade,
  Came voices, like the voices in a dream,
  Continuous till he reached the other sea.


_Song_

  I

  The golden apple, the golden apple, the hallowed fruit,
  Guard it well, guard it warily,
  Singing airily,
  Standing about the charmed root.
  Round about all is mute,
  As the snowfield on the mountain-peaks,
  As the sandfield at the mountain-foot.
  Crocodiles in briny creeks
  Sleep and stir not: all is mute.
  If ye sing not, if ye make false measure,
  We shall lose eternal pleasure,
  Worth eternal want of rest.
  Laugh not loudly: watch the treasure
  Of the wisdom of the West.
  In a corner wisdom whispers. Five and three
  (Let it not be preached abroad) make an awful mystery.
  For the blossom unto three-fold music bloweth;
  Evermore it is born anew;
  And the sap to three-fold music floweth,
  From the root
  Drawn in the dark,
  Up to the fruit,
  Creeping under the fragrant bark,
  Liquid gold, honeysweet thro' and thro'.
  Keen-eyed Sisters, singing airily,
  Looking warily
  Every way,
  Guard the apple night and day,
  Lest one from the East come and take it away.

  II

  Father Hesper, Father Hesper, watch, watch, ever and aye,
  Looking under silver hair with a silver eye.
  Father, twinkle not thy stedfast sight;
  Kingdoms lapse, and climates change, and races die;
  Honour comes with mystery;
  Hoarded wisdom brings delight.
  Number, tell them over and number
  How many the mystic fruit-tree holds,
  Lest the redcombed dragon slumber
  Rolled together in purple folds.
  Look to him, father, lest he wink, and the golden apple be stol'n away,
  For his ancient heart is drunk with overwatchings night and day,
  Round about the hallowed fruit tree curled--
  Sing away, sing aloud and evermore in the wind, without stop,
  Lest his scaled eyelid drop,
  For he is older than the world.
  If he waken, we waken,
  Rapidly levelling eager eyes.
  If he sleep, we sleep,
  Dropping the eyelid over the eyes.
  If the golden apple be taken
  The world will be overwise.
  Five links, a golden chain, are we,
  Hesper, the dragon, and sisters three,
  Bound about the golden tree.

  III

  Father Hesper, Father Hesper, watch, watch, night and day,
  Lest the old wound of the world be healed,
  The glory unsealed,
  The golden apple stol'n away,
  And the ancient secret revealed.
  Look from west to east along:
  Father, old Himla weakens, Caucasus is bold and strong.
  Wandering waters unto wandering waters call;
  Let them clash together, foam and fall.
  Out of watchings, out of wiles,
  Comes the bliss of secret smiles,
  All things are not told to all,
  Half round the mantling night is drawn,
  Purplefringed with even and dawn.
  Hesper hateth Phosphor, evening hateth morn.

  IV

  Every flower and every fruit the redolent breath
  Of this warm seawind ripeneth,
  Arching the billow in his sleep;
  But the land-wind wandereth,
  Broken by the highland-steep,
  Two streams upon the violet deep:
  For the western sun and the western star,
  And the low west wind, breathing afar,
  The end of day and beginning of night
  Make the apple holy and bright,
  Holy and bright, round and full, bright and blest,
  Mellowed in a land of rest;
  Watch it warily day and night;
  All good things are in the west,
  Till midnoon the cool east light
  Is shut out by the round of the tall hillbrow;
  But when the fullfaced sunset yellowly
  Stays on the flowering arch of the bough,
  The luscious fruitage clustereth mellowly,
  Goldenkernelled, goldencored,
  Sunset ripened, above on the tree,
  The world is wasted with fire and sword,
  But the apple of gold hangs over the sea,
  Five links, a golden chain, are we,
  Hesper, the dragon, and sisters three,
      Daughters three,
      Bound about
      All round about
  The gnarled bole of the charmed tree,
  The golden apple, the golden apple, the hallowed fruit,
  Guard it well, guard it warily,
      Watch it warily,
      Singing airily,
  Standing about the charmed root.




XXXIII

=Rosalind=

    My Rosalind, my Rosalind,
  Bold, subtle, careless Rosalind,
  Is one of those who know no strife
  Of inward woe or outward fear;
  To whom the slope and stream of life,
  The life before, the life behind,
  In the ear, from far and near,
  Chimeth musically clear.
  My falconhearted Rosalind
  Fullsailed before a vigorous wind,
  Is one of those who cannot weep
  For others' woes, but overleap
  All the petty shocks and fears
  That trouble life in early years,
  With a flash of frolic scorn
  And keen delight, that never falls
  Away from freshness, self-upborne
  With such gladness, as, whenever
  The freshflushing springtime calls
  To the flooding waters cool,
  Young fishes, on an April morn,
  Up and down a rapid river,
  Leap the little waterfalls
  That sing into the pebbled pool.
  My happy falcon, Rosalind,
  Hath daring fancies of her own,
  Fresh as the dawn before the day,
  Fresh as the early seasmell blown
  Through vineyards from an inland bay.
  My Rosalind, my Rosalind,
  Because no shadow on you falls,
  Think you hearts are tennis balls
  To play with, wanton Rosalind?




XXXIV

=Song=

  Who can say
  Why To-day
  To-morrow will be yesterday?
  Who can tell
  Why to smell
  The violet, recalls the dewy prime
  Of youth and buried time?
  The cause is nowhere found in rhyme.




XXXV

=Sonnet=

_Written on hearing of the outbreak of the Polish Insurrection._

  Blow ye the trumpet, gather from afar
    The hosts to battle: be not bought and sold.
    Arise, brave Poles, the boldest of the bold;
  Break through your iron shackles--fling them far.
  O for those days of Piast, ere the Czar
    Grew to this strength among his deserts cold;
    When even to Moscow's cupolas were rolled
  The growing murmurs of the Polish war!
  Now must your noble anger blaze out more
    Than when from Sobieski, clan by clan,
  The Moslem myriads fell, and fled before--
    Than when Zamoysky smote the Tartar Khan,
  Than earlier, when on the Baltic shore
    Boleslas drove the Pomeranian.




XXXVI

=O Darling Room=[D]

  I

  O darling room, my heart's delight,
  Dear room, the apple of my sight,
  With thy two couches soft and white,
  There is no room so exquisite,
  No little room so warm and bright
  Wherein to read, wherein to write.

  II

  For I the Nonnenwerth have seen,
  And Oberwinter's vineyards green,
  Musical Lurlei; and between
  The hills to Bingen have I been,
  Bingen in Darmstadt, where the Rhene
  Curves towards Mentz, a woody scene.

  III

  Yet never did there meet my sight,
  In any town, to left or right,
  A little room so exquisite,
  With two such couches soft and white;
  Not any room so warm and bright,
  Wherein to read, wherein to write.

[Footnote D: 'As soon as this poem was published, I altered the second
line to "All books and pictures ranged aright"; yet "Dear room, the
apple of my sight" (which was much abused) is not as bad as "Do go,
dear rain, do go away."' [Note initialed 'A.T.' in _Life_, vol. I, p.
89.] The worthlessness of much of the criticism lavished on Tennyson
by his coterie of adulating friends may be judged from the fact that
Arthur Hallam wrote to Tennyson that this poem was 'mighty
pleasant.']




XXXVII

=To Christopher North=

  You did late review my lays,
    Crusty Christopher;
  You did mingle blame and praise,
    Rusty Christopher.
  When I learnt from whom it came,
  I forgave you all the blame,
    Musty Christopher;
  I could _not_ forgive the praise,
    Fusty Christopher.

[This epigram was Tennyson's reply to an article by Professor
Wilson--'Christopher North'--in _Blackwood's Magazine_ for May 1832,
dealing in sensible fashion with Tennyson's 1830 volume, and
ridiculing the fulsome praise lavished on him by his inconsiderate
friends--especially referring to Arthur Hallam's article in the
_Englishman's Magazine_ for August, 1831.]




XXXVIII

=The Lotos-Eaters=

[These forty lines formed the conclusion to the original (1833)
version of the poem. When the poem was reprinted in the 1842 volumes
these lines were suppressed.]

  We have had enough of motion,
  Weariness and wild alarm,
  Tossing on the tossing ocean,
  Where the tusked seahorse walloweth
  In a stripe of grassgreen calm,
  At noon-tide beneath the lea;
  And the monstrous narwhale swalloweth
  His foamfountains in the sea.
  Long enough the winedark wave our weary bark did carry.
  This is lovelier and sweeter,
  Men of Ithaca, this is meeter,
  In the hollow rosy vale to tarry,
  Like a dreamy Lotos-eater, a delirious Lotos-eater!
  We will eat the Lotos, sweet
  As the yellow honeycomb,
  In the valley some, and some
  On the ancient heights divine;
  And no more roam,
  On the loud hoar foam,
  To the melancholy home
  At the limit of the brine,
  The little isle of Ithaca, beneath the day's decline.
  We'll lift no more the shattered oar,
  No more unfurl the straining sail;
  With the blissful Lotos-eaters pale
  We will abide in the golden vale
  Of the Lotos-land, till the Lotos fail;
  We will not wander more.
  Hark! how sweet the horned ewes bleat
  On the solitary steeps,
  And the merry lizard leaps,
  And the foam-white waters pour;
  And the dark pine weeps,
  And the lithe vine creeps,
  And the heavy melon sleeps
  On the level of the shore:
  Oh! islanders of Ithaca, we will not wander more,
  Surely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore
  Than labour in the ocean, and rowing with the oar,
  Oh! islanders of Ithaca, we will return no more.




XXXIX

=A Dream of Fair Women=

[In the 1833 volume the poem opened with the following four verses,
suppressed after 1842. These Fitz Gerald considered made 'a perfect
poem by themselves.']

  As when a man, that sails in a balloon,
    Downlooking sees the solid shining ground
  Stream from beneath him in the broad blue noon,
    Tilth, hamlet, mead and mound:

  And takes his flags and waves them to the mob
    That shout below, all faces turned to where
  Glows rubylike the far-up crimson globe,
    Filled with a finer air:

  So, lifted high, the poet at his will
    Lets the great world flit from him, seeing all,
  Higher thro' secret splendours mounting still,
    Self-poised, nor fears to fall.

  Hearing apart the echoes of his fame.
    While I spoke thus, the seedsman, Memory,
  Sowed my deep-furrowed thought with many a name
    Whose glory will not die.

=Cambridge=

[This poem is written in pencil on the fly-leaf of a copy of _Poems_
1833 in the Dyce Collection in South Kensington Museum. Reprinted with
many alterations in _Life_, vol. I, p. 67.]

  Therefore your halls, your ancient colleges,
    Your portals statued with old kings and queens,
  Your bridges and your busted libraries,
    Wax-lighted chapels and rich carved screens,
    Your doctors and your proctors and your deans
  Shall not avail you when the day-beam sports
    New-risen o'er awakened Albion--No,
    Nor yet your solemn organ-pipes that blow
  Melodious thunders through your vacant courts
  At morn and even; for your manner sorts
    Not with this age, nor with the thoughts that roll,
  Because the words of little children preach
  Against you,--ye that did profess to teach
    And have taught nothing, feeding on the soul.

=The Germ of 'Maud'=

[There was published in 1837 in _The Tribute_, (a collection of
original poems by various authors, edited by Lord Northampton), a
contribution by Tennyson entitled 'Stanzas,' consisting of xvi stanzas
of varying lengths (110 lines in all). In 1855 the first xii stanzas
were published as the fourth section of the second part of 'Maud.'
Some verbal changes and transpositions of lines were made; a new
stanza (the present sixth) and several new lines were introduced, and
the xth stanza of 1837 became the xiiith of 1855. But stanzas xiii-xvi
of 1837 have never been reprinted in any edition of Tennyson's works,
though quoted in whole or part in various critical studies of the
poet. Swinburne refers to this poem as 'the poem of deepest charm and
fullest delight of pathos and melody ever written, even by Mr
Tennyson.' This poem in _The Tribute_ gained Tennyson his first notice
in the _Edinburgh Review_, which had till then ignored him.]

  XIII

  But she tarries in her place
  And I paint the beauteous face
      Of the maiden, that I lost,
          In my inner eyes again,
  Lest my heart be overborne,
  By the thing I hold in scorn,
      By a dull mechanic ghost
          And a juggle of the brain.

  XIV

  I can shadow forth my bride
      As I knew her fair and kind
          As I woo'd her for my wife;
  She is lovely by my side
      In the silence of my life--
          'Tis a phantom of the mind.

  XV

  'Tis a phantom fair and good
      I can call it to my side,
          So to guard my life from ill,
      Tho' its ghastly sister glide
          And be moved around me still
  With the moving of the blood
      That is moved not of the will.

  XVI

  Let it pass, the dreary brow,
      Let the dismal face go by,
  Will it lead me to the grave?
      Then I lose it: it will fly:
  Can it overlast the nerves?
      Can it overlive the eye?
  But the other, like a star,
  Thro' the channel windeth far
      Till it fade and fail and die,
  To its Archetype that waits
  Clad in light by golden gates,
  Clad in light the Spirit waits
      To embrace me in the sky.




XLII

[On the fly-leaf of a book illustrated by Bewick, in the library of
the late Lord Ravensworth, the following lines in Tennyson's autograph
were discovered in 1903.]

  A gate and a field half ploughed,
  A solitary cow,
  A child with a broken slate,
  And a titmarsh in the bough.
  But where, alack, is Bewick
  To tell the meaning now?




XLIII

=The Skipping-Rope=

[This poem, published in the second volume of _Poems by Alfred
Tennyson_ (in two volumes, London, Edward Moxon, MDCCCXLII), was
reprinted in every edition until 1851, when it was suppressed.]

  Sure never yet was Antelope
    Could skip so lightly by.
  Stand off, or else my skipping-rope
    Will hit you in the eye.
  How lightly whirls the skipping-rope!
    How fairy-like you fly!
  Go, get you gone, you muse and mope--
    I hate that silly sigh.
  Nay, dearest, teach me how to hope,
    Or tell me how to die.
  There, take it, take my skipping-rope
    And hang yourself thereby.




XLIV

=The New Timon and the Poets=

[From _Punch_, February 28, 1846. Bulwer Lytton published in 1845 his
satirical poem 'New Timon: a Romance of London,' in which he bitterly
attacked Tennyson for the civil list pension granted the previous
year, particularly referring to the poem 'O Darling Room' in the 1833
volume. Tennyson replied in the following vigorous verses, which made
the literary sensation of the year. Tennyson afterwards declared: 'I
never sent my lines to _Punch_. John Forster did. They were too
bitter. I do not think that I should ever have published
them.'--_Life_, vol. I, p. 245.]

  We know him, out of Shakespeare's art,
    And those fine curses which he spoke;
  The old Timon, with his noble heart,
    That, strongly loathing, greatly broke.

  So died the Old: here comes the New:
    Regard him: a familiar face:
  I _thought_ we knew him: What, it's you
    The padded man--that wears the stays--

  Who killed the girls and thrill'd the boys
    With dandy pathos when you wrote,
  A Lion, you, that made a noise,
    And shook a mane en papillotes.

  And once you tried the Muses too:
    You fail'd, Sir: therefore now you turn,
  You fall on those who are to you
    As captain is to subaltern.

  But men of long enduring hopes,
    And careless what this hour may bring,
  Can pardon little would-be Popes
    And Brummels, when they try to sting.

  An artist, Sir, should rest in art,
    And wave a little of his claim;
  To have the deep poetic heart
    Is more than all poetic fame.

  But you, Sir, you are hard to please;
    You never look but half content:
  Nor like a gentleman at ease
    With moral breadth of temperament.

  And what with spites and what with fears,
    You cannot let a body be:
  It's always ringing in your ears,
    'They call this man as good as _me_.'

  What profits now to understand
    The merits of a spotless shirt--
  A dapper boot--a little hand--
    If half the little soul is dirt?

  _You_ talk of tinsel! why we see
    The old mark of rouge upon your cheeks.
  _You_ prate of nature! you are he
  That spilt his life about the cliques.

  A Timon you! Nay, nay, for shame:
    It looks too arrogant a jest--
  The fierce old man--to take _his_ name
  You bandbox. Off, and let him rest.

=Mablethorpe=

[Published in _Manchester Athaenaum Album_, 1850. Written, 1837.
Republished, altered, in _Life_, vol. I, p. 161.]

  How often, when a child I lay reclined,
    I took delight in this locality!
  Here stood the infant Ilion of the mind,
    And here the Grecian ships did seem to be.

  And here again I come and only find
    The drain-cut levels of the marshy lea,--
  Gray sand banks and pale sunsets--dreary wind,
    Dim shores, dense rains, and heavy clouded sea.




XLVI

[Published in _The Keepsake for 1851: an illustrated annual_, edited
by Miss Power. London: David Bogue. To this issue of the Keepsake
Tennyson also contributed 'Come not when I am dead' now included in
the collected Works.]

  What time I wasted youthful hours
  One of the shining winged powers,
  Show'd me vast cliffs with crown of towers,

  As towards the gracious light I bow'd,
  They seem'd high palaces and proud,
  Hid now and then with sliding cloud.

  He said, 'The labour is not small;
  Yet winds the pathway free to all:--
  Take care thou dost not fear to fall!'

=Britons, Guard your Own=

[Published in _The Examiner_, January 31, 1852. Verses 1 (considerably
altered), 7, 8 and 10, are reprinted in Life, vol. I, p. 344.]

  Rise, Britons, rise, if manhood be not dead;
  The world's last tempest darkens overhead;
          The Pope has bless'd him;
          The Church caress'd him;
  He triumphs; maybe, we shall stand alone:
          Britons, guard your own.

  His ruthless host is bought with plunder'd gold,
  By lying priest's the peasant's votes controlled.
          All freedom vanish'd,
          The true men banished,
  He triumphs; maybe, we shall stand alone.
          Britons, guard your own.

  Peace-lovers we--sweet Peace we all desire--
  Peace-lovers we--but who can trust a liar?--
         Peace-lovers, haters
         Of shameless traitors,
  We hate not France, but this man's heart of stone.
          Britons, guard your own.

  We hate not France, but France has lost her voice
  This man is France, the man they call her choice.
          By tricks and spying,
          By craft and lying,
  And murder was her freedom overthrown.
          Britons, guard your own.

  'Vive l'Empereur' may follow by and bye;
  'God save the Queen' is here a truer cry.
          God save the Nation,
          The toleration,
  And the free speech that makes a Briton known.
          Britons, guard your own.

  Rome's dearest daughter now is captive France,
  The Jesuit laughs, and reckoning on his chance,
          Would, unrelenting,
          Kill all dissenting,
  Till we were left to fight for truth alone.
          Britons, guard your own.

  Call home your ships across Biscayan tides,
  To blow the battle from their oaken sides.
          Why waste they yonder
          Their idle thunder?
  Why stay they there to guard a foreign throne?
          Seamen, guard your own.

  We were the best of marksmen long ago,
  We won old battles with our strength, the bow.
          Now practise, yeomen,
          Like those bowmen,
  Till your balls fly as their true shafts have flown.
          Yeomen, guard your own.

  His soldier-ridden Highness might incline
  To take Sardinia, Belgium, or the Rhine:
         Shall we stand idle,
         Nor seek to bridle
  His vile aggressions, till we stand alone?
          Make their cause your own.

  Should he land here, and for one hour prevail,
  There must no man go back to bear the tale:
          No man to bear it--
          Swear it! We swear it!
  Although we fought the banded world alone,
          We swear to guard our own.

=Hands all Round=

[Published in _The Examiner_, February 7, 1852. Reprinted, slightly
altered, in Life, vol. I, p. 345. Included, almost entirely
re-written, in collected Works.]

  First drink a health, this solemn night,
    A health to England, every guest;
  That man's the best cosmopolite
    Who loves his native country best.
  May Freedom's oak for ever live
    With stronger life from day to day;
  That man's the best Conservative
    Who lops the mouldered branch away.
          Hands all round!
  God the tyrant's hope confound!
  To this great cause of Freedom drink, my friends,
    And the great name of England round and round.

  A health to Europe's honest men!
    Heaven guard them from her tyrants' jails!
  From wronged Poerio's noisome den,
    From iron limbs and tortured nails!
  We curse the crimes of Southern kings,
    The Russian whips and Austrian rods--
  We likewise have our evil things;
    Too much we make our Ledgers, Gods.
          Yet hands all round!
    God the tyrant's cause confound!
  To Europe's better health we drink, my friends,
    And the great name of England round and round.

  What health to France, if France be she
    Whom martial progress only charms?
  Yet tell her--better to be free
    Than vanquish all the world in arms.
  Her frantic city's flashing heats
    But fire, to blast the hopes of men.
  Why change the titles of your streets?
    You fools, you'll want them all again.
          Hands all round!
    God the tyrant's cause confound!
  To France, the wiser France, we drink, my friends,
    And the great name of England round and round.

  Gigantic daughter of the West,
    We drink to thee across the flood,
  We know thee most, we love thee best,
    For art thou not of British blood?
  Should war's mad blast again be blown,
    Permit not thou the tyrant powers
  To fight thy mother here alone,
    But let thy broadsides roar with ours.
          Hands all round!
    God the tyrant's cause confound!
  To our great kinsmen of the West, my friends,
    And the great name of England round and round.

  O rise, our strong Atlantic sons,
    When war against our freedom springs!
  O speak to Europe through your guns!
  They _can_ be understood by kings.
  You must not mix our Queen with those
    That wish to keep their people fools;
  Our freedom's foemen are her foes,
    She comprehends the race she rules.
          Hands all round!
    God the tyrant's cause confound!
  To our dear kinsmen of the West, my friends,
    And the great name of England round and round.

[Published in _The Examiner_, February 14, 1852, and never reprinted
nor acknowledged. The proof sheets of the poem, with alterations in
Tennyson's autograph, were offered for public sale in 1906.]

To the Editor of _The Examiner_.

SIR,--I have read with much interest the poems of Merlin. The enclosed
is longer than either of those, and certainly not so good: yet as I
flatter myself that it has a smack of Merlin's style in it, and as I
feel that it expresses forcibly enough some of the feelings of our
time, perhaps you may be induced to admit it.

TALIESSEN.


  How much I love this writer's manly style!
    By such men led, our press had ever been
  The public conscience of our noble isle,
    Severe and quick to feel a civic sin,
  To raise the people and chastise the times
  With such a heat as lives in great creative rhymes.

  O you, the Press! what good from you might spring!
    What power is yours to blast a cause or bless!
  I fear for you, as for some youthful king,
    Lest you go wrong from power in excess.
  Take heed of your wide privileges! we
  The thinking men of England, loathe a tyranny.

  A freeman is, I doubt not, freest here;
    The single voice may speak his mind aloud;
  An honest isolation need not fear
    The Court, the Church, the Parliament, the crowd.
  No, nor the Press! and look you well to that--
  We must not dread in you the nameless autocrat.

  And you, dark Senate of the public pen,
    You may not, like yon tyrant, deal in spies.
  Yours are the public acts of public men,
    But yours are not their household privacies.
  I grant you one of the great Powers on earth,
  But be not you the blatant traitors of the hearth.

  You hide the hand that writes: it must be so,
    For better so you fight for public ends;
  But some you strike can scarce return the blow;
    You should be all the nobler, O my friends.
  Be noble, you! nor work with faction's tools
    To charm a lower sphere of fulminating fools.

  But knowing all your power to heat or cool,
    To soothe a civic wound or keep it raw,
  Be loyal, if you wish for wholesome rule:
    Our ancient boast is this--we reverence law.
  We still were loyal in our wildest fights,
  Or loyally disloyal battled for our rights.

  O Grief and Shame if while I preach of laws
    Whereby to guard our Freedom from offence--
  And trust an ancient manhood and the cause
    Of England and her health of commonsense--
  There hang within the heavens a dark disgrace,
  Some vast Assyrian doom to burst upon our race.

  I feel the thousand cankers of our State,
    I fain would shake their triple-folded ease,
  The hogs who can believe in nothing great,
    Sneering bedridden in the down of Peace
  Over their scrips and shares, their meats and wine,
  With stony smirks at all things human and divine!

  I honour much, I say, this man's appeal.
    We drag so deep in our commercial mire,
  We move so far from greatness, that I feel
    Exception to be character'd in fire.
  Who looks for Godlike greatness here shall see
  The British Goddess, sleek Respectability.

  Alas for her and all her small delights!
    She feels not how the social frame is rack'd.
  She loves a little scandal which excites;
    A little feeling is a want of tact.
  For her there lie in wait millions of foes,
  And yet the 'not too much' is all the rule she knows.

  Poor soul! behold her: what decorous calm!
    She, with her week-day worldliness sufficed,
  Stands in her pew and hums her decent psalm
    With decent dippings at the name of Christ!
  And she has mov'd in that smooth way so long,
    She hardly can believe that she shall suffer wrong.

  Alas, our Church! alas, her growing ills,
    And those who tolerate not her tolerance,
  But needs must sell the burthen of their wills
    To that half-pagan harlot kept by France!
  Free subjects of the kindliest of all thrones,
  Headlong they plunge their doubts among old rags and bones.

  Alas, Church writers, altercating tribes--
    The vessel and your Church may sink in storms.
  Christ cried: Woe, woe, to Pharisees and Scribes!
    Like them, you bicker less for truth than forms.
  I sorrow when I read the things you write,
  What unheroic pertness! what un-Christian spite!

  Alas, our youth, so clever yet so small,
    Thin dilletanti deep in nature's plan,
  Who make the emphatic One, by whom is all,
    An essence less concentred than a man!
  Better wild Mahmoud's war-cry once again!
  O fools, we want a manlike God and Godlike men!

  Go, frightful omens. Yet once more I turn
    To you that mould men's thoughts; I call on you
  To make opinion warlike, lest we learn
    A sharper lesson than we ever knew.
  I hear a thunder though the skies are fair,
  But shrill you, loud and long, the warning-note:
      Prepare!

[Lord Tennyson wrote, by Royal request, two stanzas which were sung as
part of _God Save the Queen_ at a State concert in connection with the
Princess Royal's marriage: these were printed in the _Times_ of
January 26, 1858.]

  God bless our Prince and Bride!
  God keep their lands allied,
    God save the Queen!
  Clothe them with righteousness,
  Crown them with happiness,
  Them with all blessings bless,
    God save the Queen.

  Fair fall this hallow'd hour,
  Farewell our England's flower,
    God save the Queen!
  Farewell, fair rose of May!
  Let both the peoples say,
  God bless thy marriage-day,
    God bless the Queen.

[Published in _Enoch Arden_ volume (London: E. Moxon & Co, 1864) and
never reprinted.]

  'Your ringlets, your ringlets,
    That look so golden-gay,
  If you will give me one, but one,
    To kiss it night and day,
  Then never chilling touch of Time
    Will turn it silver-gray;
  And then shall I know it is all true gold
  To flame and sparkle and stream as of old,
  Till all the comets in heaven are cold,
    And all her stars decay.'
  'Then take it, love, and put it by;
  This cannot change, nor yet can I.'

  'My ringlet, my ringlet,
    That art so golden-gay,
  Now never chilling touch of Time
    Can turn thee silver-gray;
  And a lad may wink, and a girl may hint,
    And a fool may say his say;
  For my doubts and fears were all amiss,
  And I swear henceforth by this and this,
  That a doubt will only come for a kiss,
    And a fear to be kissed away.'
  'Then kiss it, love, and put it by:
  If this can change, why so can I.'

  O Ringlet, O Ringlet,
    I kiss'd you night and day,
  And Ringlet, O Ringlet,
    You still are golden-gay,
  But Ringlet, O Ringlet,
    You should be silver-gray:
  For what is this which now I'm told,
  I that took you for true gold,
  She that gave you's bought and sold,
          Sold, sold.

  O Ringlet, O Ringlet,
    She blush'd a rosy red,
  When Ringlet, O Ringlet,
    She clipt you from her head,
  And Ringlet, O Ringlet,
    She gave you me, and said,
  'Come, kiss it, love, and put it by:
  If this can change, why so can I.'
  O fie, you golden nothing, fie
          You golden lie.

  O Ringlet, O Ringlet,
    I count you much to blame,
  For Ringlet, O Ringlet,
    You put me much to shame,
  So Ringlet, O Ringlet,
    I doom you to the flame.
  For what is this which now I learn,
  Has given all my faith a turn?
  Burn, you glossy heretic, burn,
            Burn, burn.

=Song=

[This first form of the Song in _The Princess_ ('Home they brought her
warrior dead') was published only in _Selections from Tennyson_.
London: E. Moxon & Co, 1864.]

  Home they brought him slain with spears.
    They brought him home at even-fall:
  All alone she sits and hears
    Echoes in his empty hall,
      Sounding on the morrow.

  The Sun peeped in from open field,
    The boy began to leap and prance,
    Rode upon his father's lance,
  Beat upon his father's shield--
      'Oh hush, my joy, my sorrow.'

[Published in _Good Words_ for March 1, 1868 as a decorative page,
with an accompanying full page plate by T. Dalziel. The lines were
never reprinted.]

  I stood on a tower in the wet,
  And New Year and Old Year met,
  And winds were roaring and blowing;
  And I said, 'O years that meet in tears,
  Have ye aught that is worth the knowing?

  'Science enough and exploring
  Wanderers coming and going
  Matter enough for deploring
  But aught that is worth the knowing?'

  Seas at my feet were flowing
  Waves on the shingle pouring,
  Old Year roaring and blowing
  And New Year blowing and roaring.




=The Lover's Tale=
1833

[It was originally intended by Tennyson that this poem should
form part of his 1833 volume. It was put in type and, according to
custom, copies were distributed among his friends, when, on the eve of
publication, he decided to omit it. Again, in 1869, it was sent to
press with a new third part added, and was again withdrawn, the third
part only--'The Golden Supper,' founded on a story in Boccaccio's
_Decameron_--being published in the volume, 'The Holy Grail.' In 1866,
1870 and 1875, attempts had been made by Mr Herne Shepherd to publish
editions of 'The Lover's Tale,' reprinted from stray proof copies of
the 1833 printing. Each of these attempts was repressed by Tennyson,
and at last in 1879 the complete poem, as now included in the
collected Works, was issued, with an apologetic reference to the
necessity of reprinting the poem to prevent its circulation in an
unauthorised form. But the 1879 issue is considerably altered from the
original issue of 1833, as written by Tennyson in his nineteenth year.
Since only as a product of Tennyson's youth does the poem merit any
attention, it has seemed good to reprint it here as originally
written.]

A FRAGMENT

The Poem of the Lover's Tale (the lover is supposed to be himself a
poet) was written in my nineteenth year, and consequently contains
nearly as many faults as words. That I deemed it not wholly unoriginal
is my only apology for its publication--an apology lame and poor, and
somewhat impertinent to boot: so that if its infirmities meet with
more laughter than charity in the world, I shall not raise my voice in
its defence. I am aware how deficient the Poem is in point of art, and
it is not without considerable misgivings that I have ventured to
publish even this fragment of it. 'Enough,' says the old proverb, 'is
as good as a feast.'--(Tennyson's original introductory note.)

  Here far away, seen from the topmost cliff,
  Filling with purple gloom the vacancies
  Between the tufted hills the sloping seas
  Hung in mid-heaven, and half-way down rare sails,
  White as white clouds, floated from sky to sky.
  Oh! pleasant breast of waters, quiet bay,
  Like to a quiet mind in the loud world,
  Where the chafed breakers of the outer sea
  Sunk powerless, even as anger falls aside,
  And withers on the breast of peaceful love,
  Thou didst receive that belt of pines, that fledged
  The hills that watch'd thee, as Love watcheth Love,--
  In thine own essence, and delight thyself
  To make it wholly thine on sunny days.
  Keep thou thy name of 'Lover's bay': See, Sirs,
  Even now the Goddess of the Past, that takes
  The heart, and sometimes toucheth but one string,
  That quivers, and is silent, and sometimes
  Sweeps suddenly all its half-moulder'd chords
  To an old melody, begins to play
  On those first-moved fibres of the brain.
  I come, Great mistress of the ear and eye:
  Oh! lead me tenderly, for fear the mind
  Rain thro' my sight, and strangling sorrow weigh
  Mine utterance with lameness. Tho' long years
  Have hallowed out a valley and a gulf
  Betwixt the native land of Love and me,
  Breathe but a little on me, and the sail
  Will draw me to the rising of the sun,
  The lucid chambers of the morning star,
  And East of life.
                    Permit me, friend, I prithee,
  To pass my hand across my brows, and muse
  On those dear hills, that nevermore will meet
  The sight that throbs and aches beneath my touch,
  As tho' there beat a heart in either eye;
  For when the outer lights are darken'd thus,
  The memory's vision hath a keener edge.
  It grows upon me now--the semicircle
  Of dark blue waters and the narrow fringe
  Of curving beach--its wreaths of dripping green--
  Its pale pink shells--the summer-house aloft
  That open'd on the pines with doors of glass,
  A mountain nest the pleasure boat that rock'd
  Light-green with its own shadow, keel to keel,
  Upon the crispings of the dappled waves
  That blanched upon its side.
                               O Love, O Hope,
  They come, they crowd upon me all at once,
  Moved from the cloud of unforgotten things,
  That sometimes on the horizon of the mind
  Lies folded--often sweeps athwart in storm--
  They flash across the darkness of my brain,
  The many pleasant days, the moolit nights,
  The dewy dawnings and the amber eyes,
  When thou and I, Camilla, thou and I
  Were borne about the bay, or safely moor'd
  Beneath some low brow'd cavern, where the wave
  Plash'd sapping its worn ribs (the while without,
  And close above us, sang the wind-tost pine,
  And shook its earthly socket, for we heard,
  In rising and in falling with the tide,
  Close by our ears, the huge roots strain and creak),
  Eye feeding upon eye with deep intent;
  And mine, with love too high to be express'd
  Arrested in its sphere, and ceasing from
  All contemplation of all forms, did pause
  To worship mine own image, laved in light,
  The centre of the splendours, all unworthy
  Of such a shrine--mine image in her eyes,
  By diminution made most glorious,
  Moved with their motions, as those eyes were moved
  With motions of the soul, as my heart beat
  Twice to the melody of hers. Her face
  Was starry-fair, not pale, tenderly flush'd
  As 'twere with dawn. She was dark-hair'd, dark-eyed;
  Oh, such dark eyes! A single glance of them
  Will govern a whole life from birth to death,
  Careless of all things else, led on with light
  In trances and in visions: look at them,
  You lose yourself in utter ignorance,
  You cannot find their depth; for they go back,
  And farther back, and still withdraw themselves
  Quite into the deep soul, that evermore,
  Fresh springing from her fountains in the brain,
  Still pouring thro', floods with redundant light
  Her narrow portals.

                      Trust me, long ago
  I should have died, if it were possible
  To die in gazing on that perfectness
  Which I do bear within me; I had died
  But from my farthest lapse, my latest ebb,
  Thine image, like a charm of light and strength
  Upon the waters, pushed me back again
  On these deserted sands of barren life.
  Tho' from the deep vault, where the heart of hope
  Fell into dust, and crumbled in the dark--
  Forgetting who to render beautiful
  Her countenance with quick and healthful blood--
  Thou didst not sway me upward, could I perish
  With such a costly casket in the grasp
  Of memory? He, that saith it, hath o'erstepp'd
  The slippery footing of his narrow wit,
  And fall'n away from judgment. Thou art light,
  To which my spirit leaneth all her flowers,
  And length of days, and immortality
  Of thought, and freshness ever self-renew'd.
  For Time and Grief abode too long with Life,
  And like all other friends i' the world, at last
  They grew aweary of her fellowship:
  So Time and Grief did beckon unto Death,
  And Death drew nigh and beat the doors of Life;
  But thou didst sit alone in the inner house,
  A wakeful port'ress and didst parle with Death,
  'This is a charmed dwelling which I hold';
  So Death gave back, and would no further come.
  Yet is my life nor in the present time,
  Nor in the present place. To me alone,
  Pushed from his chair of regal heritage,
  The Present is the vassal of the Past:
  So that, in that I _have_ lived, do I live,
  And cannot die, and am, in having been,
  A portion of the pleasant yesterday,
  Thrust forward on to-day and out of place;
  A body journeying onward, sick with toil,
  The lithe limbs bow'd as with a heavy weight
  And all the senses weaken'd in all save that
  Which, long ago, they had glean'd and garner'd up
  Into the granaries of memory--
  The clear brow, bulwark of the precious brain,
  Now seam'd and chink'd with years--and all the while
  The light soul twines and mingles with the growths
  Of vigorous early days, attracted, won,
  Married, made one with, molten into all
  The beautiful in Past of act or place.
  Even as the all-enduring camel, driven
  Far from the diamond fountain by the palms,
  Toils onward thro' the middle moonlight nights,
  Shadow'd and crimson'd with the drifting dust,
  Or when the white heats of the blinding noons
  Beat from the concave sand; yet in him keeps
  A draught of that sweet fountain that he loves,
  To stay his feet from falling, and his spirit
  From bitterness of death.

                            Ye ask me, friends,
  When I began to love. How should I tell ye?
  Or from the after fulness of my heart,
  Flow back again unto my slender spring
  And first of love, tho' every turn and depth
  Between is clearer in my life than all
  Its present flow. Ye know not what ye ask.
  How should the broad and open flower tell
  What sort of bud it was, when press'd together
  In its green sheath, close lapt in silken folds?
  It seemed to keep its sweetness to itself,
  Yet was not the less sweet for that it seem'd.
  For young Life knows not when young Life was born,
  But takes it all for granted: neither Love,
  Warm in the heart, his cradle can remember
  Love in the womb, but resteth satisfied,
  Looking on her that brought him to the light:
  Or as men know not when they fall asleep
  Into delicious dreams, our other life,
  So know I not when I began to love.
  This is my sum of knowledge--that my love
  Grew with myself--and say rather, was my growth,
  My inward sap, the hold I have on earth,
  My outward circling air wherein I breathe,
  Which yet upholds my life, and evermore
  Was to me daily life and daily death:
  For how should I have lived and not have loved?
  Can ye take off the sweetness from the flower,
  The colour and the sweetness from the rose,
  And place them by themselves? or set apart
  Their motions and their brightness from the stars,
  And then point out the flower or the star?
  Or build a wall betwixt my life and love,
  And tell me where I am? 'Tis even thus:
  In that I live I love; because I love
  I live: whate'er is fountain to the one
  Is fountain to the other; and whene'er
  Our God unknits the riddle of the one,
  There is no shade or fold of mystery
  Swathing the other.

                      Many, many years,
  For they seem many and my most of life,
  And well I could have linger'd in that porch,
  So unproportioned to the dwelling place,
  In the maydews of childhood, opposite
  The flush and dawn of youth, we lived together,
  Apart, alone together on those hills.
  Before he saw my day my father died,
  And he was happy that he saw it not:
  But I and the first daisy on his grave
  From the same clay came into light at once.
  As Love and I do number equal years
  So she, my love, is of an age with me.
  How like each other was the birth of each!
  The sister of my mother--she that bore
  Camilla close beneath her beating heart,
  Which to the imprisoned spirit of the child,
  With its true touched pulses in the flow
  And hourly visitation of the blood,
  Sent notes of preparation manifold,
  And mellow'd echoes of the outer world--
  My mother's sister, mother of my love,
  Who had a twofold claim upon my heart,
  One twofold mightier than the other was,
  In giving so much beauty to the world,
  And so much wealth as God had charged her with,
  Loathing to put it from herself for ever,
  Crown'd with her highest act the placid face
  And breathless body of her good deeds past.
  So we were born, so orphan'd. She was motherless,
  And I without a father. So from each
  Of those two pillars which from earth uphold
  Our childhood, one had fall'n away, and all
  The careful burthen of our tender years
  Trembled upon the other. He that gave
  Her life, to me delightedly fulfill'd
  All loving-kindnesses, all offices
  Of watchful care and trembling tenderness.
  He worked for both: he pray'd for both: he slept
  Dreaming of both; nor was his love the less
  Because it was divided, and shot forth
  Boughs on each side, laden with wholesome shade,
  Wherein we rested sleeping or awake,
  And sung aloud the matin-song of life.

  She was my foster-sister: on one arm
  The flaxen ringlets of our infancies
  Wander'd, the while we rested: one soft lap
  Pillow'd us both: one common light of eyes
  Was on us as we lay: our baby lips,
  Kissing one bosom, ever drew from thence
  The stream of life, one stream, one life, one blood,
  One sustenance, which, still as thought grew large,
  Still larger moulding all the house of thought,
  Perchance assimilated all our tastes
  And future fancies. 'Tis a beautiful
  And pleasant meditation, what whate'er
  Our general mother meant for me alone,
  Our mutual mother dealt to both of us:
  So what was earliest mine in earliest life,
  I shared with her in whom myself remains.
  As was our childhood, so our infancy,
  They tell me, was a very miracle
  Of fellow-feeling and communion.
  They tell me that we would not be alone,--
  We cried when we were parted; when I wept,
  Her smile lit up the rainbow on my tears,
  Stay'd on the clouds of sorrow; that we loved
  The sound of one another's voices more
  Than the grey cuckoo loves his name, and learn'd
  To lisp in tune together; that we slept
  In the same cradle always, face to face,
  Heart beating time to heart, lip pressing lip,
  Folding each other, breathing on each other,
  Dreaming together (dreaming of each other
  They should have added) till the morning light
  Sloped thro' the pines, upon the dewy pane
  Falling, unseal'd our eyelids, and we woke
  To gaze upon each other. If this be true,
  At thought of which my whole soul languishes
  And faints, and hath no pulse, no breath, as tho'
  A man in some still garden should infuse
  Rich attar in the bosom of the rose,
  Till, drunk with its own wine and overfull
  Of sweetness, and in smelling of itself,
  It fall on its own thorns--if this be true--
  And that way my wish leaneth evermore
  Still to believe it--'tis so sweet a thought,
  Why in the utter stillness of the soul
  Doth question'd memory answer not, nor tell,
  Of this our earliest, our closest drawn,
  Most loveliest, most delicious union?
  Oh, happy, happy outset of my days!
  Green springtide, April promise, glad new year
  Of Being, which with earliest violets,
  And lavish carol of clear-throated larks,
  Fill'd all the march of life.--I will not speak of thee;
  These have not seen thee, these can never know thee,
  They cannot understand me. Pass on then
  A term of eighteen years. Ye would but laugh
  If I should tell ye how I heard in thought
  Those rhymes, 'The Lion and the Unicorn'
  'The Four-and-twenty Blackbirds' 'Banbury Cross,'
  'The Gander' and 'The man of Mitylene,'
  And all the quaint old scraps of ancient crones,
  Which are as gems set in my memory,
  Because she learn'd them with me. Or what profits it
  To tell ye that her father died, just ere
  The daffodil was blown; or how we found
  The drowned seaman on the shore? These things
  Unto the quiet daylight of your minds
  Are cloud and smoke, but in the dark of mine
  Show traced with flame. Move with me to that hour,
  Which was the hinge on which the door of Hope,
  Once turning, open'd far into the outward,
  And never closed again.

                        I well remember,
  It was a glorious morning, such a one
  As dawns but once a season. Mercury
  On such a morning would have flung himself
  From cloud to cloud, and swum with balanced wings
  To some tall mountain. On that day the year
  First felt his youth and strength, and from his spring
  Moved smiling toward his summer. On that day,
  Love working shook his wings (that charged the winds
  With spiced May-sweets from bound to bound) and blew
  Fresh fire into the sun, and from within
  Burst thro' the heated buds, and sent his soul
  Into the songs of birds, and touch'd far-off
  His mountain-altars, his high hills, with flame
  Milder and purer. Up the rocks we wound;
  The great pine shook with lovely sounds of joy,
  That came on the sea-wind. As mountain brooks
  Our blood ran free: the sunshine seem'd to brood
  More warmly on the heart than on the brow.
  We often paused, and looking back, we saw
  The clefts and openings in the hills all fill'd
  With the blue valley and the glistening brooks,
  And with the low dark groves--a land of Love;
  Where Love was worshipp'd upon every height,
  Where Love was worshipp'd under every tree--
  A land of promise, flowing with the milk
  And honey of delicious memories
  Down to the sea, as far as eye could ken,
  From verge to verge it was a holy land,
  Still growing holier as you near'd the bay,
  For where the temple stood. When we had reach'd
  The grassy platform on some hill, I stoop'd,
  I gather'd the wild herbs, and for her brows
  And mine wove chaplets of the self-same flower,
  Which she took smiling, and with my work there
  Crown'd her clear forehead. Once or twice she told me
  (For I remember all things), to let grow
  The flowers that run poison in their veins.
  She said, 'The evil flourish in the world';
  Then playfully she gave herself the lie:
  'Nothing in nature is unbeautiful,
  So, brother, pluck and spare not.' So I wove
  Even the dull-blooded poppy, 'whose red flower
  Hued with the scarlet of a fierce sunrise,
  Like to the wild youth of an evil king,
  Is without sweetness, but who crowns himself
  Above the secret poisons of his heart
  In his old age'--a graceful thought of hers
  Graven on my fancy! As I said, with these
  She crown'd her forehead. O how like a nymph,
  A stately mountain-nymph, she look'd! how native
  Unto the hills she trod on! What an angel!
  How clothed with beams! My eyes, fix'd upon hers,
  Almost forgot even to move again.
  My spirit leap'd as with those thrills of bliss
  That shoot across the soul in prayer, and show us
  That we are surely heard. Methought a light
  Burst from the garland I had woven, and stood
  A solid glory on her bright black hair:
  A light, methought, broke from her dark, dark eyes,
  And shot itself into the singing winds;
  A light, methought, flash'd even from her white robe,
  As from a glass in the sun, and fell about
  My footsteps on the mountains.

                      About sunset
  We came unto the hill of woe, so call'd
  Because the legend ran that, long time since,
  One rainy night, when every wind blew loud,
  A woful man had thrust his wife and child
  With shouts from off the bridge, and following, plunged
  Into the dizzy chasm below. Below,
  Sheer thro' the black-wall'd cliff the rapid brook
  Shot down his inner thunders, built above
  With matted bramble and the shining gloss
  Of ivy-leaves, whose low-hung tresses, dipp'd
  In the fierce stream, bore downward with the wave.
  The path was steep and loosely strewn with crags
  We mounted slowly: yet to both of us
  It was delight, not hindrance: unto both
  Delight from hardship to be overcome,
  And scorn of perilous seeming: unto me
  Intense delight and rapture that I breathed,
  As with a sense of nigher Deity,
  With her to whom all outward fairest things
  Were by the busy mind referr'd, compared,
  As bearing no essential fruits of excellence.
  Save as they were the types and shadowings
  Of hers--and then that I became to her
  A tutelary angel as she rose,
  And with a fearful self-impelling joy
  Saw round her feet the country far away,
  Beyond the nearest mountain's bosky brows,
  Burst into open prospect--heath and hill,
  And hollow lined and wooded to the lips--
  And steep down walls of battlemented rock
  Girded with broom or shiver'd into peaks--
  And glory of broad waters interfused,
  Whence rose as it were breath and steam of gold;
  And over all the great wood rioting
  And climbing, starr'd at slender intervals
  With blossom tufts of purest white; and last,
  Framing the mighty landskip to the West,
  A purple range of purple cones, between
  Whose interspaces gush'd, in blinding bursts,
  The incorporate light of sun and sea.

                            At length,
  Upon the tremulous bridge, that from beneath
  Seemed with a cobweb firmament to link
  The earthquake-shattered chasm, hung with shrubs,
  We passed with tears of rapture. All the West,
  And even unto the middle South, was ribb'd
  And barr'd with bloom on bloom. The sun beneath,
  Held for a space 'twixt cloud and wave, shower'd down
  Rays of a mighty circle, weaving over
  That varied wilderness a tissue of light
  Unparallel'd. On the other side the moon,
  Half-melted into thin blue air, stood still
  And pale and fibrous as a wither'd leaf,
  Nor yet endured in presence of his eyes
  To imbue his lustre; most unloverlike;
  Since in his absence full of light and joy
  And giving light to others. But this chiefest,
  Next to her presence whom I loved so well,
  Spoke loudly, even into my inmost heart,
  As to my outward hearing: the loud stream,
  Forth issuing from his portals in the crag
  (A visible link unto the home of my heart),
  Ran amber toward the West, and nigh the sea,
  Parting my own loved mountains, was received
  Shorn of its strength, into the sympathy
  Of that small bay, which into open main
  Glow'd intermingling close beneath the sun
  Spirit of Love! That little hour was bound,
  Shut in from Time, and dedicate to thee;
  Thy fires from heav'n had touch'd it, and the earth
  They fell on became hallow'd evermore.

  We turn'd: our eyes met: her's were bright, and mine
  Were dim with floating tears, that shot the sunset,
  In light rings round me; and my name was borne
  Upon her breath. Henceforth my name has been
  A hallow'd memory, like the names of old;
  A center'd, glory-circled memory,
  And a peculiar treasure, brooking not
  Exchange or currency; and in that hour
  A hope flow'd round me, like a golden mist
  Charm'd amid eddies of melodious airs,
  A moment, ere the onward whirlwind shatter it,
  Waver'd and floated--which was less than Hope,
  Because it lack'd the power of perfect Hope;
  But which was more and higher than all Hope,
  Because all other Hope hath lower aim;
  Even that this name to which her seraph lips
  Did lend such gentle utterance, this one name
  In some obscure hereafter, might inwreathe
  (How lovelier, nobler then!) her life, her love,
  With my life, love, soul, spirit and heart and strength.

  'Brother,' she said, 'let this be call'd henceforth
  The Hill of Hope'; and I replied: 'O sister,
  My will is one with thine; the Hill of Hope.'
  Nevertheless, we did not change the name.

  Love lieth deep; Love dwells not in lip-depths:
  Love wraps her wings on either side the heart,
  Constraining it with kisses close and warm,
  Absorbing all the incense of sweet thoughts
  So that they pass not to the shrine of sound.
  Else had the life of that delighted hour
  Drunk in the largeness of the utterance
  Of Love; but how should earthly measure mete
  The heavenly unmeasured or unlimited Love,
  Which scarce can tune his high majestic sense
  Unto the thunder-song that wheels the spheres;
  Scarce living in the Aeolian harmony,
  And flowing odour of the spacious air;
  Scarce housed in the circle of this earth:
  Be cabin'd up in words and syllables,
  Which waste with the breath that made 'em.
                          Sooner earth
  Might go round heaven, and the straight girth of Time
  Inswathe the fullness of Eternity,
  Than language grasp the infinite of Love.
  O day, which did enwomb that happy hour,
  Thou art blest in the years, divinest day!
  O Genius of that hour which dost uphold
  Thy coronal of glory like a God,
  Amid thy melancholy mates far-seen,
  Who walk before thee, and whose eyes are dim
  With gazing on the light and depth of thine
  Thy name is ever worshipp'd among hours!
  Had I died then, I had not seem'd to die
  For bliss stood round me like the lights of heaven,
  That cannot fade, they are so burning bright.
  Had I died then, I had not known the death;
  Planting my feet against this mound of time
  I had thrown me on the vast, and from this impulse
  Continuing and gathering ever, ever,
  Agglomerated swiftness, I had lived
  That intense moment thro' eternity.
  Oh, had the Power from whose right hand the light
  Of Life issueth, and from whose left hand floweth
  The shadow of Death, perennial effluences,
  Whereof to all that draw the wholesome air,
  Somewhile the one must overflow the other;
  Then had he stemm'd my day with night and driven
  My current to the fountain whence it sprang--
  Even his own abiding excellence--
  On me, methinks, that shock of gloom had fall'n
  Unfelt, and like the sun I gazed upon,
  Which, lapt in seeming dissolution,
  And dipping his head low beneath the verge,
  Yet bearing round about him his own day,
  In confidence of unabated strength,
  Steppeth from heaven to heaven, from light to light,
  And holding his undimmed forehead far
  Into a clearer zenith, pure of cloud;
  So bearing on thro' Being limitless
  The triumph of this foretaste, I had merged
  Glory in glory, without sense of change.

  We trod the shadow of the downward hill;
  We pass'd from light to dark. On the other side
  Is scooped a cavern and a mountain-hall,
  Which none have fathom'd. If you go far in
  (The country people rumour) you may hear
  The moaning of the woman and the child,
  Shut in the secret chambers of the rock.
  I too have heard a sound--perchance of streams
  Running far-off within its inmost halls,
  The home of darkness, but the cavern mouth,
  Half overtrailed with a wanton weed
  Gives birth to a brawling stream, that stepping lightly
  Adown a natural stair of tangled roots,
  Is presently received in a sweet grove
  Of eglantine, a place of burial
  Far lovelier than its cradle; for unseen
  But taken with the sweetness of the place,
  It giveth out a constant melody
  That drowns the nearer echoes. Lower down
  Spreads out a little lake, that, flooding, makes
  Cushions of yellow sand; and from the woods
  That belt it rise three dark tall cypresses;
  Three cypresses, symbols of mortal woe,
  That men plant over graves.

                   Hither we came,
  And sitting down upon the golden moss
  Held converse sweet and low--low converse sweet,
  In which our voices bore least part. The wind
  Told a love-tale beside us, how he woo'd
  The waters, and the crisp'd waters lisp'd
  The kisses of the wind, that, sick with love,
  Fainted at intervals, and grew again
  To utterance of passion. Ye cannot shape
  Fancy so fair as is this memory.
  Methought all excellence that ever was
  Had drawn herself from many thousand years,
  And all the separate Edens of this earth,
  To centre in this place and time. I listen'd,
  And her words stole with most prevailing sweetness
  Into my heart, as thronged fancies come,
  All unawares, into the poet's brain;
  Or as the dew-drops on the petal hung,
  When summer winds break their soft sleep with sighs,
  Creep down into the bottom of the flower.
  Her words were like a coronal of wild blooms
  Strung in the very negligence of Art,
  Or in the art of Nature, where each rose
  Doth faint upon the bosom of the other,
  Flooding its angry cheek with odorous tears.
  So each with each inwoven lived with each,
  And were in union more than double-sweet.
  What marvel my Camilla told me all?
  It was so happy an hour, so sweet a place,
  And I was as the brother of her blood,
  And by that name was wont to live in her speech,
  Dear name! which had too much of nearness in it
  And heralded the distance of this time.
  At first her voice was very sweet and low,
  As tho' she were afeard of utterance;
  But in the onward current of her speech,
  (As echoes of the hollow-banked brooks
  Are fashioned by the channel which they keep)
  His words did of their meaning borrow sound,
  Her cheek did catch the colour of her words,
  I heard and trembled, yet I could but hear;
  My heart paused,--my raised eyelids would not fall,
  But still I kept my eyes upon the sky.
  I seem'd the only part of Time stood still,
  And saw the motion of all other things;
  While her words, syllable by syllable,
  Like water, drop by drop, upon my ear
  Fell, and I wish'd, yet wish'd her not to speak,
  But she spoke on, for I did name no wish.
  What marvel my Camilla told me all
  Her maiden dignities of Hope and Love,
  'Perchance' she said 'return'd.' Even then the stars
  Did tremble in their stations as I gazed;
  But she spake on, for I did name no wish,
  No wish--no hope. Hope was not wholly dead,
  But breathing hard at the approach of Death,
  Updrawn in expectation of her change--
  Camilla, my Camilla, who was mine
  No longer in the dearest use of mine--
  The written secrets of her inmost soul
  Lay like an open scroll before my view,
  And my eyes read, they read aright, her heart
  Was Lionel's: it seem'd as tho' a link
  Of some light chain within my inmost frame
  Was riven in twain: that life I heeded not
  Flow'd from me, and the darkness of the grave,
  The darkness of the grave and utter night,
  Did swallow up my vision: at her feet,
  Even the feet of her I loved, I fell,
  Smit with exceeding sorrow unto death.

  Then had the earth beneath me yawning given
  Sign of convulsion; and tho' horrid rifts
  Sent up the moaning of unhappy spirits
  Imprison'd in her centre, with the heat
  Of their infolding element; had the angels,
  The watchers at heaven's gate, push'd them apart,
  And from the golden threshold had down-roll'd
  Their heaviest thunder, I had lain as still,
  And blind and motionless as then I lay!
  White as quench'd ashes, cold as were the hopes
  Of my lorn love! What happy air shall woo
  The wither'd leaf fall'n in the woods, or blasted
  Upon this bough? a lightning stroke had come
  Even from that Heaven in whose light I bloom'd
  And taken away the greenness of my life,
  The blossom and the fragrance. Who was cursed
  But I? who miserable but I? even Misery
  Forgot herself in that extreme distress,
  And with the overdoing of her part
  Did fall away into oblivion.
  The night in pity took away my day
  Because my grief as yet was newly born,
  Of too weak eyes to look upon the light,
  And with the hasty notice of the ear,
  Frail life was startled from the tender love
  Of him she brooded over. Would I had lain
  Until the pleached ivy tress had wound
  Round my worn limbs, and the wild briar had driven
  Its knotted thorns thro' my unpaining brows
  Leaning its roses on my faded eyes.
  The wind had blown above me, and the rain
  Had fall'n upon me, and the gilded snake
  Had nestled in this bosomthrone of love,
  But I had been at rest for evermore.
  Long time entrancement held me: all too soon,
  Life (like a wanton too-officious friend
  Who will not hear denial, vain and rude
  With proffer of unwished for services)
  Entering all the avenues of sense,
  Pass'd thro' into his citadel, the brain
  With hated warmth of apprehensiveness:
  And first the chillness of the mountain stream
  Smote on my brow, and then I seem'd to hear
  Its murmur, as the drowning seaman hears,
  Who with his head below the surface dropt,
  Listens the dreadful murmur indistinct
  Of the confused seas, and knoweth not
  Beyond the sound he lists: and then came in
  O'erhead the white light of the weary moon,
  Diffused and molten into flaky cloud.
  Was my sight drunk, that it did shape to me
  Him who should own that name? or had my fancy
  So lethargised discernment in the sense,
  That she did act the step-dame to mine eyes,
  Warping their nature, till they minister'd
  Unto her swift conceits? 'Twere better thus
  If so be that the memory of that sound
  With mighty evocation, had updrawn
  The fashion and the phantasm of the form
  It should attach to. There was no such thing.--
  It was the man she loved, even Lionel,
  The lover Lionel, the happy Lionel,
  All joy; who drew the happy atmosphere
  Of my unhappy sighs, fed with my tears,
  To him the honey dews of orient hope.
  Oh! rather had some loathly ghastful brow,
  Half-bursten from the shroud, in cere cloth bound,
  The dead skin withering on the fretted bone,
  The very spirit of Paleness made still paler
  By the shuddering moonlight, fix'd his eyes on mine
  Horrible with the anger and the heat
  Of the remorseful soul alive within,
  And damn'd unto his loathed tenement.
  Methinks I could have sooner met that gaze!
  Oh, how her choice did leap forth from his eyes!
  Oh, how her love did clothe itself in smiles
  About his lips! This was the very arch-mock
  And insolence of uncontrolled Fate,
  When the effect weigh'd seas upon my head
  To twit me with the cause.
                          Why how was this?
  Could he not walk what paths he chose, nor breathe
  What airs he pleased! Was not the wide world free,
  With all her interchange of hill and plain
  To him as well as me? I know not, faith:
  But Misery, like a fretful, wayward child,
  Refused to look his author in the face,
  Must he come my way too? Was not the South,
  The East, the West, all open, if he had fall'n
  In love in twilight? Why should he come my way,
  Robed in those robes of light I must not wear,
  With that great crown of beams about his brows?
  Come like an angel to a damned soul?
  To tell him of the bliss he had with God;
  Come like a careless and a greedy heir,
  That scarce can wait the reading of the will
  Before he takes possession? Was mine a mood
  To be invaded rudely, and not rather
  A sacred, secret, unapproached woe
  Unspeakable? I was shut up with grief;
  She took the body of my past delight,
  Narded, and swathed and balm'd it for herself,
  And laid it in a new-hewn sepulchre,
  Where man had never lain. I was led mute
  Into her temple like a sacrifice;
  I was the high-priest in her holiest place,
  Not to be loudly broken in upon.
  Oh! friend, thoughts deep and heavy as these well-nigh
  O'erbore the limits of my brain; but he
  Bent o'er me, and my neck his arm upstay'd
  From earth. I thought it was an adder's fold,
  And once I strove to disengage myself,
  But fail'd, I was so feeble. She was there too:
  She bent above me too: her cheek was pale,
  Oh! very fair and pale: rare pity had stolen
  The living bloom away, as tho' a red rose
  Should change into a white one suddenly.
  Her eyes, I saw, were full of tears in the morn,
  And some few drops of that distressful rain
  Being wafted on the wind, drove in my sight,
  And being there they did break forth afresh
  In a new birth, immingled with my own,
  And still bewept my grief. Keeping unchanged
  The purport of their coinage. Her long ringlets,
  Drooping and beaten with the plaining wind,
  Did brush my forehead in their to-and-fro:
  For in the sudden anguish of her heart
  Loosed from their simple thrall they had flowed abroad,
  And onward floating in a full, dark wave,
  Parted on either side her argent neck,
  Mantling her form half way. She, when I woke,
  After my refluent health made tender quest
  Unanswer'd, for I spoke not: for the sound
  Of that dear voice so musically low,
  And now first heard with any sense of pain,
  As it had taken life away before,
  Choked all the syllables that in my throat
  Strove to uprise, laden with mournful thanks,
  From my full heart: and ever since that hour,
  My voice hath somewhat falter'd--and what wonder
  That when hope died, part of her eloquence
  Died with her? He, the blissful lover, too,
  From his great hoard of happiness distill'd
  Some drops of solace; like a vain rich man,
  That, having always prosper'd in the world,
  Folding his hands deals comfortable words
  To hearts wounded for ever; yet, in truth,
  Fair speech was his and delicate of phrase,
  Falling in whispers on the sense, address'd
  More to the inward than the outward ear,
  As rain of the midsummer midnight soft
  Scarce-heard, recalling fragrance and the green
  Of the dead spring--such as in other minds
  Had film'd the margents of the recent wound.
  And why was I to darken their pure love,
  If, as I knew, they two did love each other,
  Because my own was darken'd? Why was I
  To stand within the level of their hopes,
  Because my hope was widow'd, like the cur
  In the child's adage? Did I love Camilla?
  Ye know that I did love her: to this present
  My full-orb'd love hath waned not. Did I love her,
  And could I look upon her tearful eyes?
  Tears wept for me; for me--weep at my grief?
  What had _she_ done to weep--let my heart
  Break rather--whom the gentlest airs of heaven
  Should kiss with an unwonted gentleness.
  Her love did murder mine; what then? she deem'd
  I wore a brother's mind: she call'd me brother:
  She told me all her love: she shall not weep.

  The brightness of a burning thought awhile
  Battailing with the glooms of my dark will,
  Moonlike emerged, lit up unto itself,
  Upon the depths of an unfathom'd woe,
  Reflex of action, starting up at once,
  As men do from a vague and horrid dream,
  And throwing by all consciousness of self,
  In eager haste I shook him by the hand;
  Then flinging myself down upon my knees
  Even where the grass was warm where I had lain,
  I pray'd aloud to God that he would hold
  The hand of blessing over Lionel,
  And her whom he would make his wedded wife,
  Camilla! May their days be golden days,
  And their long life a dream of linked love,
  From which may rude Death never startle them,
  But grow upon them like a glorious vision
  Of unconceived and awful happiness,
  Solemn but splendid, full of shapes and sounds,
  Swallowing its precedent in victory.
  Let them so love that men and boys may say,
  Lo! how they love each other! till their love
  Shall ripen to a proverb unto all,
  Known when their faces are forgot in the land.
  And as for me, Camilla, as for me,
  Think not thy tears will make my name grow green,--
  The dew of tears is an unwholesome dew.
  The course of Hope is dried,--the life o' the plant--
  They will but sicken the sick plant more.
  Deem then I love thee but as brothers do,
  So shalt thou love me still as sisters do;
  Or if thou dream'st aught farther, dream but how
  I could have loved thee, had there been none else
  To love as lovers, loved again by thee.

  Or this, or somewhat like to this, I spoke,
  When I did see her weep so ruefully;
  For sure my love should ne'er induce the front
  And mask of Hate, whom woful ailments
  Of unavailing tears and heart deep moans
  Feed and envenom, as the milky blood
  Of hateful herbs a subtle-fanged snake.
  Shall Love pledge Hatred in her bitter draughts,
  And batten on his poisons? Love forbid!
  Love passeth not the threshold of cold Hate,
  And Hate is strange beneath the roof of Love.
  O Love, if thou be'st Love, dry up these tears
  Shed for the love of Love; for tho' mine image,
  The subject of thy power, be cold in her,
  Yet, like cold snow, it melteth in the source
  Of these sad tears, and feeds their downward flow.
  So Love, arraign'd to judgment and to death,
  Received unto himself a part of blame.
  Being guiltless, as an innocent prisoner,
  Who when the woful sentence hath been past,
  And all the clearness of his fame hath gone
  Beneath the shadow of the curse of men,
  First falls asleep in swoon. Wherefrom awaked
  And looking round upon his tearful friends,
  Forthwith and in his agony conceives
  A shameful sense as of a cleaving crime--
  For whence without some guilt should such grief be?
  So died that hour, and fell into the abysm
  Of forms outworn, but not to be outworn,
  Who never hail'd another worth the Life
  That made it sensible. So died that hour,
  Like odour wrapt into the winged wind
  Borne into alien lands and far away.
  There be some hearts so airy-fashioned,
  That in the death of love, if e'er they loved,
  On that sharp ridge of utmost doom ride highly
  Above the perilous seas of change and chance;
  Nay, more, holds out the lights of cheerfulness;
  As the tall ship, that many a dreary year
  Knit to some dismal sandbank far at sea,
  All through the lifelong hours of utter dark,
  Showers slanting light upon the dolorous wave.
  For me all other Hopes did sway from that
  Which hung the frailest: falling, they fell too,
  Crush'd link on link into the beaten earth,
  And Love did walk with banish'd Hope no more,
  It was ill-done to part ye, Sisters fair;
  Love's arms were wreathed about the neck of Hope,
  And Hope kiss'd Love, and Love drew in her breath
  In that close kiss, and drank her whisper'd tales.
  They said that Love would die when Hope was gone,
  And Love mourned long, and sorrowed after Hope;
  At last she sought out memory, and they trod
  The same old paths where Love had walked with Hope,
  And Memory fed the soul of Love with tears.

  II

  From that time forth I would not see her more,
  But many weary moons I lived alone--
  Alone, and in the heart of the great forest.
  Sometimes upon the hills beside the sea
  All day I watched the floating isles of shade,
  And sometimes on the shore, upon the sands
  Insensibly I drew her name, until
  The meaning of the letters shot into
  My brain: anon the wanton billow wash'd
  Them over, till they faded like my love.
  The hollow caverns heard me--the black brooks
  Of the mid-forest heard me--the soft winds,
  Laden with thistledown and seeds of flowers,
  Paused in their course to hear me, for my voice
  Was all of thee: the merry linnet knew me,
  The squirrel knew me, and the dragon-fly
  Shot by me like a flash of purple fire.
  The rough briar tore my bleeding palms; the hemlock,
  Brow high, did strike my forehead as I pas'd;
  Yet trod I not the wild-flower in my path,
  Nor bruised the wild-bird's egg.
                        Was this the end?
  Why grew we then together i' the same plot?
  Why fed we the same fountain? drew the same sun?
  Why were our mothers branches of one stem?
  Why were we one in all things, save in that
  Where to have been one had been the roof and crown
  Of all I hoped and fear'd? if that same nearness
  Were father to this distance, and that _one_
  Vauntcourier this _double_? If affection
  Living slew Love, and Sympathy hew'd out
  The bosom-sepulchre of Sympathy.

  Chiefly I sought the cavern and the hill
  Where last we roam'd together, for the sound
  Of the loud stream was pleasant, and the wind
  Came wooingly with violet smells. Sometimes
  All day I sat within the cavern-mouth,
  Fixing my eyes on those three cypress-cones
  Which spired above the wood; and with mad hand
  Tearing the bright leaves of the ivy-screen,
  I cast them in the noisy brook beneath,
  And watch'd them till they vanished from my sight
  Beneath the bower of wreathed eglantines:
  And all the fragments of the living rock,
  (Huge splinters, which the sap of earliest showers,
  Or moisture of the vapour, left in clinging,
  When the shrill storm-blast feeds it from behind,
  And scatters it before, had shatter'd from
  The mountain, till they fell, and with the shock
  Half dug their own graves), in mine agony,
  Did I make bear of all the deep rich moss
  Wherewith the dashing runnel in the spring
  Had liveried them all over. In my brain
  The spirit seem'd to flag from thought to thought,
  Like moonlight wandering through a mist: my blood
  Crept like the drains of a marsh thro' all my body;
  The motions of my heart seem'd far within me,
  Unfrequent, low, as tho' it told its pulses;
  And yet it shook me, that my frame did shudder,
  As it were drawn asunder by the rack.
  But over the deep graves of Hope and Fear,
  The wreck of ruin'd life and shatter'd thought,
  Brooded one master-passion evermore,
  Like to a low hung and a fiery sky
  Above some great metropolis, earth shock'd
  Hung round with ragged-rimmed burning folds,
  Embathing all with wild and woful hues--
  Great hills of ruins, and collapsed masses
  Of thunder-shaken columns, indistinct
  And fused together in the tyrannous light.

  So gazed I on the ruins of that thought
  Which was the playmate of my youth--for which
  I lived and breathed: the dew, the sun, the rain,
  Unto the growth of body and of mind;
  The blood, the breath, the feeling and the motion,
  The slope into the current of my years,
  Which drove them onward--made them sensible;
  The precious jewel of my honour'd life,
  Erewhile close couch'd in golden happiness,
  Now proved counterfeit, was shaken out,
  And, trampled on, left to its own decay.




The Lover's Tale

  Sometimes I thought Camilla was no more,
  Some one had told me she was dead, and ask'd me
  If I would see her burial: then I seem'd
  To rise, and thro' the forest-shadow borne
  With more than mortal swiftness, I ran down
  The sleepy sea-bank, till I came upon
  The rear of a procession, curving round
  The silver-sheeted bay: in front of which
  Six stately virgins, all in white, upbare
  A broad earth-sweeping pall of whitest lawn,
  Wreathed round the bier with garlands: in the distance,
  From out the yellow woods, upon the hill,
  Look'd forth the summit and the pinnacles
  Of a grey steeple. All the pageantry,
  Save those six virgins which upheld the bier,
  Were stoled from head to foot in flowing black;
  One walk'd abreast with me, and veiled his brow,
  And he was loud in weeping and in praise
  Of the departed: a strong sympathy
  Shook all my soul: I flung myself upon him
  In tears and cries: I told him all my love,
  How I had loved her from the first; whereat
  He shrunk and howl'd, and from his brow drew back
  His hand to push me from him; and the face
  The very face and form of Lionel,
  Flash'd through my eyes into my innermost brain,
  And at his feet I seemed to faint and fall,
  To fall and die away. I could not rise,
  Albeit I strove to follow. They pass'd on,
  The lordly Phantasms; in their floating folds
  They pass'd and were no more: but I had fall'n
  Prone by the dashing runnel on the grass.

  Always th' inaudible, invisible thought
  Artificer and subject, lord and slave
  Shaped by the audible and visible,
  Moulded the audible and visible;
  All crisped sounds of wave, and leaf and wind,
  Flatter'd the fancy of my fading brain;
  The storm-pavilion'd element, the wood,
  The mountain, the three cypresses, the cave,
  Were wrought into the tissue of my dream.
  The moanings in the forest, the loud stream,
  Awoke me not, but were a part of sleep;
  And voices in the distance, calling to me,
  And in my vision bidding me dream on,
  Like sounds within the twilight realms of dreams,
  Which wander round the bases of the hills,
  And murmur in the low-dropt eaves of sleep,
  But faint within the portals. Oftentimes
  The vision had fair prelude, in the end
  Opening on darkness, stately vestibules
  To cares and shows of Death; whether the mind,
  With a revenge even to itself unknown,
  Made strange division of its suffering
  With her, whom to have suffering view'd had been
  Extremest pain; or that the clear-eyed Spirit,
  Being blasted in the Present, grew at length
  Prophetical and prescient of whate'er
  The Future had in store; or that which most
  Enchains belief, the sorrow of my spirit
  Was of so wide a compass it took in
  All I had loved, and my dull agony.
  Ideally to her transferred, became
  Anguish intolerable.
                 The day waned;
  Alone I sat with her: about my brow
  Her warm breath floated in the utterance
  Of silver-chorded tones: her lips were sunder'd
  With smiles of tranquil bliss, which broke in light
  Like morning from her eyes--her eloquent eyes
  (As I have seen them many hundred times),
  Fill'd all with clear pure fire, thro' mine down rain'd
  Their spirit-searching splendours. As a vision
  Unto a haggard prisoner, iron-stay'd
  In damp and dismal dungeons underground
  Confined on points of faith, when strength is shock'd
  With torment, and expectancy of worse
  Upon the morrow, thro' the ragged walls,
  All unawares before his half-shut eyes,
  Comes in upon him in the dead of night,
  And with th' excess of sweetness and of awe,
  Makes the heart tremble, and the eyes run over
  Upon his steely gyves; so those fair eyes
  Shone on my darkness forms which ever stood
  Within the magic cirque of memory,
  Invisible but deathless, waiting still
  The edict of the will to reassume
  The semblance of those rare realities
  Of which they were the mirrors. Now the light,
  Which was their life, burst through the cloud of thought
  Keen, irrepressible.
                        It was a room
  Within the summer-house of which I spoke,
  Hung round with paintings of the sea, and one
  A vessel in mid-ocean, her heaved prow
  Clambering, the mast bent, and the revin wind
  In her sail roaring. From the outer day,
  Betwixt the closest ivies came a broad
  And solid beam of isolated light,
  Crowded with driving atomies, and fell
  Slanting upon that picture, from prime youth
  Well-known, well-loved. She drew it long ago
  Forth gazing on the waste and open sea,
  One morning when the upblown billow ran
  Shoreward beneath red clouds, and I had pour'd
  Into the shadowing pencil's naked forms
  Colour and life: it was a bond and seal
  Of friendship, spoken of with tearful smiles;
  A monument of childhood and of love,
  The poesy of childhood; my lost love
  Symbol'd in storm. We gazed on it together
  In mute and glad remembrance, and each heart
  Grew closer to the other, and the eye
  Was riveted and charm-bound, gazing like
  The Indian on a still-eyed snake, low crouch'd
  A beauty which is death, when all at once
  That painted vessel, as with inner life,
  'Gan rock and heave upon that painted sea;
  An earthquake, my loud heartbeats, made the ground
  Roll under us, and all at once soul, life,
  And breath, and motion, pass'd and flow'd away
  To those unreal billows: round and round
  A whirlwind caught and bore us; mighty gyves,
  Rapid and vast, of hissing spray wind-driven
  Far through the dizzy dark. Aloud she shriek'd--
  My heart was cloven with pain. I wound my arms
  About her: we whirl'd giddily: the wind
  Sung: but I clasp'd her without fear: her weight
  Shrank in my grasp, and over my dim eyes
  And parted lips which drank her breath, down hung
  The jaws of Death: I, screaming, from me flung
  The empty phantom: all the sway and whirl
  Of the storm dropt to windless calm, and I
  Down welter'd thro' the dark ever and ever.




Index to First Lines


A gate and a field half ploughed
All thoughts, all creeds, all dreams, are true
Angels have talked with him and showed him thrones
As when a man, that sails in a balloon
Blow ye the trumpets, gather from afar
But she tarries in her place
Check every outflash, every ruder sally
Could I outwear my present state of woe
Ere yet my heart was sweet Love's tomb
Every day hath its night
First drink a health, this solemn night
God bless our Prince and Bride
Heaven weeps above the earth all night
Here far away, seen from the topmost cliff
His eyes in eclipse
Home they brought him slain with spears
How much I love this writer's manly style
How often, when a child I lay reclined
I am any man's suitor
I stood on a tower in the wet
I stood upon the Mountain which o'erlooks
I' the glooming light
Me my own fate to lasting sorrow doometh
My Rosalind, my Rosalind
O darling room, my heart's delight
Oh, Beauty, passing beauty! sweetest sweet!
Oh, go not yet, my love
O maiden fresher than the first green leaf
O sad _No more_! O sweet _No more_
O thou whose fringed lids I gaze upon
Rise, Britons, rise, if manhood be not dead
Sainted Juliet! dearest name
Shall the hag Evil die with the child of Good
Sure never yet was Antelope
The lintwhite and the throstlecock
The Northwind fall'n in the new starred night
The pallid thunderstricken sigh for gain
There are three things that fill my heart with sighs
Therefore your halls, your ancient colleges
There is no land like England
The varied earth, the moving heaven
Thou, from the first, unborn, undying love
Though Night hath climbed her peak
Two bees within a chrystal flowerbell rocked
Voice of the summerwind
We have had enough of motion
We know him, out of Shakespeare's art
What time I wasted youthful hours
Where is the Giant of the Sun, which stood
Who can say
Who fears to die? Who fears to die
With roses musky breathed
You cast to ground the hope which once was mine
You did late review my lays
Your ringlets, your ringlets

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

To my Young Readers.


Alfred Lord Tennyson was the typically English poet, and none, perhaps
not even Shakespeare, has appealed so keenly to the human heart. No
other man's poems have caused as many readers to shed tears of sympathy
nor have awakened higher sentiments in the human heart. The critics
agree in pronouncing him the ideal poet laureate. In his "Idylls from
the King" are found the loftiest and proudest deeds of English history
and even in the retelling of these in prose the high spirit that is an
inspiration to the noblest deeds cannot fail to be preserved.

                                         MOLLY K. BELLEW.




THE COMING OF KING ARTHUR.


Over a thousand years ago everybody was talking about the wonderful King
Arthur and his brilliant Knights of the Round Table, who everywhere were
pursuing bold quests, putting to rout the band of outlaws and robbers
which in those days infested every highway and by-way of the country,
going to war with tyrannical nobles, establishing law and order among
the rich, redressing the wrongs of women, the poor and the oppressed,
and winning glorious renown for their valor and their successes.

That was in England which at that time was not England as it is today,
all one kingdom under a single ruler, but was divided into many bits of
kingdoms each with its own king and all warring against each other.
Arthur's kingdom was the most unpeaceful of all. This was because for
twenty years or more, ever since the death of old King Uther, the
country had been without a ruler. Old King Uther had died about a score
of years before without leaving an heir to the throne, and all the
nobles of the realm had immediately gone to war with one another each
trying to get the most land and each trying to get the throne for
himself.

[Illustration: OLD MERLIN APPEARS.]

Suddenly, however, old Merlin, the wizard who had been King Uther's
magician, appeared one day in the royal council hall with a handsome
young man, Arthur, and declared him to be the king of the realm. Arthur
was crowned and for a time the nobles were quiet, for he ruled with a
strong hand of iron, put down all the evils in his kingdom and
everywhere gave it peace and order. People in every part of the island
sent for him and his knights, begging him to come to help them out of
their difficulties. But presently the nobles became troublesome again;
they said that Arthur was not the true king, that he was not the son of
Uther and that, therefore, he had no right to reign over them. So there
was fighting and unrest again, and in the midst of it Leodogran, the
king of the Land of Cameliard, asked Arthur to come with his knights and
drive away the enemies besetting him on every side. The country of
Cameliard had gone to waste and ruin, because of the continual warfare
that was waged with the kings that lived in the little neighboring
countries and a mass of wild-eyed foreign heathen peoples who invaded
the land. And so it happened that Cameliard was ravaged with battles,
its strong men were cut down with the sword and wild dogs, wolves, and
bears from the tangled weeds came rooting up the green fields and
wallowing into the palace gardens. Sometimes the wolves stole little
children from the villages and nursed them like their own cubs, until
finally these children grew up into a race of wolf-men who molested the
land worse than the wolves themselves. Then another king fought
Leodogran, and at last the heathen hordes came swarming from over the
seas and made all the earth red with his soldiers' blood, and they made
the sun red with the smoke of the burning homes of his people.

Leodogran simply did not know which way to turn for help until at last
he thought of young Arthur of the Round Table who recently had been
crowned king. So Leodogran sent for Arthur beseeching him to come and
help him, for between the men and the beasts his country was dying.

[Illustration: PRINCESS GUINEVERE.]

King Arthur and his men welcomed the chance and went at once into the
Land of Cameliard to drive away the heathen marauders. As he marched
with his men past the castle walls, pretty Princess Guinevere stood
outside to watch the glittering soldiers go by. Among so many richly
dressed knights she did not particularly notice Arthur, for he wore
nothing to show that he was king, although his kingly bearing and brave
forehead might suggest leadership. But no royal arms were engraved upon
his helmet or his shield, and he carried simple weapons not nearly so
gorgeously emblazoned as those of some of the others.

[Illustration: HE LED HIS WARRIORS BOLDLY.]

Although Guinevere did not see the fair young King, Arthur spied her
beside the castle wall; he felt the light of her beautiful eyes
glimmering out into his heart and setting it all aflame with a fire of
love for her.

He led his warriors boldly to the forests where they pitched their
tents, then fought all the heathen until they scampered away to their
own territories, he slew the frightful wild beasts that had plundered
the fields, cut down the forest trees so as to open out roads for the
people of Cameliard to pass over from one part of their land to the
other, then he traveled quietly away with his men, back to fight his own
battles in his own country. For there was fighting everywhere in those
days. But all the time in Arthur's heart, while he was doing those
wonderful things for Leodogran, he was thinking still, not of Leodogran,
but of the lovely Guinevere, and yearning for her.

If only she could be his queen he thought they two together could rule
on his throne as one strong, sweet, delicious life, and could exert a
mighty power over all his people to make them good and wise and happy.
Each day increased his love until he could not bear even to think for a
moment of living without her. So from the very field of battle, while
the swords were flashing and clashing about him, as he fought the barons
and great lords who had risen up against him, Arthur dispatched three
messengers to Leodogran, the King of Cameliard.

These three messengers were Ulfius, Brastias and Bedivere, the very
first knight Arthur had knighted upon his throne. They went to Leodogran
and said that if Arthur had been of any service to him in his recent
troubles with the heathen and the wild beasts, he should give the
Princess Guinevere to be Arthur's wife as a mark of his good will.

[Illustration: ARTHUR DISPATCHED THREE MESSENGERS TO LEODOGRAN.]

Well, when they had said this, Leodogran did not know what to do any
better than when the heathen and the beasts had come upon him. For while
he thought Arthur a very bold soldier and a very fine man, and, although
he felt very grateful indeed to him for all the great things he had
done, still he was not certain that Guinevere ought to marry him. For,
as Guinevere was the daughter of a king she should become the wife of
none but the son of a king. And Leodogran did not know precisely who
this King Arthur was; but he did know that the barons of Arthur's court
had burst out into this uproar against him because they said he was not
their true king and not the son of King Uther who had reigned before
him. Some of them declared him to be the child of Gerlois, and others
avowed that Sir Anton was his father.

As poor, puzzled Leodogran knew nothing about the matter himself, he
sent for his gray-headed trusty old chamberlain, who always had good
counsel to give him in any dilemma; and he asked the chamberlain whether
he had heard anything certainly as to Arthur's birth. The chamberlain
told him that there were just two men in all the world who knew the
truth with respect to Arthur and where he had come from, and that both
these men were twice as old as himself. One of them was Merlin the
wizard, the other was Bleys, Merlin's teacher in magic, who had written
a book of his renowned pupil's wonders, which probably related
everything regarding the secret of Arthur's birth.

"If King Arthur had done no more for me in my wars than you have just
now in my present trouble," the king answered the chamberlain, "I would
have died long ago from the wild beasts and the heathen. Send me in
Ulfius and Brastias and Bedivere again."

So the chamberlain went out and Arthur's three men came into Leodogran
who spoke to them this way: "I have often seen a big cuckoo chased by
little birds and understood why such tiny birds plagued him so, but why
are the nobles in your country rebelling against their king and saying
that he is not the son of a king. Tell me whether you yourselves think
he is the child of King Uther."

[Illustration: SIR KING, THERE ARE ALL SORTS OF STORIES ABOUT THAT.]

Ulfius and Brastias answered immediately "yes," but Bedivere, the first
of all Arthur's knights, became very bold when anyone slandered his
sovereign and he replied: "_Sir King, there are all sorts of stories
about that_; some of the nobles hate him just because he is good and
they are wicked; they cry out that he is no man because his ways are
gentler than their rough manners, while others again think he must be
an angel dropped from heaven. But I will tell you the facts as I know
them, King Uther and Gerlois were rivals long ago; they both loved
Ygerne. And she was the wife of Gerlois and had no sons, but three
daughters, one of them the Queen of Orkney who has clung to Arthur like
a sister. The two rivals, Gerlois and Uther went to war with each other
and Gerlois was killed in battle; then Uther quickly married the winsome
Ygerne, the widow of Gerlois, for he loved her dearly and impatiently.
In a few months Uther died, and on that very night of his death Arthur
was born. And as soon as he was born they carried him out by a secret
back gateway to Merlin the magician, to be brought up far away from the
court so that no one would hear about him until he was grown up ready to
sit upon Uther's, his father, throne.

"For those were wild lords in those years just like these of today,
always struggling for the rule, and they would have shattered the
helpless little prince to pieces had they known about him. So Merlin
took the baby and gave him over to old Sir Anton, a friend of Uther's,
and Sir Anton's wife tended Arthur with her own little ones so that
nobody knew who he was or where he had come from. But while the prince
was growing up the kingdom went to weed; the great lords and barons were
fighting all the time among themselves and nobody ruled. But during this
present year Arthur's time for ascending the throne had come, so Merlin
brought him from out of his hiding place, set him in the palace hall and
cried out to all the lords and ladies, 'This is Uther's heir, your
king!' Of course, none of them would have that. A hundred voices cried
back immediately: 'Away with him! he is no king of ours, that's the son
of Gerlois, or else the child of Anton, and no king.'

"In spite of this opposition Merlin was so crafty and clever he won the
day for the people, who were clamoring for a king and were glad to see
Arthur crowned. But after it all was over the lords banded together and
broke out in open war against Arthur. That is the whole story of this
war."

Although pleased with Bedivere's good account of Arthur, yet when it was
ended Leodogran scarcely felt satisfied. Was Bedivere right, he thought
to himself, or were the barons right? As he sat pondering over
everything in his palace, _three great visitors came to the castle_;
these were the Queen of Orkney, the daughter of Gerlois and Ygerne, with
her two sons, Gawain and Modred. Leodogran made a great feast for them
and while entertaining them at table remembered what Bedivere had said
about Arthur and this queen. So he turned to the queen and remarked:

[Illustration: THREE VISITORS TO THE CASTLE.]

"An insecure throne is no better than a mass of ice in a summer's sea;
it all melts away. You are from Arthur's court; tell me, do you think
this king with his few loyal Knights of the Round Table can triumph over
the rebellious lords, and keep his throne?"

"O King, they are few indeed," the Queen of Orkney cried, "but so bold
and true, and all of one mind with him. I was there at the coronation
when the savage yells of the nobles died away, and Arthur sat crowned
upon the dais with all his knights gathered round him to do his service
for him forever. Arthur in low, deep tones, with simple words of great
authority bound them to him with such wonderfully rigid vows that when
they rose from their knees one after the other, some of them looked as
pale as if a ghost had passed by them, others were flushed in their
faces, and yet others seemed dazed and blind with their awe as if not
fully awake. Then he spoke to them, cheering them with divine words that
are far more than my tongue can ever tell you, and while he spoke every
face flashed, for just a moment with his likeness, and from the crucifix
above, three rays in green, blue, scarlet, streamed across upon the
bright, sweet faces of the three tall fair queens, his friends who stood
silently beside his throne, and who will always be ready to help him if
he is in need.

"Merlin, the magician, came there too, with his hundred years of art
like so many hands of vassals to wait upon the young king. Near Merlin
stood the mystical, marvelous Lady of the Lake, who knows a deeper magic
than Merlin's own, dressed in white. A mist of incense curled all about
her and her face was fairly hidden in the dim gloom. But when the holy
hymns were sung a voice like flowing waters sounded through the music.
It was the voice of the Lady of the Lake who lives in the lowest waters
of the lake where it is always calm, no matter what storms may blow over
the earth and who when the waves tumble and roll above her can walk out
upon their crests just as our Lord did.

"_It was she who gave Arthur his remarkable sword_ Excalibur, with its
hilt like a cross wherewith he drove away the heathen for you. That
strange sword rose up from out the bosom of the lake, and Arthur rowed
over in a little boat and took it. The sword is incrusted with rich
jewels on the hilt, with a blade so bright that men are blinded by it.
On one side the words 'Take me' are graven upon it in the oldest
language of the world, while on the other side the words 'Cast me away'
are carved in the tongue that you speak.

[Illustration: SHE GAVE ARTHUR HIS REMARKABLE SWORD]

"Arthur became very sad when he saw the second inscription, but Merlin
advised him to take the beautiful blade and use it; he told him that now
was the time to strike and that the time to cast away was very, very far
off. So Arthur took the tremendous sword and with it he will beat down
his enemies, King Leodogran."

Leodogran was pleased with the queen's words, but he wished to test the
story Bedivere had told him, so he looked into her eyes narrowly as he
observed, with a question in his tones, "The swallow and the swift are
very near kin, but you are still closer to this noble prince as you are
his own dear sister."

"I am the daughter of Gerlois and Ygerne," she answered.

"Yes, that is why you are Arthur's sister," the king returned still
questioningly.

"These are secret things," the Queen of Orkney replied, and she motioned
with her hand for her two sons to leave her alone in the room with the
king.

Gawain immediately skipped away singing, his hair flying after and
frolicked outside like a frisky pony, _but cunning Modred laid his ear
close beside the door to listen_, so that he half heard all the strange
story his mother told the king. This is what the queen said in the
beginning to the king.

[Illustration: CUNNING MODRED BESIDE THE DOOR TO LISTEN]

"What should I know about it? For my mother's hair and eyes were dark,
and so were the eyes and hair of Gerlois, and Uther was dark too, almost
black, but the King Arthur is fairer than anyone else in Britain.
However, I remember how my mother used often to weep and say, 'O that
you had some brother, pretty little one, to guard you from the rough
ways of the world."

"Yes? She said that?" Leodogran rejoined, "but when did you see Arthur
first?"

"O king, I will tell you all about it," cried the Queen of Orkney. "Once
when I was a little bit of a girl and had been beaten for some childish
fault that I had not committed, I ran outside and flung myself on a
grassy bank and hated all the world and everything in it, and wished I
were dead. But all of a sudden little Arthur stood by my side. I don't
know how he came or anything about it. Perhaps Merlin brought him, for
Merlin, they say, can walk about and nobody see him, if he will, but any
rate, Arthur was there by my side, comforting me and drying my tears.
After that Arthur came very often without anybody knowing it and we were
children together, and in those golden days I felt sure he would be
king.

"But now I must tell you about Bleys, the old wizard who taught the
magician Merlin. You know they both served King Uther, and just a little
while ago when Bleys died he sent for me. He said he had something to
tell me that I must know before he left the world. He said that they
two, Merlin and he, sat beside the bed of King Uther on the night when
the king passed away, moaning and wailing because he left no heir to his
throne. After the king's death as Merlin and Bleys walked out from the
castle walls into the dismal misty night, they saw a wonderful
fairy-ship shaped like a winged dragon sailing the heavens, with shining
people collected on its decks; but in the twinkling of an eye the ship
was gone.

"Then Merlin and Bleys passed down into the cove by the seashore to
watch the billows, one after the other, as they lapped up against the
beach. And as they looked at last a great wave gathered up one-half of
the ocean and came full of voices, slowly rising and plunging, roaring
all the while. Then all the wave was in a flame; and down in the wave
and in the flame they saw lying a naked babe that was carried by the
water to Merlin's very feet.

"'The king!' cried Merlin. 'Here's an heir for Uther.'

"Then as old Merlin spoke the fringe of that terrible great flaming
breaker lashed at him as he held up the baby; it rose up round him in a
mantle of fire so that he and the child were clothed in fire. Then
suddenly there was a calm, the stars looked out and the sky was open.

"'And this same child,' Bleys whispered to me, 'is the young king who
reigns. And I could not die in peace unless the story had been told.'
Then Bleys passed away into the land where nobody can question him.

"So I came to Merlin to ask him whether that was all true about the
shining dragon-ship and the tiny bare baby floating down from heaven
over on the glory of the seas; but Merlin just laughed, as he always
does, and answered me in the riddles of the old song, this way:

    "'Rain, rain and sun! a rainbow in the sky!
    A young man will be wiser by and by;
    An old man's wit may wander ere he die.
    Rain, rain and sun! a rainbow on the lea!
    And truth is this to me and that to thee;
    And truth or clothed or naked let it be.
    Rain, sun and rain! and the free blossom blows;
    Sun, rain and sun! and where is he who knows.
    From the great deep to the great deep he goes!'

"It vexed me dreadfully to have Merlin be so tantalizing; but you must
not be afraid, king, to give your only child Guinevere to this King
Arthur. For great poets will sing of his brave deeds in long years after
this; and Merlin has said, and not joking, either, that even although
Arthur's enemies may wound him in battle he will never, never die, but
will only pass away for a time, for a little while, and then will come
to us again. And Merlin says too, that sometime Arthur is going to
trample all the heathen kings under his feet until all the nations and
all the men will call him their king."

It pleased Leodogran tremendously to hear what the Queen of Orkney told
him of Arthur, and when she had ended he lay thinking over it all, still
puzzled as to whether he should say "yes" or "no" to the ambassadors
whom Arthur had sent. As he lay buried in his thoughts he grew very,
very drowsy and dreamy, and at last, he fell asleep. And while he slept
he saw a wonderful vision in a dream.

There was a strange, sloping land, rising before his eyes, that ascended
higher and higher, field after field, to a very great height and at the
top there was a lofty peak hidden in the heavy, hazy clouds; and on the
peak a phantom king stood. One moment the king was there, and the next
moment he was gone, while everything below him was in a frightful
confusion, a battle with swords, and the flocks of sheep and cattle
falling back, and all the villages burning and their smoke rolling up in
streams to the clouded pinnacle of the peak where the king stood in the
fog, hiding him the more. Now and then the king spoke out through the
haze, and some one here or there beneath would point upward toward him,
but the rest all went on fighting. They cried out, "He is no king of
ours, no son of Uther's, no king of ours." Then in a twinkling the dream
all changed; the mists had quite blown away, the solid earth below the
peak had vanished like a bubble and only the wonderful king remained,
crowned with his diadems, standing in the heavens.

Then Leodogran while still looking at him woke from his sleep. He called
for Ulfius and Brastias and Bedevere, and when they had come into this
presence he told them that Arthur should marry the fair Princess
Guinevere, and he sent them galloping back to Arthur's court.

That was a joyful day for King Arthur when the three knights delivered
King Leodogran's message. He made ready at once for his sweet queen. He
picked out Lancelot, his favorite Knight of the Round Table, whom he
loved better than any other man in all the world, to ride over into the
Land of Cameliard and bring back Guinevere for his bride. And as
Lancelot mounted his dancing steed and rode away _Arthur watched him
from the palace gates_, thinking of the lovely lady who would ride by
his side when he returned.

[Illustration: LANCELOT MOUNTED HIS DANCING STEED.]

Lancelot's horse trampled away among the flowers; for it was April when
he left the court of Arthur, and just one month later he came riding
back among the flowers of the May-time. Guinevere was with him on her
graceful palfrey.

Then Dubric, the head of the whole church in Britain, went out to meet
her. Happy Arthur was there too. They were married in the greatest and
noblest church in the land before the stately altar, with all the
Knights of the Round Table dressed in stainless white clothes, gathered
about them. And all the knights were as delighted as they could be
because their king was so glad. Holy Dubric spread out his hands above
the King and the lovely Queen to call down the blessings of heaven, and
he said:

[Illustration: KING ARTHUR AND THE LOVELY QUEEN.]

"Reign, King, and live and love, and make the world better, and may your
queen be one with you, and may all the Knights of the Order of the Round
Table fulfill the boundless purposes of their king."

There was spread a glorious marriage feast. Great lords came thither
from far away Rome, which once was the mistress of all the world, but
now was slowly fading away. These Roman lords called for the tribute
from Arthur that they had always received from Britain ever since Caesar
with his Roman legions had conquered it long years before.

But Arthur, the king and bridegroom, pointed to his snowy knights and
said: "These knights of mine have sworn to fight for me in all my wars
and to worship me as their king. The old order of things has passed away
and a new order will take its place. We are fighting for our fair father
Christ, while you have been growing so feeble and so weak and so old
that you cannot even drive away the heathen from your Roman walls any
more. So we will not pay tribute to you nor be your slaves. This is to
be our own free country which we will defend and maintain."

_The great lords from Rome drew back very angrily_ and went home and
told their king all about what Arthur had said. So Arthur had to battle
with Rome, but he won in the end.

Arthur trained his Knights of the Round Table so that they all felt like
one great, vast strong man, all of one will. Thus he became mightier
than any of the other kings in any part of Britain. And when he fought
with them he always conquered them. In that way he drew in all the
little kingdoms under him, so that he was the one king of the land, and
they all fought together for him.

There were twelve great battles against the heathen hordes that had
molested them from across the terrible seas, and each of these battles
he won. So he made one great realm and he reigned over it, the king.

[Illustration: THE GREAT LORDS FROM ROME DREW BACK.]




GARETH AND LYNETTE.


Old King Lot and good Queen Bellicent had three sons. Gawain and Modred
were Knights of the Round Table at Arthur's court, and young Gareth, who
was his mother's pet, sighed to think he had to stay home and be cuddled
and fondled like a baby boy instead of riding off like a venturesome
soldier fighting gloriously for the king and winning a great name.

"There!" he cried impatiently, one chilly spring day as he stood by the
brink of a rivulet and saw a bit of a pine tree caught from the bank by
the dashing, swollen waters of the stream and whirled madly away.
"That's the way the king's enemies would fall before my spear, if I had
a spear to use! That stream can do no more than I can, even although it
is merely icy water all cold with the snows while I'm tingling with hot
blood and have strong arms. When Gawain came home last summer and asked
me to tilt with him and Modred was the judge, didn't I shake him so in
his saddle that he said I had half overcome him? Humph! and mother
thinks I'm still a child!"

_Gareth went in to the queen_ and said: "Mother, if you love me listen
to a story I will tell. Once there was an egg which a great royal eagle
laid high above on the rocks somewhere almost out of sight and there was
a lad which saw the splendor sparkling from it, and the lightnings
playing around it and the little birds crying and clashing in the nest.
The boy thought if he could only reach that egg he would be richer than
a houseful of kings, and he was nearly driven from his sense with his
desire for it. But whenever he reached to clamber up for it some one who
loved him restrained him saying, 'If you love me do not climb, lest
you break your neck.' So the boy did not climb, mother, and he did not
break his neck, but he broke his heart pining for the glorious egg. How
can you keep me tethered here, Mother? Let me go!"

[Illustration: MOTHER, IF YOU LOVE ME LISTEN TO A STORY I WILL TELL.]

"Have you no pity for me?" Queen Bellicent asked. "Stay here by your
poor old father and me; chase the deer in our fir trees and marry some
lovely bride I will get for you. You're my best son and so young."

"Mother, a king once showed his son two brides and told him that he must
either win the beautiful one, or, if he failed, wed the other. The
pretty one was Fame and the other was Shame. Why should I follow the
deer when I can follow the king? Why was I born a man if I cannot do a
man's work?"

"But some of the barons say he isn't the true king."

"Hasn't he conquered the Romans and driven off the heathen and made all
the people free? Who has a right to be king if not the man who has done
that? He is the true king."

When Bellicent found that she could not turn Gareth from his purpose,
she said that if he was determined he must do one thing before he asked
the king to make him a knight.

"Anything," cried Gareth. "Give me a hundred proofs. Only be quick."

The queen looked at him very slowly and said: "You are a prince, Gareth,
but before you are fit to serve the king you must go into Arthur's court
disguised and hire yourself to serve his meats and drink among the
scullions and kitchen knaves. And you must not tell your name to anyone
and you must serve that way for a year and a day."

The queen made this condition, thinking that Gareth would be too proud
to play the slave. But he thought a moment, then answered: "A slave may
be free in his soul, and I can see the jousts there. You are my mother
so I must obey you and I will be a scullion in King Arthur's kitchen and
keep my name a secret from everyone, even the king."

So Bellicent grieved and watched Gareth every moment wherever he went,
dreading the time when he should leave. And he waited until one windy
night when she slept, then called two servants and slipped away with
them, all three dressed like poor peasants of the field.

They walked away towards the south and as they came to the plain
stretching to the mountain of Camelot, they saw the royal city upon its
brow. Sometimes its spires and towers flashed in the sunlight; sometimes
only the great gate shone out before their eyes, or again the whole fair
town vanished away. Then the servants said:

"Let us go no further, Lord. It's an enchanted city, and all a vision.
The people say anyway, that Arthur isn't the true king, but only a
changeling from fairyland, and that Merlin won his battles for him with
magic."

Gareth laughed and replied that he had magic enough in his blood and
hopes to plunge old Merlin into the Arabian sea. And he pushed them on
to the gate. There was no other gate like it under heaven. The Lady of
the Lake stood barefooted on the keystone and held up the cornice. Drops
of water fell from either hand and above were the three queens who were
Arthur's friends, and on each side Arthur's wars were pictured in weird
devices with dragons and elves so intertwined that they made men dizzy
to look at them. The servants cried out, "Lord, the gateway is alive!"
Then a blast of music pealed out of the city, and the three queens
stepped aside while an old man with a long beard came out and asked:

"Who are you, my sons?"

"We are peasants," answered Gareth, "who have come to see the glories of
your king, but the city looked so strange through the morning mist that
my men are wondering whether it is not a fairy city or perhaps no city
at all. So tell us the truth about it."

"Oh, it's a fairy city," the old man answered, "and a fairy king and
queen came out of the mountain cleft at sunrise with harps in their
hands and built it to music, which means it never was built at all, and
therefore built forever."

"Why do you mock me so?" Gareth cried angrily.

"I am not mocking you so much as you are mocking me and every one who
looks at you, for you are not what you seem, still I know what you truly
are."

Then the old man turned away and Gareth said to his men: "Our poor
little white lie stands like a ghost at the very beginning of our
enterprise. Blame my mother's love for it and not her nor me."

So they all laughed and came into the city of Camelot with its shadowy
and stately palaces. Here and there a knight passed in or out, his arms
clashing and the sound was good to Gareth's ears. Or out of a casement
window glanced the pure eyes of lovely women. But Gareth made at once
for the hall of the king where his heart fairly hammered into his ears
as he wondered whether Arthur would turn him aside because of the half
shadow of a lie he had told the old man by the gate about being a
peasant. There were many supplicants coming before the king to tell him
of some hurt done them by marauders or the wild beasts, and each one was
given a knight by the king to help them.

When Gareth's turn came, he rested his arms, one on each servant, and
stepped forward saying: "A boon, Sir King! Do you see how weak I seem,
leaning on these men? Pray let me go into your kitchen and serve there
for a year and a day, and do not ask me my name. After that I will fight
for you."

"You are a handsome youth," said the king, "and worth something better
from the king, but if that is what you wish, go and serve under the
seneschal, Sir Kay, Master of the Meats and Drinks."

Sir Kay thought the boy had probably run away from the farm belonging to
some Abbey where he had not had enough to eat, and he promised that if
Gareth would work well he would feed him until he was as plump as a
pigeon.

But Lancelot, the king's favorite, said to Kay: "You don't understand
boys as well as dogs and cattle. Can't you see by this lad's broad fair
forehead and fine hands that he is nobly born? Treat him well or he may
shame you."

"Fair and fine, forsooth," cried Kay. "If he had been a gentleman he
would have asked for a horse and armor."

So he hustled and harried Garreth, _set him to draw water_, _hew wood_
and labor harder than any of the grimy and smudgy kitchen knaves. Gareth
did all with a noble sort of ease and graced the lowliest act, and when
the knaves all gathered together of an evening to tell stories about
Arthur on the battlefields or of Lancelot in the tournament, Gareth
listened delightedly or made them all, with gaping mouths, listen
charmed, to some prodigious tale of his own about wonderful knights
cutting their scarlet way through twenty folds of twisted dragons. When
there was a Joust and Sir Kay let him attend it, he went half beside
himself in an ecstasy watching the warriors clash their springing
spears, and the sniffing chargers reel.

At the end of the first month, lonely Queen Bellicent felt sorry for her
poor, dear son, toiling and moiling among pots and pans, so she sent a
servant to Camelot with the beaming armor of a knight and freed him from
his vow. Gareth colored redder than any young girl and went alone in to
the king and told him all.

[Illustration: SET HIM TO DRAW WATER, HEW WOOD.]

"Make me your knight in secret," he begged Arthur, "and give me the very
next quest from your court!"

"Son," answered the king, "my knights are sworn to vows of utter
hardihood, of utter gentleness, of utter faithfulness in love and of
utter obedience to the king."

Gareth sprang lightly from his knees: "My king, I can promise you for my
hardihood; respecting my obedience, ask Sir Kay, and as for love I have
not loved yet, but God willing some day I will, and faithfully."

The reply so pleased the great king, he laid his hand on Gareth's arm
and smiled and knighted him.

A few days later _a noble maiden_ with a brow like a May-blossom and a
saucy nose _passed into the king's hall with her page_ and told Arthur
that her name was Lynette, and that her beautiful sister, the Lady
Lyonors lived in the Castle Perilous which was beset with bandit
knights.

[Illustration: A NOBLE MAIDEN WITH HER PAGE.]

"A river courses about the castle in three loops," said she, "each loop
has a bridge and every bridge is guarded by a wicked outlaw warrior, Sir
Morning-star, Sir Noon-sun and Sir Evening-star, while a fourth called
Death, a huge man-beast of boundless savageries, is besieging my sister
in her own castle so as to break her will and make her wed with him.
They are four fools," cried the maiden disdainfully, "but they are
mighty men so I have come to ask for Lancelot to ride away with me to
help us."

Gareth was up in a twinkling with kindled eyes. "A boon, Sir King, this
quest," he cried. "I am only a knave from your kitchen, but I can
topple over a hundred such fellows. Your promise, king."

"You are rough and sudden and worthy to be a knight. Therefore go," said
Arthur to the great amazement of the court.

"Fie on you, King!" exclaimed Lynette in a fury. "I asked you for your
best knight, Lancelot, and you give me a slave from your kitchen," and
she scampered down the aisle, leaped to her horse and flitted out of the
weird white gate. "A kitchen slave!" she sputtered as she flew. "Why
didn't the king send me a knight that fights for love and glory?"

Gareth in the meantime had strode to the side doorway of the royal hall
where he saw a war-horse awaiting him, the gift of Arthur and worth half
the price of a town. His two servants stood by with his shield and
helmet and spear. Dropping his coarse kitchen cloak to the floor, he
instantly harnessed himself in his armor, leaped to the back of his
beautiful steed and flashed out of the gateway while all his kitchen
mates threw up their caps and cried, "God bless the king and all his
fellowship!"

"Maiden, the quest is mine," he said to Lynette as he overtook her,
"Lead and I follow."

"Away with you!" she cried, nipping her slender nose. "You smell of
kitchen grease. See there, your master is coming!"

Indeed she told the truth, for Sir Kay, infuriated with Gareth's
boldness in the king's hall was hounding after them. "Don't you know
me?" he shouted.

"Yes, too well," returned Gareth. "I know you to be the most ungentle
knight in Arthur's court."

"Have at me, then," cried Kay, whereupon Gareth pounced upon him with
his gleaming lance and struck him instantly to the earth, then turned
for Lynette and said again, "Lead and I follow."

But Lynette had hurried her galloping palfrey away and would not stop
the beast until his heart had nearly burst with its violent throbbing.
Then she turned and eyed Gareth as scornfully as ever. As he pranced to
her side she observed:

"Do you suppose scullion, that I think any more of you now that by some
good luck you have overthrown your master. You dishwasher and
water-carrier, you smell of the kitchen quite as much as before."

"Maiden," Gareth rejoined gently, "Say what you will, but whatever you
say, I will not leave this quest until it is ended or I have died for
it."

"O, my, how the knave talks! But you'll soon meet with another knave
whom in spite of all the kitchen concoctions ever brewed, you'll not
dare look in the face."

"I'll try him," answered Gareth with a smile that maddened Lynette. And
away she darted again far into the strange avenues of the limitless
woods.

Gareth plunged on through the pine trees after her and a serving-man
came breaking through the black forest crying out, "They've bound my
master and are throwing him into the lake!"

"Lead and I follow," cried Gareth to Lynette, and she led, plunging into
the pine trees until they came upon a hollow sinking away into a lake,
where six tall men up to their thighs in reeds and bulrushes were
dragging a seventh man with a stone about his neck toward the water to
drown him.

Gareth sprang upon three and stilled them with his doughty blows, but
three scurried away through the trees; then Gareth loosened the stone
from the gentleman and set him on his feet. He proved to be a baron and
a friend of Arthur and asked Gareth what he could do to show his
gratitude for the saving of his life. Gareth said he would like a
night's shelter for the lady who was with him. So they rode over toward
the graceful manor house where the baron lived, and as they rode he said
to Gareth.

"I believe you are of the Table," meaning that Gareth was a Knight of
the Round Table.

"Yes, he is of the table after his own fashion," Lynette laughed, "for
he serves in Arthur's kitchen." And turning toward Gareth she added, "Do
not imagine that I admire you the more for having routed these miserable
cowardly foresters; any thresher with his flail could have done that."

And when they were seated at the baron's table, Gareth by Lynette's
side, she cried out to their host, "It seems dreadfully rude in you,
Lord Baron, to place this knave beside me. Listen to me: I went to King
Arthur's court to ask for Sir Lancelot to come to help my sister, and as
I ended my plea, up bawls this kitchen boy: 'Mine's the quest.' And
Arthur goes mad and sends me this fellow who was made to kill pigs and
not redress the wrongs of women."

So Gareth was seated at another table and the baron came to him and
asked him whether it might not be better for him to relinquish his
quest, but the lad replied that the king had given it to him and he
would carry it through. The next morning he said again to proud Lynette,
"Lead and I follow."

But the maiden responded, "We are almost at the place where one of the
knaves is stationed. Don't you want to go home? He will slay you and
then I'll go back to Arthur and shame him for giving me a knight from
his kitchen cinders."

"Just let me fight," cried Gareth, "and I'll have as good luck as little
Cinderella who married the prince."

So they came to the first coil of the river and on the other side saw a
rich white pavilion with a purple dome and a slender crimson flag
fluttering above. The lawless Sir Morning-star paced up and down
outside.

"Damsel, is this the knight you've brought me?" he shouted.

"Not a knight, but a knave. The king scorned you so he sent some one
from his kitchen."

"Come Daughters of the Dawn and arm me!" cried Sir Morning-star, and
three bare-footed, bare-headed maidens in pink and gold dresses brought
him a blue coat of mail and a blue shield.

"A kitchen knave in scorn of me!" roared the blue knight. "I won't fight
him. Go home, knave! It isn't proper for you to be riding abroad with a
lady."

"Dog, you lie! I'm sprung from nobler lineage than you," and saying
this, Gareth sprang fiercely at his adversary who met him in the middle
of the bridge. The two spears were hurled so harshly that both knights
were thrown from their horses like two stones but up they leaped
instantly. Gareth drew forth his sword and drove his enemy back down the
bridge and laid him at his feet.

"I yield," Sir Morning-star cried, "don't kill me."

"Your life is in the hands of this lady," Gareth replied. "If she asks
me to spare you I will."

"Scullion!" Lynette cried, reddening with shame. "Do you suppose I will
ask a favor of you?"

"Then he dies," and Gareth was about to slay the wounded knight when
Lynette screamed and told him he ought not to think of killing a man of
nobler birth than himself. So Gareth said, "Knight, your life is spared
at this lady's command. Go to King Arthur's court and tell him that his
kitchen knave sent you, and crave his pardon for breaking his laws."

"I thought the smells of the odors of the kitchen grew fainter while you
were fighting on the bridge," Lynette remarked to Gareth as he took his
place behind her and told her to lead, "but now they are as strong as
ever."

So they rode on until they arrived at the second loop of the river where
the knight of the Noonday-Sun flared with his burning shield that blazed
so violently that Gareth saw scarlet blots before his eyes as he turned
away from it.

"Here's a kitchen knave from Arthur's hall who has overthrown your
brother," Lynette called across the river to him.

"Ugh!" returned Sir Noonday-Sun, raising his visor to reveal his round
foolish face like a cipher, and with that he pushed his horse into the
foaming stream.

Gareth met him midway and struck him four blows of his sword. As he was
about to deal the fifth stroke the horse of the Noonday-Sun slipped and
the stream washed his dazzling master away. Gareth plucked him out of
the water and sent him back to King Arthur.

"Lead and I follow," he said to Lynette.

"Do not fancy," she rejoined, as she guided him toward the third passing
of the river, "that I thought you bold or brave when you overcame Sir
Noonday-Sun; he just slipped on the river-bed. Here we are at the third
fool in the allegory, Sir Evening-star. You see he looks naked but he is
only wrapped in hardened skins that fit him like his own. They will turn
the blade of your sword."

"Never mind," Gareth said, "the wind may turn again and the kitchen
odors grow faint."

Then Lynette called to the Evening-star:

"Both of your brothers have gone down before this youth and so will you.
Aren't you old?"

"Old with the strength of twenty boys," said Sir Evening-star.

"Old in boasting," Gareth cried, "but the same strength that slew your
brothers can slay you."

Then the Evening-star blew a deadly note upon his horn and a
storm-beaten, russet, grizzly old woman came out and armed him in a
quantity of dingy weapons. The two knights clashed together on the
bridge and Gareth brought the Evening-star groveling in a minute to his
feet on his knees. But the other vaulted up again so quickly that Gareth
panted and half despaired of winning the victory.

Then Lynette cried: "Well done, knave; you are as noble as any knight.
Now do not shame me; I said you would win. Strike! strike! and the wind
will change again."

Gareth struck harder, he hewed great pieces of armor from the old
knight, but clashed in vain with his sword against the hard skin, until
at last he lashed the Evening-star's sword and broke it at the hilt. "I
have you now!" he shouted, but the cowardly knight of the Evening-star
writhed his arms about the lad till Gareth was almost strangled. Yet
straining himself to the uttermost he finally _tossed his foe headlong
over the side of the bridge_ to sink or to swim as the waves allowed.

"Lead and I follow," Gareth said to Lynette.

"No, it is lead no longer," the maiden replied. "Ride beside me the
knightliest of all kitchen knaves. Sir I am ashamed that I have treated
you so. Pardon me. I do wonder who you are, you knave."

"You are not to blame for anything," Gareth said, "except for your
mistrusting of the king when he sent you some one to defend you. You
said what you thought and I answered by my actions."

At that moment he heard the hoofs of a horse clattering in the road
behind him. "Stay!" cried a knight with a veiled shield, "I have come to
avenge my friend, Sir Kay."

Gareth turned, and in a thrice had closed in upon the stranger, but when
he felt the touch of the stranger knight's magical spear, which was the
wonder of the world he fell to the earth. As he felt the grass in his
hands he burst into laughter.

[Illustration: TOSSED HIS FOE OVER THE SIDE OF THE BRIDGE.]

"Why do you laugh?" asked Lynette.

"Because here am I, the son of old King Lot and good Queen Bellicent,
the victor of the three bridges, and a knight of Arthur's thrown by no
one knows whom."

"I have come to help you and not harm you," said the strange knight,
revealing himself. It was Lancelot, whom King Arthur had sent to keep a
guardian eye upon young Gareth in this his first quest, to prevent him
from being killed or taken away.

"And why did you refuse to come when I wanted you, and now come just in
time to shame my poor defender just when I was beginning to feel proud
of him?" asked Lynette.

"But he isn't shamed," Lancelot answered. "What knight is not overthrown
sometimes? By being defeated we learn to overcome, so hail Prince and
Knight of our Round Table!" "You did well Gareth, only you and your
horse were a little weary."

[Illustration: SHE TENDED HIM AS GENTLY AS A MOTHER.]

Lynette led them into a glen and a cave where they found pleasant drinks
and meat, and where Gareth fell asleep.

"You have good reason to feel sleepy," cried Lynette. "Sleep soundly and
wake strong." _And she tended him as gently as a mother_, and watched
over him carefully as he slept.

When Gareth woke Lancelot gave him his own horse and shield to use in
fighting the last awful outlaw, but as they drew near Lynette clutched
at the shield and pleaded with him: "Give it back to Lancelot," said
she. "O curse my tongue that was reviling you so today. He must do the
fighting now. You have done wonders, but you cannot do miracles. You
have thrown three men today and that is glory enough. You will get all
maimed and mangled if you go on now when you are tired. There, I vow you
must not try the fourth."

But Gareth told her that her sharp words during the day had just spurred
him on to do his best and he said he must not now leave his quest until
he had finished. So Lancelot advised him how best to manage his horse
and his lance, his sword and his shield when meeting a foe that was
stouter than himself, winning with fineness and skill where he lacked in
strength.

But Gareth replied that he knew but one rule in fighting and that was to
dash against his foe and overcome him.

"Heaven help you," cried Lynette, and she made her palfrey halt.
"There!" They were facing the camp of the Knight of Death.

There was a huge black pavilion, a black banner and a black horn. Gareth
blew the horn and heard hollow tramplings to and fro and muffled voices.
Then on a night-black horse, in night-black arms rode forth the dread
warrior. A white breast-bone showed in front. He spoke not a word which
made him the more fearful.

"Fool!" shouted Gareth sturdily. "People say that you have the strength
of ten men; can't you trust to it without depending on these toggeries
and tricks?"

But the Knight of Death said nothing. Lady Lyonors at her castle window
wept, and one of her maids fainted away, and Gareth felt his head
prickling beneath his helmet and Lancelot felt his blood turning cold.
Every one stood aghast.

Then the chargers bounded forward and Gareth struck Death to the ground.
Drawing out his sword he split apart the vast skull; one half of it fell
to the right and one half to the left. Then he was about to strike at
the helmet when out of it peeped the face of a blooming young boy, as
fresh as a flower.

"O Knight!" cried the laddie. "Do not kill me. My three brothers made me
do it to make a horror all about the castle. They never dreamed that
anyone could pass the bridges."

Then Lady Lyonors with all her house had a great party of dancing and
revelry and song and making merry because the hideous Knight of Death
that had terrified them so was only a pretty little boy. And there was
mirth over Gareth's victorious quest.

And some people say that Gareth married Lynette, but others who tell the
story later say he wedded with Lyonors.




THE MARRIAGE OF GERAINT.


King Arthur had come to the old city of Caerleon on the River Usk to
hold his court, and was sitting high in his royal hall when a woodman,
all bedraggled with the mists of the forests came tripping up in haste
before his throne.

"O noble King," he cried, "today I saw a wonderful deer, a hart all
milky white running through among the trees, and, nothing like it has
ever been seen here before."

The king, who loved the chase, was very pleased and immediately gave
orders that the royal horns should be blown for all the court to go a
hunting after the beautiful white deer the following morning. Queen
Guinevere wished to go with them to watch the hounds and huntsmen and
dancing horses in the chase. She slept late, however, the next day with
her pleasant dreams, and Arthur with his Knights of the Round Table had
sped gloriously away on their snorting chargers when she arose, called
one of her maids to come with her, mounted her palfrey and forded the
River Usk to pass over by the forest.

[Illustration: A WOODMAN ALL BEDRAGGLED CAME IN HASTE BEFORE HIS
THRONE.]

There they climbed up on a little knoll and stood listening for the
hounds, but instead of the barking of the king's dogs they heard the
sound of a horse's hoofs trampling behind them. It was Prince Geraint's
charger as he flashed over the shallow ford of the river, then galloped
up the banks of the knoll to her side. He carried not a single weapon
except his golden-hilted sword and wore, not his hunting-dress, but gay
holiday silks with a purple scarf about him swinging an apple of gold at
either end and glancing like a dragon-fly. He bowed low to the sweet,
stately queen.

"You're late, very late, Sir Prince," said she, "later even than we."

"Yes, noble queen," replied Geraint, "I'm so late that I'm not going to
the hunt; I've come like you just to watch it."

"Then stay with me," the queen said, "for here on this little knoll, if
anywhere, you will have a good chance to see the hounds, often they dash
by at its very feet."

So Geraint stood by the queen, thinking he would catch particularly the
baying of Cavall, Arthur's loudest dog, which would tell him that the
hunters were coming. As they waited however, along the base of the
knoll, came a knight, a lady and a dwarf riding slowly by on their
horses. The knight wore his visor up showing his imperious and very
haughty young face. The dwarf lagged behind.

"That knight doesn't belong to the Round Table, does he?" asked the
queen. "I don't know him."

"No, nor I," replied Geraint.

So the queen sent her maid over to the dwarf to find out the name of his
master. But the dwarf was old and crotchety and would not tell her.

"Then I'll ask your master himself," cried the maid.

"No, indeed, you shall not!" cried the dwarf, "you are not fit even to
speak of him," and as the girl turned her horse to approach the proud
young knight, the misshapen little dwarf of a servant struck at her with
his whip, and she came scampering back indignantly to the queen.

[Illustration: HE STRUCK OUT HIS WHIP AND CUT THE PRINCE'S CHEEK.]

"I'll learn his name for you," Geraint exclaimed, and he rode off
sharply.

But the impudent dwarf answered just as before and when Prince Geraint
moved on toward his master he struck out his whip and cut the prince's
cheek so that the blood streamed upon the purple scarf dyeing it red.
Instantly Geraint reached for the hilt of his sword to strike down the
vicious little midget but then remembering that he was a prince and
disdaining to fight with a dwarf, he did not even say a word, but
cantered back to Queen Guinevere's side.

"Noble Queen," he cried fiercely. "I am going to avenge this insult that
has been done you. I'll track these vermin to the earth. For even
although I am riding unarmed just now, as we go along I will come to
some place where I can borrow weapons or hire them. And then when I have
my man I'll fight him, and on the third day from today I'll be back
again unless I die in the fight. So good-bye, farewell."

"Farewell, handsome prince," the queen answered. "Good fortune in your
quest and may you live to marry your first love whoever that may be. But
whether she will be a princess or a beggar from the hedgerows, before
you wed with her bring her back to me and I will robe her for her
wedding day."

Prince Geraint bowed and with that he was off. One minute he thought he
heard the noble milk-white deer brought to bay by the dogs, the next he
thought he heard the hunter's horn far away and felt a little vexed to
think he must be following this stupid dwarf while all the others were
at the chase. But he had determined to avenge the queen and up and down
the grassy glades and valleys pursued the three enemies until at last at
sundown they emerged from the forest, climbed up on the ridge of a hill
where they looked like shadows against the dark sky, then sank again on
the other side.

Below on the other side of the ridge ran the long street of a clamoring
little town in a long valley, on one side a new white fortress and on
the other, across a ravine and a bridge, a fallen old castle in decay.
The knight, the lady and the dwarf rode on to the white fortress, then
vanished within its walls.

"There!" cried Geraint, "now I have him! I have tracked him to his hole,
and tomorrow when I'm rested I'll fight him."

Then he turned wearily down the long street of the noisy village to look
for his night's lodging, but he found every inn and tavern crowded, and
everywhere horses in the stables were being shod and young fellows were
busy burnishing their master's armor.

"What does all this hubbub mean?" asked Geraint of one of these youths.

The lad did not stop his work one instant, but went on scouring and
replied, "It's the sparrow-hawk."

As Prince Geraint did not know what was meant by the sparrow-hawk he
trotted a little farther along the street until he came to a quiet old
man trudging by with a sack of corn on his back.

"Why is your town so noisy and busy to-night, good old fellow?" he
cried.

"Ugh! the sparrow-hawk!" the old fellow said gruffly.

So the prince rode his horse yet a little farther until he saw an
armor-maker's shop. The armor-maker sat inside with his back turned, all
doubled over a helmet which he was riveting together upon his knee.

"Armorer," cried Geraint, "what is going on? Why is there such a din?"

The man did not pause in his riveting even to turn about and face the
stranger, but said quickly as if to finish speaking as rapidly as he
could, "Friend, the people who are working for the sparrow-hawk have no
time for idle questions."

At this Geraint flashed up angrily.

"A fig for your sparrow-hawk! I wish all the bits of birds of the air
would peck him dead. You imagine that this little cackle in your baby
town is all the noise and murmur of the great world. What do I care
about it? It is nothing to me. Listen to me, now, if you are not gone
hawk-mad like the rest, where can I get a lodging for the night, and
more than that, where can I get some arms, arms, arms, to fight my
enemy? Tell me."

The hurrying armor-maker looked about in amazement to see this gorgeous
cavalier in purple silks standing before his bit of a shop.

"O pardon me, stranger knight," said he very politely. "We are holding a
great tournament here tomorrow morning and there is hardly any time to
do one-half the work that has to be finished before then. Arms, did you
say? Indeed I cannot tell you where to get any; all that there are in
this town are needed for to-morrow in the lists. And as for lodging, I
don't know unless perhaps at Earl Yniol's in the old castle across the
bridge." Then he again picked up his helmet and turned his back to the
prince.

So Geraint, still a wee mite vexed, rode over the bridge that spanned
the ravine, to go to the ruined castle. There upon the farther side sat
the hoary-headed Earl Yniol, dressed in some magnificent shabby old
clothes which had been fit for a king's parties when they were new.

"Where are you going, son?" he queried of Geraint, waking from his
reveries and dreaminess.

"O friend, I'm looking for some shelter for the night," Geraint replied.

"Come in then," Yniol said, "and accept of my hospitality. Our house was
rich once and now it is poor, but it always keeps its door open to the
stranger."

"Oh, anything will do for me," cried Geraint. "If only you won't serve
me sparrow-hawks for my supper I'll eat with all the passion of a whole
day's fast."

The old earl smiled and sighed as he rejoined, "I have more serious
reason than you to curse this sparrow-hawk. But go in and we will not
have a word about him even jokingly unless you wish it."

Whereupon Geraint passed into the desolate castle court, where the
stones of the pavement were all broken and overgrown with wild plants,
and the turrets and walls were shattered. As he stood awaiting the Earl
Yniol, the voice of a young girl singing like a nightingale rang out
from one of the open castle windows.

It was the voice of Enid, Earl Yniol's daughter as she sang the song of
Fortune and her Wheel:

    "Turn, Fortune, thy wheel with smile or frown,
    With that wild wheel we go not up or down;
    Our hoard is little, but our hearts are great."

"The song of that little bird describes the nest she lives in," cried
Earl Yniol approaching. "Enter."

Geraint alighted from his charger and stepped within the large dusky
cobwebbed hall, where an aged lady sat, with Enid moving about her, like
a little flower in a wilted sheath of a faded silk gown.

"Enid, the good knight's horse is standing in the court," cried the
earl. "Take him to the stall and give him some corn, then go to town and
buy us some meat and wine."

[Illustration: GERAINT STEPPED WITHIN THE DUSKY COBWEBBED HALL.]

Geraint wished that he might do this servant's work instead of this
pretty young lady, but as he started to follow her the old gray earl
stopped him.

"We're old and poor," he said, "but not so poor and old as to let our
guests wait upon themselves."

So Enid fetched the wine and the meat and the cakes and the bread; and
she served at the table while her mother, father and Geraint sat around.
Geraint wished that he might stoop to kiss her tender little thumb as it
held the platter when she laid it down.

[Illustration: ENID FETCHED THE WINE AND THE MEAT AND THE CAKES.]

"Fair host and Earl," he said after his refreshing supper, "who is this
sparrow-hawk that everybody in the town is talking about? And yet I do
not wish you to give me his name, for perhaps he is the knight I saw
riding into the new fortress the other side of the bridge at the other
end of the town. His name I am going to have from his own lips, for I
am Geraint of Devon. This morning when the queen sent her maid to find
out his name he struck at the girl with his whip, and I've sworn
vengeance for such a great insult done our queen, and have followed him
to his hold, and as soon as I can get arms I will fight him."

"And are you the renowned Geraint?" cried Earl Yniol beaming. "Well, as
soon as I saw you coming toward me on the bridge I knew that you were no
ordinary man. By the state and presence of your bearing I might have
guessed you to be one of Arthur's Knights of the Round Table at Camelot.
Pray do not suppose that I am flattering you foolishly. This dear child
of mine has often heard me telling glorious stories of all the famous
things you have done for the king and the people. And she has asked me
to repeat them again and again.

"Poor thing, there never has lived a woman with such miserable lovers as
she has had. The first was Limours, who did nothing but drink and brawl,
even when he was making love to her. And the second was the
'sparrow-hawk,' my nephew, my curse. I will not let his name slip from
me if I can help it. When I told him that he could not marry my daughter
he spread a false rumour all round here among the people that his father
had left him a great sum of money in my keeping and that I had never
passed it over to him but had retained it for myself. He bribed all my
servants with large promises and stirred up this whole little old town
of mine against me, my own town. That was the night of Enid's birthday
nearly three years ago. They sacked my house, ousted me from my earldom,
threw us into this dilapidated, dingy old place and built up that grand
new white fort. He would kill me if he did not despise me too much to
do so; and sometimes I believe I despise myself for letting him have his
way. I scarcely know whether I am very wise or very silly, very manly or
very base to suffer it all so patiently."

"Well said," cried Geraint eagerly. "But the arms, the arms, where can I
get arms for myself? Then if the sparrow-hawk will fight tomorrow in the
tourney I may be able to bring down his terrible pride a little."

"I have arms," said Yniol, "although they are old and rusty, Prince
Geraint, and you would be welcome to have them for the asking. But in
this tournament of tomorrow no knight is allowed to tilt unless the lady
he loves best come there too. The forks are fastened into the meadow
ground and over them is placed a silver wand, above that a golden
sparrow-hawk, the prize of beauty for the fairest woman there. And
whoever wins in the tourney presents this to the lady-love whom he has
brought with him. Since my nephew is a man of very large bone and is
clever with his lance he has always won it for his lady. That is how he
has earned his title of sparrow-hawk. But you have no lady so you will
not be able to fight."

Then Geraint leaned forward toward the earl.

"With your leave, noble Earl Yniol," he replied, "I will do battle for
your daughter. For although I have seen all the beauties of the day
never have I come upon anything so wonderfully lovely as she. If it
should happen that I prove victor, as true as heaven, I will make her my
wife!"

Yniol's heart danced in his bosom for joy, and he turned about for Enid,
but she had fluttered away as soon as her name had been mentioned, so
he tenderly grasped the hands of her mother in his own and said:

"Mother, young girls are shy little things and best understood by their
own mothers. Before you go to rest to night, find out what Enid will
think about this."

So the earl's wife passed out to speak with Enid, and Enid became so
glad and excited that she could not sleep the entire happy night long.
But very early the next morning, as soon as the pale sky began to redden
with the sun she arose, then called her mother, and hand in hand,
tripped over with her to the place of the tournament. There they awaited
for Yniol and Geraint. Geraint came wearing the Earl's rusty, worn old
arms, yet in spite of them looked stately and princely.

Many other knights in blazing armor gathered there for the jousts, with
many fine ladies, and by and by the whole town full of people flooded
in, settling in a circle around the lists. Then the two forks were fixed
into the earth, above them a wand of silver was laid, and over it the
golden sparrow-hawk. The trumpet was blown and Yniol's nephew rose and
spoke:

"Come forward, my lady," he cried to the maiden who had come with him.
"Fairest of the fair, take the prize of beauty which I have won for you
during the past two years."

"Stay!" Prince Geraint cried loudly. "There is a worthier beauty here."

The earl's nephew looked round with surprise and disdain to see his
uncle's family and the prince.

"Do battle for it then," he shouted angrily.

Geraint sprang forward and the tourney was begun. Three times the two
warriors clashed together. _Three times they broke their spears._ Then
both were thrown from their horses. They now drew their swords; and
with them lashed at one another so frequently and with such dreadfully
hard strokes that all the crowd wondered. Now and again from the distant
walls came the sounds of applause, like the clapping of phantom hands.
The perspiration and the blood flowed together down the strong bodies of
the combatants. Each was as sturdy as the other.

[Illustration]

"Remember the great insult done our queen!" Earl Yniol cried at last.

This so inflamed Geraint that he heaved his vast sword-blade aloft,
cracked through his enemy's helmet, bit into the bone of his head,
felled the haughty knight, and set his feet upon his breast.

"Your name!" demanded Geraint.

"Edryn, the son of Nudd," groaned the fallen warrior.

"Very well, then Edryn, the son of Nudd," returned Geraint, "you must do
these two things or else you will have to die. First, you with your lady
and your dwarf must ride to Arthur's court at Caerleon and crave their
pardon for the insult you did the queen yesterday morning, and you must
bide her decree in the punishment she awards you. Secondly, you must
give back the earldom to your uncle the Earl of Yniol. You will do these
two things or you die."

"I will do them," cried Edryn. "For never before was I ever overcome.
But now all of my pride is broken down, for Enid has seen me fall."

With that Edryn rose from the ground like a man, took his lady and the
dwarf on their horses to Arthur's court. There receiving the sweet
forgiveness of the queen, he became a true knight of the Round Table,
and at the last died in battle while he fought for his king.

But Geraint when the tourney was over and he had come back to the
castle, drew Enid aside to tell her that early the next morning he would
have to start for Caerleon and that she should be ready to ride away
with him to be married at the court with tremendous pomp. For that would
be three days after the King's chase, when the prince had promised Queen
Guinevere he would be back. But of that he did not speak to Enid, who
wondered why he was so bent on returning immediately, and why she could
not have time at home to prepare herself some pretty robes to wear.

Imagine, she thought, such a grand and frightful thing as a court, the
queen's court, with all the graceful ladies staring at her in that faded
old silk dress! And although she promised Geraint that she would go as
he wished, when she woke to the dread day for making her appearance at
court, she still yearned that he would only stay yet a little while so
that she could sew herself some clothes, that she had the flowered silk
which her mother had given her three years ago for her birthday and
which Edryn's men had robbed from her when they sacked the house and
scattered everything she ever owned to all the winds. How she wished
that handsome Geraint had known her then, those three years ago when she
wore so many pretty dresses and jewels!

But while she lay dreamily thinking, softly in trod her mother bearing
on her arm a gorgeous, delicate robe.

"Do you recognize it, child?" she cried.

It was that self-same birthday dress, three years old, but as beautiful
as new and never worn.

"Yesterday after the jousts your father went through all the town from
house to house and ordered that all sack and plunder which the men had
taken from us should be brought back, for he was again to be in his
earldom. So last evening while you were talking with the prince some one
came up from the town and placed this in my hands. I did not tell you
about it then for I wished to keep it as a sweet surprise for you this
morning. And it is a sweet surprise, isn't it? For although the prince
yesterday did say that you were the fairest of the fair there is no
handsome girl in the world but looks handsomer in new clothes than in
old. And it would have been a shame for you to go to the court in your
poor old faded silk which you have worn so long and so patiently. The
great ladies there might say that Prince Geraint had plucked up some
ragged robin from the hedges."

[Illustration: BEARING A GORGEOUS ROBE.]

So Enid was put into the fine flowered robe.

Her mother said that after she had gone to the queen's court, she, the
poor old mother at home, who was too feeble to journey so far with her
daughter, would think over and over again of her pretty princess at
Camelot. And the old gray Earl Yniol went in to tell Geraint of Enid's
fanciful apparel.

But Geraint was not delighted with the magnificence.

"Say to her," he answered the earl, "that by all my love for her,
although I give her no other reason, I entreat Enid to wear that faded
old silk dress of hers and no other."

This amazing and hard message from Geraint made poor little Enid's face
fall like a meadowful of corn blasted by a rainstorm. Still she
willingly laid aside her gold finery for his sake, slipped into the
faded silk, and pattered down the steps to meet Geraint. He scanned her
so eagerly from her tip to her toe that both her rosy cheeks burned like
flames. Then as he noted her mother's clouded face he said very kindly:

"My new mother don't be very angry, or grieved with your new son because
of what I have just asked Enid to do. I had a very good reason for it
and I will explain it all to you. The other day when I left the queen at
Caerleon to avenge the insult done her by Edryn, the son of Nudd, she
made me two wishes. The one was that I should be successful with my
quest and the other was that I should wed with my first love. Then she
promised that whoever my bride should be she herself with her own royal
hands would dress her for her wedding day, splendidly, like the very sun
in the skies. So when I found this lovely Enid of yours in her shabby
clothes I vowed that the queen's hands only should array her in handsome
new robes that befitted her grace and beauty. But never mind, dear
mother, some day you will come to see Enid and then she will wear the
golden, flowered birthday dress which you gave her three years ago."

Then the earl's wife smiled through her tears, wrapped Enid in a mantle,
kissed her gentle farewells, and in a moment saw her riding far, far
away beside Geraint.

The queen Guinevere that day had three times climbed the royal tower at
Caerleon to look far into the valley for some sign of Geraint, who had
promised to be back that day, if he did not fall in battle, and who
would certainly come now, since Edryn had been vanquished and had come
to the court. At last when evening had fallen she spied the prince's
charger pacing nobly along the road, and Enid's palfrey at his side.
Instantly Queen Guinevere sped down from the small window in the high
turret, tripped out to the gate to greet him and embrace the lovely Enid
as a long-loved friend.

The old City of Caerleon was gay for one whole week, over the wedding
week of Geraint and Enid. The queen herself dressed Enid for her
marriage like the very sunlight, Dubric, the highest saint of the
church, married them, and they lived for nearly a year at the court with
Arthur and sweet Guinevere.

And so the insult done the queen was avenged, and her two wishes were
fulfilled. For Geraint overcame his enemy and wedded with his
first-love, dressed for her marriage by the queen.




GERAINT'S QUEST OF HONOR.


One morning Prince Geraint went into Arthur's hall and said:

"O King, my princedom is in danger. It lies close to the territory which
is infested with bandits, earls and caitiff knights, assassins and all
sorts of outlaws. Give me your kind good leave and I will go there to
defend my lands."

The king said the prince might go, and sent fifty armed knights to
protect him and pretty Enid as they traveled away on their horses across
the Severn River into their own country, the Land of Devon.

After Geraint had come into Devon he forgot what he had said to the king
of ridding his princedom of outlawry, he forgot the chase where he had
always been so clever in tracking his game, forgot the tournament where
he had won victory after victory, forgot all his former glory and his
name, forgot his lands and their cares, forgot everything he ever did,
and did nothing at all but lie about at home and talk with Enid. At last
all his people began to gossip about their fine prince who once had been
illustrious everywhere and now had become an idle stay-at-home who spent
his time in making love to his wife.

[Illustration: ENID HEARD OF GERAINT FROM HER HAIR-DRESSER.]

Enid heard of the tattling about Geraint from her hair-dresser, and one
morning as he lay abed, she went over it all to herself, talking aloud.
She wished, that he would not abandon all his knightly pursuits but
would hunt and fight again and add to his lustre. She felt very bashful
about mentioning the matter to him as she was very shy by nature and
lived in a time when wives were altogether over-ruled by their husbands,
yet to say nothing she thought would not be showing herself a true wife
to Geraint. All this and more Enid went over to herself.

The drowsy prince, half awake, just half heard her and quite
misunderstood her meaning. When she said that in keeping quiet about the
gossip she was not a true wife to him he supposed she meant that she no
longer cared for him, that he was not a handsome and strong enough man
to suit her. This grieved him deeply and made him very angry with her,
for Geraint had really given up all the glory of the king's court just
to be alone with Enid, although no one knew it. And the thought that now
she looked down upon him infuriated all his heart. A word would have
made everything right but he didn't say it.

Springing up quickly from his bed he roused his squire and said, "Get
ready our horses, my charger and the princess' palfrey. And you,"
turning a frowning face to the princess, "put on the worst looking,
meanest, poorest dress you have and come away with me. We are going on a
quest of honor and then you will see what sort of soldier I am."

Enid wondered why her lord was so vexed with her and replied, "If I have
displeased you surely you will tell me why."

But Geraint would not say; he could not bear to speak of it. So Enid
hurried after her poor old faded silk gown with the summer flowers among
its folds, which she had worn to ride from her old home to Caerleon, and
hastily dressed.

"Do not ride at my side," Geraint said as they both mounted their horses
to start away. "Ride ahead of me, a good way ahead of me, and no matter
what may happen, do not speak a word to me, no not a word."

Enid listened, wondering what had come over her lord.

"There!" he cried as they were off, "we will make our way along with our
iron weapons, not with gold money." So saying, he loosed the great purse
which dangled from his belt and tossed it back to his squire who stood
on the marble threshold of the doorway where the golden coins flashed
and clattered as they scattered every which-way over the floor. "Now
then, Enid, to the wild woods!"

At that they made for the swampy, desolated forest lands that were
famous for their perilous paths and their bandits, Enid with a white
face going before, Geraint coming gloomily nearly a quarter of a mile
after.

The morning was only half begun when the white princess became aware
that behind a rock hiding in the shadow stood three tall knights on
horseback, armed from tip to toe, bandit outlaws lying in wait to fall
upon whoever should pass. She heard one saying to his comrades as he
pointed toward Geraint:

"Look here comes some lazy-bones who seems just about as bold as a dog
who has had the worst of it in a fight. Come, we will kill him, and then
we will take his horse and armor and his lady."

Enid thought, "I'll go back a little way to Geraint and tell him about
these ruffians, for even if it will madden him I should rather have him
kill me than to have him fall into their hands."

She guided her palfrey backward and bravely met the frowning face which
greeted her, saying timidly:

"My lord, there are three bandit knights behind a rock a little way
beyond us who are boasting that they will slay you and steal your horse
and armor and make me their captive."

"Did I tell you," cried Geraint angrily, "that you should warn me of any
danger. There was only one thing which I told you to do and that was to
keep quiet; and this is the way you have heeded me! a pretty way! But
win or lose, you shall see by these fellows that my vigor is not lost."

Then Enid stood back as the three outlaws flashed out of their ambush
and bore down upon the prince.

Geraint aimed first for the middle one, driving his long spear into the
bandit's breast and out on the other side. The two others in the
meanwhile had dashed upon him with their lances, but they had broken on
his magnificent armor like so many icicles. He now turned upon them with
his broadsword, swinging it first to the right and then to the left,
first stunning them with his blows, then slaying them outright. And when
all three had fallen he dismounted, and like a hunter skinning the wild
beasts he has shot, he stripped the three robber knights of their gay
suits of armor, and leaving the bodies lie, bound each man's sword,
spear and coat of arms to his horse, tied the three bridle reins of the
three empty horses together and cried to Enid.

"Drive these on before you."

Enid drove them on across the wastelands, Geraint following after. As
she passed into the first shallow shade of the forest she described
three more horsemen partly hidden in the gloom of three sturdy
oak-trees. All were armed and one was a veritable giant, so tall and
bulky, towering above his companions.

[Illustration: THE THREE OUTLAWS BORE DOWN UPON THE PRINCE.]

"See there, a prize!" bellowed the giant and set Enid's pulses in a
quiver. "Three horses and three suits of armor, and all in charge
of--whom? A girl! Isn't that simple? Lay on, my men!"

"No," cried the second, "behind is coming a knight. A coward and a fool,
for see how he hangs his head."

The giant thundered back gaily.

"Yes? Only one? Wait here and as he goes by make for him."

"I will go no farther until Geraint comes," Enid said to herself
stopping her horse. "And then I will tell him about these villains. He
must be so weary with his other fight and they will fall upon him
unawares. I shall have to disobey him again for his own sake. How could
I dare to obey him and let him be harmed? I must speak; if he kills me
for it I shall only have lost my own life to save a life that is dearer
to me than my own."

So she waited until the prince approached when she said with a timid
firmness, "Have I your leave to speak?"

"You take it without asking when you speak," he replied, and she
continued:

"There are three men lurking in the woods behind some oaks and one of
them is larger than you, a perfect giant. He told them to attack you as
you passed by them."

"If there were a hundred men in the wood and each of them a giant and if
they all made for me together I vow it would not anger me so as to have
you disobey me. Stand aside while we do battle and when we are done
stand by the victor."

At this, while Enid fell back breathing short fits of prayer but not
daring to watch, Geraint proceeded to meet his assailants. The giant was
the first to dash out for him aiming his lance at Geraint's helmet, but
the lance missed and went to one side. Geraint's spear had been a
little strained with his first encounter, but it struck through the
bulky giant's corselet and pierced his breast, then broke, one-half of
it still fast in the flesh as the giant knight fell to the earth. The
other two bandits now felt that their support and hero was gone, and
when Geraint darted rapidly on them, uttering his terrible warcry as if
there were a thousand men behind him to come to his aid, they flew into
the woods. But they were soon overtaken and pitilessly put to death.
Then Geraint, selecting the best lance, the brightest and strongest
among their spears to replace the one he had broken on the giant, he
plucked off the gaudy armor from each brigand's body, laid it on the
backs of the three horses, tied the bridle reins together and handed
them to Enid with the words, "Drive them on before you."

So Enid now followed the wild paths of the gloomy forest with two sets
of three horses, each horse laden with his master's jingling weapons and
coat of mail. Geraint came after. As they passed out of the wood into
the open sky they came to a little town with towers upon a rocky hill,
and beneath it a wide meadowland with mowers in it, mowing the hay. Down
a stony pathway from the town skipped a fair-haired lad carrying a
basket of lunch for the laborers in the field.

"Friend!" cried Geraint, as the lad trotted past him, for he saw that
Enid looked very white, "let my lady have something to eat. She is so
faint."

"Willingly," the youth answered, "and you too, my lord, even although
this feed is very coarse and only fit for the mowers."

He set down his basket and Enid and Geraint alighted and put all the
horses to graze, while they sat down on the green sward to have some
bread and barley. Enid felt too faint at heart, thinking of the
prince's strange conduct, to care a great deal for food, but Geraint was
hungry enough and had all the mowers' basket emptied almost before he
knew it.

"Boy," he cried half-ashamed, "everything is gone, which is a disgrace.
But take one of my horses and his arms by way of payment, choose the
very best."

The poor lad, who might as well have had a kingdom given him, reddened
with his extreme surprise and delight.

"My lord, you are over-paying me fifty times," he cried.

"You will be all the wealthier then," returned the prince, gaily.

"I'll take it as free gift, then," the lad answered. "The food is not
worth much. While your lady is resting here I can easily go back and
fetch more, some more for the earl's mowers. For all these mowers belong
to our great earl, and all these fields are his, and I am his, too. I'll
tell him what a fine man you are, and he will have you to his palace and
serve you with costly dinners."

"I wish no better fare than I have had," Geraint said, "I never ate
better in my life than just now when I left your poor mowers dinnerless.
And I will go into no earl's palace. If he desires to see me, let him
come to me. Now you go hire us some pleasant room in the town, stall our
horses and when you return with the food for these men tell us about
it."

"Yes, my kind lord," the glad youth cried, and he held his head high and
thought he was a gorgeous knight off to the wars as he disappeared up
the rocky path leading his handsome horse.

The prince turned himself sleepily to watch the lusty mowers laboring
under the sun as it blazed on their scythes, while Enid plucked the long
grass by the meadows' edge to weave it round and round her wedding
ring, until the boy returned and showed them the room he had got in the
town.

"If you wish anything, call the woman of the house," Prince Geraint said
to Enid as the door closed behind them. "Do not speak to me."

"Yes, my lord," returned Enid, still marvelling at his cold ways.

Silently they sat down, she at one end, he at the other, as quiet as
pictures. But suddenly a mass of voices sounded up the street, and heel
after heel echoing upon the pavement. In a twinkling the door to their
room was pushed back to the wall while a mob of boisterous young
gentlemen tumbled in led by the Earl of Limours, the wild lord of the
town, and Enid's old suitor whom her father had rejected long ago, a man
as beautiful as a woman and very graceful. He seized the prince's hand
warmly, welcomed him to the town and stealthily, out of the corner of
his eye, caught a glimpse of unhappy Enid nestled all alone at the
farther end of the room.

The prince immediately sent for every sort of delicious things to eat
and drink from the town, told the earl, to bid all his friends for a
feast and soon was gaily making merry with the men, drinking, laughing,
joking.

"May I have your leave, my lord," cried Earl Limours, "to cross the room
and speak a word with your lady who seems so lonely?"

"My free leave," cried the merry Prince Geraint, who did not know the
earl, "Get her to speak with you; she has nothing to say to me."

As Limours stepped to Enid's side he lifted his eyes adoringly, bowed at
her side and said in a whisper:

"Enid, you pilot star of my life, I see that Geraint is very unkind to
you and loves you no longer. What a laughing stock he is making of you
with that wretched old dress you have on! But I, I love you still as
always. Just say the word and I will have him put into the keep and you
will come with me. I will be kind to you forever."

The tears fluttered into the earl's eyes as he spoke.

"Earl," replied Enid, "if you love me as you used to do in the years
long ago, and are not joking now, come in the morning and take me by
force from the prince. But leave me tonight. I am wearied to death."

So the earl made a low bow, brandishing his plumes until they brushed
his very insteps, while the stout prince bade him a loud good night, and
he moved away talking to his men.

[Illustration: THE EARL MADE A LOW BOW.]

But as soon as he was gone Enid began to plan how she could escape with
Geraint before Earl Limours should come after her in the morning. She
was too afraid of Geraint to speak with him about it, but when he had
fallen asleep she stepped lightly about the room and gathered the pieces
of his armor together in one place ready for an early departure on the
morrow. Then she dropped off into slumber. But suddenly she heard a loud
sound, the earl with his wild following blowing his trumpet to call her
to come out, she thought. But it was only the great red cock in the
yard below crowing at the daylight which had begun to glimmer now across
the heap of Geraint's armor. She rose immediately in her fright to see
that all was well, went over to examine the weapons and unwittingly let
the casque fall jangling to the floor. This woke Geraint, who started up
and stared at her.

"My lord," began Enid, and then she told him all that Earl Limours had
said to her and how she had put him off by telling him to come this
morning.

"Call the woman of the house and tell her to bring the charger and the
palfrey," Geraint cried angrily. "Your sweet face makes fools of good
fellows." Geraint loved Enid still and he was in as great perplexity as
she, for after misunderstanding what she had said he no more knew
whether she cared for him truly than she knew what was troubling him and
making him act in this unaccountable manner.

Enid slipped through the sleeping household like a ghost to deliver the
prince's message to the landlord, hurried back to help Geraint with his
armor and came down with him to spring upon her palfrey.

"What do I owe you, friends?" the prince asked his host, but before the
man could reply he added "take those five horses and their burdens of
arms."

"My lord, I have scarcely spent the price of one of them on you!" cried
the landlord astonished.

"You'll have all the more riches then," the prince laughed, then turning
to Enid, "today I charge you more particularly than ever before that
whatever you may see, hear, fancy or imagine, do not speak to me, but
obey."

"Yes, my lord," answered Enid, "I know your wish and should like to
obey, but when I go riding ahead, I hear all the violent threats you do
not hear and see the danger you cannot see, and then not to give you
warning seems hard, almost beyond me. Yet, I wish to obey you."

"Do so, then," said he. "Do not be too wise, seeing that you are
married, not to a clown but a strong man with arms to guard his own head
and yours, too."

The broad beaten path which they now took passed through toward the
wasted lands bordering on the castle of Earl Doorm, the Bull, as his
people called him, because of his ferocity.

It was still early morning when Enid caught the sound of quantities of
hoofs galloping up the road. Turning round she saw cloudsful of dust and
the points of lances sparkling in it. Then, not to disobey the prince,
yet to give him warning, she held up her finger and pointed toward the
dust. Geraint was pleased at her cunning, and immediately stopped his
horse. The moment after, the Earl of Limours dashed in upon him on a
charger as black and as stormy as a thunder-cloud.

Geraint closed with the earl, bore down on him with his spear, and in a
minute brought him stunned or dead to the ground. Then he turned to the
next-comer after Limours, overthrew him and blindly rushed back upon all
the men behind. But they were so startled at the flash and movement of
the prince that they scrambled away in a panic, leaving their leader
lying on the public highway. The horses also of the fallen warriors
whisked off from their wounded masters and wildly flew away to mix with
the vanishing mob.

"Horse and man, all of one mind," remarked Geraint, smiling, "not a hoof
of them left. What do you say, Enid, shall we strip the earl and pay for
a dinner or shall we fast? Fast? Then go on and let us pray heaven to
send us some Earl of Doorm's men so that we can earn ourselves something
to eat."

Enid sadly eyed her bridle-reins and led the way, Geraint coming after,
scarcely knowing that he had been pricked by Limours in his side, and
that he was bleeding secretly beneath his armor. But at last his head
and helmet began to wag unsteadily, and at a sudden swerving of the road
he was tossed from his horse upon a bank of grass. Enid heard the
clashing of the fall, and too terrified to cry out, came back all pale.
Then she dismounted, loosed the fastenings of his armor and bound up his
wounds with her veil. Then she sat down desolately and began to cry,
wondering what ever she should do.

[Illustration: ENID SAT DOWN DESOLATELY AND BEGAN TO CRY.]

Many men passed by but no one took any notice of her. For in that
lawless, turbulent earldom no one minded a woman weeping for a murdered
lover than they now mind a summer shower. One man scurrying as fast as
ever he could travel toward the bandit earl's castle, drove the sand
sweeping into her poor eyes, and another coming in the opposite
direction from out the earl's castle park in seeming hot haste, turned
all the long dusty road into a column of smoke behind him, and
frightened her little palfrey so that it scoured off into the coppices
and was lost. But the prince's charger stood beside them and grieved
over the mishap like a man.

At noon a huge warrior with a big face and russet beard and eyes rolling
about in search of prey, came riding hard by with a hundred spearmen at
his back all bound for some foray. It was the frightful Earl Doorm.

"What, is he dead?" cried the earl loudly to Enid, as he spied her on
the wayside.

"No, no, not dead," she quickly answered. "Would some of your kind
people take him up and bear him off somewhere out of this cruel sun? I
am very sure, quite sure that he is not dead."

"Well, if he isn't dead, why should you cry for him so? Dead or not
dead, you just spoil your pretty face with idiotic tears. They will not
help him. But since it is a pretty face, come fellows, some of you, and
take him to our hall. If he lives he will be one of our band, and if
not, why there is earth enough to bury him in. See that you take his
charger, too, a noble one."

And so saying, the rude earl passed on, while two brawny horsemen came
forward growling to think they might lose their chance of booty from the
morning's raid all for this dead man. They raised the prince upon a
litter, laying him in the hollow of his shield, and brought him into
the barren hall of Doorm, while Enid and the gentle charger followed
after. They tossed him and his litter down on an oaken settle in the
hall, and then shot away for the woods.

Enid sat through long hours all alone with Geraint besides the oaken
settle, propping his head and chafing his hands, but in the late
afternoon she saw the huge Earl Doorm returning with his lusty spearmen
and their plunder. Each hurled down a heap of spoils on the floor, threw
aside his lance and doffed his helmet, while a tribe of brightly gowned
gentle-women fluttered into the hall and began to talk with them. Earl
Doorm struck his knife against the table and bellowed for meat, and
wine. In a moment the place fairly steamed and smoked with whole roast
hogs and oxen, and everybody sat down in a hodge-podge and ate like
cattle feeding in their stalls, while Enid shrank far back startled,
into her nook.

But suddenly, when Earl Doorm had eaten all he would, and all he could
for the moment, he revolved his eyes about the bare hall and caught a
glimpse of the fair little lady drooping in her niche. Then he
recollected how she had crouched weeping by the roadside for her fallen
lord that morning. A wild pity filled his gruff heart.

"Eat, eat!" he shouted. "I never before saw any thing so pale. Be
yourself. Isn't your lord lucky, for were I dead who is there in all the
world who would mourn for me? Sweet lady, never have I ever seen a lily
like you. If there were a bit of color living in your cheeks there is
not one among my gentle-women here who would be fit to wear your
slippers for gloves. But listen to me and you will share my earldom with
me, girl, and we will live like two birds in a nest and I will bring you
all sorts of finery from every part of the world to make you happy."

As the earl spoke his two cheeks bulged with the two tremendous morsels
of meat which he had tucked into his mouth.

Enid was more alarmed than ever.

"How can I be happy over anything," replied she, "until my lord is well
again?"

The earl laughed, then plucked her up out of the corner, carried her
over to the table, thrust a dish of food before her and held a horn of
wine to her lips.

"By all heaven," cried Enid, "I will not drink until my lord gets up and
drinks and eats with me. And if he will not rise again I will not drink
any wine until I die."

At this the earl turned perfectly red and paced up and down the hall,
gnawing first his upper and then his lower lip.

"Girl," shouted he, "why wail over a man who shames your beauty so, by
dressing it in that rag? Put off those beggar-woman's weeds and robe
yourself in this which my gentle-woman has brought you."

It was a gorgeous, wonderful dress, colored in the tints of a shallow
sea with the blue playing into the green, and gemmed with precious
stones all down the front of it as thick as dewdrops on the grass. But
Enid was harder to move than any cold tyrant on his throne, and said:

"Earl, in this poor gown my dear lord found me first and loved me while
I was living with my father; in this poor gown I rode with him to court
and was presented to the queen; in this poor gown he bade me ride as we
came out on this fatal quest of honor, and in this poor gown I am going
to stay until he gets up again, a live, strong man, and tells me to put
it away. I have griefs enough, pray be gentle with me, let me be. O God!
I beg of your gentleness, since he is as he is, to let me be."

Then the brutal earl strode up and down the hall and cried out:

"It is of no more use to be gentle with you than to be rough. So take my
salute," and with that he slapped her lightly on her white cheek.

Enid shrieked. Instantly the fallen Geraint was up on his feet with the
sword that had laid beside him in the hollow of the shield, making a
single bound for the earl, and with one sweep of it sheared through the
swarthy neck. The rolling eyes turned glassy, the russet-bearded head
tumbled over the floor like a ball, and all the bandit knights and the
gentle-women in the hall flitted, scampering pell-mell away, yelling as
if they had seen a ghoul. Enid and Geraint were left alone.

[Illustration: THE RUSSET-BEARDED HEAD TUMBLED OVER THE FLOOR LIKE A
BALL.]

Now Geraint had come out of his swoon before the earl had returned, and
he had lain perfectly silent and immovable because he wished to test
Enid and see what she would do when she thought he was sleeping or
fainted away, or perhaps dead. So he had listened to all that had taken
place and had heard everything that Earl Doorm had said to her and all
that Enid had replied, so now he knew that she loved him as ever and
that she stood steadfast by him. All his heart filled with pity and
remorse that he had brought her away on this hard, hard quest, and had
made her suffer so much and had been so rough and cold.

"Enid," said the prince tenderly, very tenderly. "I have used you worse
than that big dead brute of a man used you. I have done you more wrong
than he. I misunderstood you. Now, now you are three times mine."

Geraint's kindness burst upon Enid so abruptly and was so unforeseen
that she could not speak a word only this:

"Fly, Geraint, they will kill you, they will come back. Fly. Your horse
is outside, my poor little thing is lost."

"You shall ride behind me, then, Enid."

So they slipped quickly outside, found the stately charger and mounted
him, first Geraint, then Enid, climbing up the prince's feet, and
throwing her arms about him to hold herself firm as they bounded off.

But as the horse dashed outside of the earl's gateway there before them
in the highroad stood a knight of Arthur's court holding his lance as if
ready to spring upon Geraint.

"Stranger!" shrieked Enid, thinking of the prince's wound and loss of
blood, "do not kill a dead man!"

"The voice of Enid!" cried the stranger knight.

Then Enid saw that he was Edryn, the son of Nudd, and feeling the more
terrified as she remembered the jousts, cried out:

"O, cousin, this is the man who spared your life!"

[Illustration: BEFORE THEM IN THE HIGHROAD STOOD A KNIGHT OF ARTHUR'S
COURT.]

Edryn stepped forward. "My lord Geraint," he said, "I took you for some
bandit knight of Doorm's. Do not fear, Enid, that I will attack the
prince. I love him. When he overthrew me at the lists he threw me
higher. For now I have been made a Knight of the Round Table and am
altogether changed. But since I used to know Earl Doorm in the old days
when I was lawless and half a bandit myself, I have come as the
mouthpiece of our king to tell Doorm to disband all his men and become
subject to Arthur, who is now on his way hither."

"Doorm is now before the King of Kings," Geraint replied, "And his men
are already scattered," and the prince pointed to groups in the
thickets or still running off in their panic. Then back to the people
all aghast whom they could see huddling, he related fully to Edryn how
he had slain the huge earl in his own hall.

[Illustration: TO THE ROYAL CAMP WHERE ARTHUR CAME OUT TO GREET THEM.]

"Come with me to the king," astonished Edryn said.

So they all traveled off to the royal camp where Arthur himself came out
to greet them, lifted Enid from her saddle, kissed her and showed her a
tent where his own physician came in to attend to Geraint's wound. When
that was healed he rode away with them to Caerleon for a visit with
Queen Guinevere, who dressed Enid again in magnificent clothes. Then
fifty armed knights escorted Enid and the prince as far as the banks of
the Severn River, where they crossed over into the land of Devon. And
all their people welcomed them back.

Geraint after that never forgot his princedom or the tournament, but was
known through all the country round as the cleverest and bravest
warrior, while his princess was called Enid the Good.




MERLIN AND VIVIEN.


Vivien was a very clever, wily and wicked woman, who wanted to become a
greater magician than even the great Merlin, who was the most famous man
of all his times, who understood all the arts, who had built the king's
harbors, ships and halls, who was a fine poet and who could read the
future in the stars in the skies.

He had once told Vivien of a charm that he could work to make people
invisible. Whenever he worked it upon anyone that person would seem to
be imprisoned within the four walls of a tower and could not get out.
The person would seem dead, lost to every one, and could be seen only by
the person who worked the charm. Vivien yearned to know what the charm
was, for she wanted to cast its spell on Merlin so that no one would
know where he was and she could become a great enchantress in the realm,
as she foolishly thought. And she planned very cleverly so as to find
out the wise old man's secret.

She wanted him to think that she loved him dearly. At first she played
about him with lively, pretty talk, vivid smiles, and he watched and
laughed at her as if she were a playful kitten. Then as she saw that he
half disdained her she began to put on very grave and serious fits,
turned red and pale when he came near her, or sighed or gazed at him, so
silently and with such sweet devotion that he half believed that she
really loved him truly.

[Illustration: HE LAUGHED AT HER.]

But after a while a great melancholy fell over Merlin, he felt so
terribly sad that he passed away out of the kings' court and went down
to the beach. There he found a little boat and stepped into it. Vivien
had followed him without his knowing it. She sat down in the boat and
while he took the sail she seized the helm of the boat. They were driven
across the sea with a strong wind and came to the shores of Brittany.
Here Merlin got out and Vivien followed him all the way into the wild
woods of Broceliande. Every step of the way Merlin was perfectly quiet.

They sat down together, she lay beside him and kissed his feet as if in
the deepest reverence and love. A twist of gold was wound round her
hair, a priceless robe of satiny samite clung about her beautiful limbs.
As she kissed his feet she cried:

"Trample me down, dear feet which I have followed all through the world
and I will worship you. Tread me down and I will kiss you for it."

But Merlin still said not a word.

[Illustration: MERLIN FELT SO TERRIBLY SAD.]

"Merlin do you love me?" at last cried Vivien, with her face sadly
appealing to him. And again, "O, Merlin, do you love me?" "Great Master,
do you love me?" she cried for the third time.

And then when he was as quiet as ever she writhed up toward him, slid
upon his knee, twined her feet about his ankles, curved her arms about
his neck and used one of her hands as a white comb to run through his
long ashy beard which she drew all across her neck down to her knees.

"See! I'm clothing myself with wisdom," she cried. "I'm a golden summer
butterfly that's been caught in a great old tyrant spider's web that's
going to eat me up in this big wild wood without a word to me."

"What do you mean, Vivien, with these pretty tricks of yours?" cried
Merlin at last. "What do you want me to give you?"

"What!" said Vivien, smiling saucily, "have you found your tongue at
last? Now yesterday you didn't open your lips once except to drink. And
then I, with my own lady hands, made a pretty cup and offered you your
water kneeling before you and you drank it, but gave me not a word of
thanks. And when we stopped at the other spring when you lay with your
feet all golden with blossoms from the meadows we passed through you
know that I bathed your feet before I bathed my own. But yet no thanks
from you. And all through this wild wood, all through this morning when
I fondled you, still not a word of thanks."

Then Merlin locked her hand in his and said, "Vivien, have you never
seen a wave as it was coming up the beach ready to break? Well, I've
been seeing a wave that was ready to break on me. It seemed to me that
some dark, tremendous wave was going to come and sweep me away from my
hold on the world, away from my fame and my usefulness and my great
name. That's why I came away from Arthur's court to make me forget it
and feel better. And when I saw you coming after me it seemed to me that
you were that wave that was going to roll all over me. But pardon me,
now, child, your pretty ways have brightened everything again, and now
tell me what you would like to have from me. For I owe you something
three times over, once for neglecting you, twice for the thanks for your
goodness to me, and lastly for those dainty gambols of yours. So tell me
now, what will you have?"

Vivien smiled mournfully as she answered:

"I've always been afraid that you were not really mine, that you didn't
love me truly, that you didn't quite trust me, and now you yourself have
owned it. Don't you see, dear love, how this strange mood of yours must
make me feel it more than ever? must make me yearn still more to prove
that you are mine, must make me wish still more to know that great charm
of waving hands and woven footsteps that you told me about, just as a
proof that you trust me? If you told that to me I should know that you
are mine, and I should have the great proof of your love, because I
think that however wise you may be you do not know me yet."

"I never was less wise, you inquisitive Vivien," said Merlin, "than when
I told you about that charm. Why won't you ask me for another boon?"

Then Vivien, as if she were the tenderest hearted little maid that ever
lived, burst into tears and said:

"No, master, don't be angry at your little girl. Caress me, let me feel
myself forgiven, for I have not the heart to ask for another boon. I
don't suppose that you know the old rhyme, 'Trust not at all or all in
all?'"

Then Merlin looked at her and half believed what she said. Her voice was
so tender, her face was so fair, her eyes were so sweetly gleaming
behind her tears.

He locked her hand in his again and said, "If you should know this charm
you might sometimes in a wild moment of anger or a mood of overstrained
affection when you wanted me all to yourself or when you were jealous
in a sudden fit, you might work it on me."

"Good!" cried Vivien, as if she were angry, "I am not trusted. Well,
hide it away, hide it, and I shall find it out, and when I've found it
beware, look out for Vivien! When you use me so it's a wonder that I can
love you at all, and as for jealousy, it seems to me this wonderful
charm was invented just to make me jealous. I suppose you have a lot of
pretty girls whom you have caged here and there all over the world with
it."

Then the great master laughed merrily.

"Long, long years ago," he said, "there lived a King in the farthest
East of the East. A tawny pirate who had plundered twenty islands or
more anchored his boat in the King's port, and in the boat was a woman.
For, as he had passed one of the islands the pirates had seen two cities
full of men in boats fighting for a woman on the sea; he had pushed up
his black boat in among the rest, lightly scattered every one of them
and brought her off with half his people killed with arrows. She was a
maiden so smooth, so white, so wonderful that a light seemed to come
from her as she walked. When the pirate came upon the shore of the
Eastern King's island the King asked him for the woman, but he would not
give her up. So the King imprisoned the pirate and made the woman his
queen.

"All the people adored her, the King's councilmen and all his soldiers,
the beasts themselves. The camels knelt down before her unbidden, and
the black slaves of the mountains rang her golden ankle bells just to
see her smile. So little wonder that the King grew very jealous. He had
his horns blown through all the hundred under-kingdoms which he ruled,
telling the people that he wanted a wizard who would teach him some
charm to work upon the queen and make her all his own. To the wizard who
could do this he promised a league of mountain land full of golden
mines, a province with a hundred miles of coast, a palace and a
princess. But all the wizards who failed should be killed and their
heads would be hung on the city gates until they mouldered away.

"So there were many, many wizards all through the hundred kingdoms who
tried to work the charm, but failed; many wizard heads bleached on the
walls, and for weeks a troupe of carrion crows hung like a cloud above
the towers of the city gateways. But at last the king's men found a
little glassy headed, hairless man who lived alone in a great wilderness
and ate nothing but grass. He read only one book, and by always reading
had got grated down, filed away and lean, with monstrous eyes and his
skin clinging to his bones. But since he never tasted wine or flesh--the
wall that separates people from spirits became crystal to him. He could
see through it, perceive the spirits as they walked and hear them
talking; so he learned their secrets. Often he drew a cloud of rain
across a sunny sky, or when there was a wild storm and the pine woods
roared he made everything calm again.

"He was the man that was wanted. They dragged him to the king's court by
force, he didn't want to go. There he taught the king how to charm the
queen so that no one could see her again, and she could see no one
except the king as he passed about the palace. She lay as if quite dead
and lost to life. But when the king offered the magician his league of
golden mines, the province with a hundred miles of sea coast, the palace
and the princess, the old man turned away, went back to his wilderness
and lived on grass and vanished away. But his book came down to me."

"You have the book!" cried Vivian smiling saucily. "The charm is written
in it. Good, take my advice and let me know the secret at once, for if
you should hide it away like a puzzle in a chest, if you should put
chest upon chest, and lock and padlock each chest thirty times and bury
them all away under some vast mound like the heaps of soldiers on the
battle-field, still I should hit upon some way of digging it out, of
picking it, of opening it and reading the charm. And _then_ if I tried
it on you who would blame me?"

"You read the book, my pretty Vivien?" cried Merlin. "Well, it's only
twenty pages long, but such pages! Every page has a square of text that
looks like a blot, the letters no longer than fleas' legs written in a
language that has long gone by, and all the borders and margins
scribbled, crossed and crammed with notes. You read that book! No one,
not even I can read the text, and no one besides me can make out the
notes on the margins. I found the charm in the margin. Oh, it is simple
enough. Any child might work it and then not be able to undo it. Don't
ask me again for it, because even although you would love me too much to
try it on me, still you might try it on some of the knights of the Round
Table."

"O, you are crueller than any man ever told of in a story, or sung about
in song!" cried Vivien. She clapped her hands together and wailed out a
shriek. "I'm stabbed to the heart! I only wished that prove to you that
were wholly mine, that you loved me and now I'm killed with a word.
There's nothing left for me to do except crawl into some hole or cave,
and if the wolves won't tear me to pieces, just to weep my life away,
killed with unutterable unkindness!"

She paused, turned away, hung her head while the hair uncoiled itself.
Then she wept afresh.

The dark wood grew darker with a storm coming over the sky.

Merlin sat thinking quietly and half believed that she was true.

"Come out of the storm," he called over to her, "come here into the
hollow old oak tree."

Then since she didn't answer, he tried three times to calm her but quite
in vain. At last, however, she let herself be conquered, came back to
her old perch, and nestled there, half falling from his knees. Gentle
Merlin saw the slow tears still standing in her eyes and threw his arms
kindly about her. But Vivien unlinked herself at once, rose with her
arms crossed upon her bosom and fled away.

"No more love between us two," she cried, "for you do not trust me. Oh,
it would have been better if I had died three times over than to have
asked you once! Farewell, think gently of me and I will go. But before I
leave you let me swear once more that if I've been planning against you
in all this, may the dark heavens send one great flash from out the sky
to burn me to a cinder!"

Just as she ended a bolt of lightning darted across the sky, and sliced
the giant oak tree into a thousand splinters and spikes.

"Oh, Merlin, save me! save me!" cried Vivien, terrified lest the heavens
had heard her oath and were going to kill her. And she flew back to his
arms. She called him her dear protector, her lord and liege, her seer,
her bard, her silver star of evening, her God, her Merlin, the one
passionate love of her life, and hugged him close.

All the time overhead the tempest bellowed, the branches snapped above
them in the rushing rain. Her glittering eyes and neck seemed to come
and go before Merlin's eyes with the lightning. At last the storm had
spent its passion, the woodland was all in peace again, and Merlin,
overtalked and overworn had told all of the charm and had fallen asleep.

[Illustration: IN THE HOLLOW OF THE OLD OAK TREE LEFT HIM LYING DEAD.]

Then in a moment Vivien worked the charm with woven footsteps and waving
arms, and in the hollow of the old oak tree left him lying dead to all
life, use and fame and name.

"I have made his glory mine! O fool!" she shrieked, and she sprang down
through the great forest, the thicket closed about her behind her and
all the woods echoed, "Fool!"




BALIN AND BALAN.


King Pellam owed Arthur some tribute money so Arthur told three of his
knights to go see about it and collect it for him.

"Very well," said one of the knights, "but listen, on the way to King
Pellam's country, near Camelot, there are two strange knights sitting
beside a fountain. They challenge and overthrow every knight that
passes. Shall I stop to fight them as we go by and send them back to
you?"

Arthur laughed, "No, don't stop for anything; let them wait until they
can find some one stronger themselves."

With that the three men left. But after they had gone Arthur, who loved
a good fight himself, started away early one morning for the fountain
side of Camelot. On its right hand he saw the knight Balin sitting under
an alder tree, with his horse beside him, and on the left hand under a
poplar tree with his horse at his side sat the knight Balan.

"Fair sirs," cried Arthur, "why are you sitting here?"

"For the sake of glory," they answered. "We're stronger than all
Arthur's court. We've proved that because we easily overthrow every
knight that comes by here."

"Well, I'm of Arthur's court, too," replied the king, "although I've
never done so much in jousts as in real wars. But see whether you can
overthrow me so easily too."

So the two brothers came out boldly and fought with Arthur, but he
struck them both lightly down, then softly came away and nobody knew
anything about it.

But that evening while Balin and Balan sat very meekly by the bubbling
water a spangled messenger came riding by and cried out to them: "Sirs,
you are sent for by the King."

So they followed the man back to the court. "Tell me your names,"
demanded Arthur, "and why do you sit there by the fountain?"

[Illustration: TWO STRANGE KNIGHTS.]

"My name is Balin," answered one of the men, "and my brother's name is
Balan. Three years ago I struck down one of your slaves whom I heard had
spoken ill of me, and you sent me away for a three years' exile. Then I
thought that if we would sit by the well and would overcome every knight
who passed by you would be a more willing to take me back. But today
some man of yours came along and conquered us both. What do you wish
with me?"

"Be wiser for falling," Arthur said. "Your chair is in the hall vacant.
Take it again and be my knight once more."

So Balin went back into the old hall of the Knights of the Round Table,
and they all clashed their cups together drinking his welcome, and sang
until all of Arthur's banners of war hanging overhead began to stir as
they always did on the battlefield.

Meanwhile the men who had gone to collect the taxes from King Pellam
returned.

"Sir King," they cried to Arthur, "We scarcely could see Pellam for the
gloom in his hall. That man who used to be one of your roughest and most
riotous enemies is now living like a monk in his castle and has all
sorts of holy things about him, and says he has given up all matters of
the world. He wouldn't even talk about the tribute money and told us
that his heir Sir Garlon, attended to his business for him, so we went
to Garlon and after a struggle we got it. Then we came away, but as we
passed through the deep woods we found one of your knights lying dead,
killed by a spear. After we had buried him, we talked with an old
woodman who told us that there's a demon of the woods who had probably
slain the knight. This demon, he said, was once a man who lived all
alone and learned black magic. He hated people so much that when he died
he became a fiend. The woodman showed us the cave where he has seen the
demon go in and out and where he lives. We saw the print of a horse's
hoof, but no more."

"Foully and villainously slain!" cried Arthur thinking of his poor
killed knight in the woods. "Who will go hunt this demon of the woods
for me?"

"I!" exclaimed Balan, ready to dart instantly away, but first he
embraced Balin, saying, "Good brother, hear; don't let your angry
passions conquer you, fight them away. Remember how these knights of the
Round Table welcomed you back. Be a loving brother with them and don't
imagine that there is hatred among them here any more than there is in
heaven itself."

When bad Balan left, Balin set himself to learn how to curb his wildness
and become a courteous and manly knight. He always hovered about
Lancelot, the pattern knight of all the court, to see how he did, and
when he noticed Lancelot's sweet smiles and his little pleasant words
that gladdened every knight or churl or child that he passed, Balin
sighed like some lame boy who longed to scale a mountain top and could
scarcely limp up one hundred feet from the base.

"It's Lancelot's worship of the queen that helps to make him gentle,"
said he to himself. "If I want to be gentle I must serve and worship
lovely Queen Guinevere too. Suppose I ask the King to let me have some
token of hers on my shield instead of these pictures of wild beasts with
big teeth and grins. Then whenever I see it I'll forget my wild heats
and violences."

"What would you like to bear on your shield?" asked the king when Balin
spoke to him about his wish.

"The queen's own crown-royal," replied Balin.

Then the queen smiled and turned to Arthur. "The crown is only the
shadow of the king," she said, "and this crown is the shadow of that
shadow. But let him have it if it will help him out of his violences."

"It's no shadow to me, my queen," cried Balan, "no shadow to me, king.
It's a light for me."

So Balin was given the crown to bear on his shield and whenever he
looked at it, it seemed to make him feel gentle and patient.

But one morning as he heard Lancelot and the queen talking together on
the white walk of lilies that led to Queen Guinevere's bower, all his
old passions seemed to come back and filled him and he darted madly away
on his horse, not stopping until he had passed the fount where he had
sat with his brother Balan and had dived into the skyless woods beyond.
There the gray-headed woodman was hewing away wearily at a branch of a
tree.

[Illustration: BALIN WAS GIVEN THE CROWN TO WEAR ON HIS SHIELD.]

"Give me your axe, Churl," cried Balin, and with one sharp cut he struck
it down.

"Lord!" cried the woodman, "you could kill the devil of this woods if
any one can. Just yesterday I saw a flash of him. Some people say that
our Sir Garlon has learned black magic too and can ride armed unseen.
Just look into the demon's cave."

But Balin said the woodman was foolish, and rode off through the glades
with a drooping head. He did not notice that on his right a great cavern
chasm yawned out of the darkness. Once he heard the mosses beneath him
thud and tremble and then the shadow of a spear shot from behind him and
ran along the ground. The light of somebody's armor flashed by him and
vanished into the woods.

Balin dashed after this but he was so blinded by his rage that he
stumbled against a tree, breaking his lance and falling from his horse.
He sprang to his feet and darted off again not knowing where he was
going until the massy battlements of King Pellam's castle appeared.

"Why do you wear the crown royal on your shield?" Pellam's men asked him
as soon as they saw him.

"The fairest and best of ladies living gave it to me," Balin replied, as
he stalled his horse and strode across the court to the banquet hall.

"Why do you wear the royal crown?" Sir Garlon asked him as they sat at
table.

"The queen whom Lancelot and we all worship as the fairest, best and
purest gave it to me to wear," said Balin.

But Sir Garlon only hissed at him and made fun of what he said, and
Balin reached for a wonderful goblet embossed with a sacred picture to
hurl it at Garlon, but the thought of the gentle queen about whom he
was talking soothed his temper. The next morning, however, in the court
Sir Garlon mocked him again and Balin's face grew black with anger. He
tore out his sword from its shield and crying out fiercely, "Ha! I'll
make a ghost of you!" struck Garlon hard on the helmet.

The blade flew and splintered into six parts which clinked upon the
stones below while Garlon reeled slowly backward and fell. Balin dragged
him by the banneret of his helmet and struck again, but in a minute
twenty warriors with pointed lances were making for him from the castle.
Balin dashed his fist against the foremost face then dipped through a
low doorway out along a glimmering gallery until he saw the open portals
of King Pellam's chapel. He slipped inside this and crept behind the
door while the others howled past outside.

Before the golden altar he noticed lying the brightest lance he had ever
seen with its point painted red with blood. Seizing it he pushed it out
through an open casement, leaned on it and leaped in a half-circle to
the ground outside. Running along a path he found his horse, mounted him
and scudded away. An arrow whizzed to his right, another to his left and
a third over his head while he heard Pellam crying out feebly, "Catch
him, catch him! he mustn't pollute holy things!"

But Balin quickly dove beneath the tree boughs and raced through miles
of thick groves and open meadowland until his good horse, at last
wearied and uncertain in his footsteps, stumbled over a fallen oak and
threw Balin headlong.

As Balin rose to his feet he looked at the Queen's crown on his shield
and then drew the shield from off his neck. "I have shamed you," he
cried. "I won't carry you any more," and he hung it up on a branch and
threw himself on the ground in a passionate sleep.

While he slept there the beautiful wicked Vivien came riding by through
the woodland alleys with her squire, warbling a song.

"What is this?" she cried as she noticed the shield on the tree, "a
shield with a crown upon it. And there's a horse. Where's the rider? Oh!
there he is sleeping. Hail royal knight, I'm flying away from a bad king
and the knight I was riding with was hurt, and my poor squire isn't of
much use in helping me. But you, Sir Prince, will surely guide me to the
Warrior King Arthur, the Blameless, to get me some shelter."

"Oh, no, I'll never go to Arthur's court again," cried Balin. "I'm not a
prince any more, or a knight. I have brought the Queen's crown to
shame."

Then Vivien laughed shrilly, and told Balin a wicked story about the
Queen which she just imagined in her wicked mind. But she told it so
cunningly and smiled so sunnily as she talked that Balin believed her
and he flew into the more passionate rage because he thought he had been
deceived in the Queen whom he had worshipped.

He ground his teeth together, sprang up with a yell, tore the shield
from the branch and cast it on the ground, drove his heel _into the
royal crown_, stamped and trampled upon it until it was all spoiled,
then hurled the shield from him out among the forest weeds and cursed
the story, the queen and Vivien.

His weird yell had thrilled through the woods where Balan was lurking
for his foe. "There! that's the scream of the wood-devil I'm looking
for," he thought. "He has killed some knight and trampled on his shield
to show his loathing of our order and the queen. Devil or man,
whichever you are, take care of your head!"

[Illustration: HE DROVE HIS HEEL INTO THE ROYAL CROWN.]

With that he made swiftly for his poor brother whom he did not
recognize. Sir Balin spoke not a word but snatched the buckler from
Vivien's squire, vaulted on his horse and in a moment had clashed with
his brother's armor. King Pellam's holy spear reddened with blood as it
pricked through Balan's shield to his flesh. Then Balin's horse, wearied
to death, rolled back over his rider and crushed him inward and both men
fell and swooned away.

"The fools!" cried Vivien to her young squire. "Come, you Sir Chick,
loosen their casques and see who they are. They must be rivals for the
same woman to fight so hard."

"They are happy," her gentle squire answered, "if they died for love.
And Vivien, though you beat me like your dog I would die for you."

"Don't die, Sir Boy," cried Vivien, "I'd rather have a live dog than a
dead lion. Come away, I don't like to look at them," and she made her
palfrey leap off over the fallen oak tree.

Balin was the first to wake from his swoon. As soon as he saw his
brother's face he crawled over to his side moaning. Then Balan faintly
opened his eyes and seeing who was with him kissed Balin's forehead.

"O Balin," he cried, "why didn't you carry your own shield which I knew,
and why did you trample all over this one which bears the queen's own
crown which I know?"

So Balin slowly gasped out the whole story of his shield. Then they each
said good-night to the other and closed their eyes, locked in each
other's arms.




LANCELOT AND ELAINE.


Long before Arthur was crowned king while he was roving one night over
the trackless realms of Lyonesse he came upon a glen with a gray boulder
and a lake. As he rode up the highway in the misty moonshine he suddenly
stepped upon a white skeleton of a man with a crown of diamonds upon its
skull. The skull broke off from the body and rolled away into the lake.
Arthur alighted, reached down and picked up the crown and set it on his
head murmuring to himself, "_You too shall be king some day_," for the
skeleton was the bones of a king who had fought with his brother there
and been killed.

[Illustration: YOU TOO SHALL BE KING SOME DAY.]

When Arthur was crowned he plucked the nine gems out of the crown he had
found on the skeleton and showed them to his knights with the words:

"These jewels belong to the whole kingdom for everybody's use and not to
the king. Hereafter there is to be joust for one of them every year and
in that way in nine years time we will learn who is the mightiest in the
kingdom and we will race with each other to become skilful in the use
of arms until at last we shall be able to drive away the heathen horde
from the land."

Eight years had now passed and there had been eight jousts. Lancelot had
won the diamond every year and intended when he had been victorious in
all the jousts, to give the nine gems to the queen. When the ninth year
came Arthur proclaimed the tournament for the central and largest
diamond to be held at Camelot, where he was holding his court. But the
queen became ill as the time for the tour jousts drew near and he asked
her whether she was too feeble to go to see Lancelot in the lists.

"Yes, my lord," replied Guinevere, "and you know it," and she looked up
languidly to Lancelot who stood near.

Lancelot thinking that she would rather have him near while she was ill
than to receive all the diamonds of the crown, said:

"Sir King, that old wound of mine is not quite healed so I can hardly
ride in my saddle."

So the king went, excused Lancelot, and rode away alone to the lists
while Lancelot remained, but as soon as Arthur was gone the _queen told
Lancelot that he ought by all means go too and fight_.

"But how can I go now," replied Lancelot, "after what I have said to the
king."

"I will tell you what to do," said Guinevere. "Everybody says that men
go down before your spear just because of your great name. They are
afraid as soon as you appear and of course, they are conquered. Go in
today entirely unknown and win for yourself, then after all is over the
king will be pleased with you for being so clever."

[Illustration: THE QUEEN TOLD LANCELOT THAT HE OUGHT BY ALL MEANS
FIGHT.]

Lancelot quickly got his horse and leaving the beaten thoroughfare,
chose a green path among the downs to take him to the lists. It was a
new road to him however and he lost his way and did not know where to go
until at last he came upon a faintly traced pathway that led to the
castle of Astolat far away on a hill. He went thither, blew the horn at
the gate where a _dumb, wrinkled old man came to let him in_. In the
castle court he met the lord of Astolat with his two young sons, Sir
Torre and Sir Lavaine and behind them the lily maiden Elaine, Astolat's
daughter. They were jesting and laughing as they came.

[Illustration: A WRINKLED OLD MAN CAME AND LET HIM IN.]

"Where do you come from, my guest, and what is your name?" asked
Astolat. "By your state and presence I would guess you to be the chief
of Arthur's court, for I have seen him although the other knights of the
Round Table are strangers to me."

Lancelot, Arthur's chief knight replied, "I am of Arthur's court and I
am known, and my shield which I have happened to bring with me, is known
too. But as I am going to joust for the diamond at Camelot as a
stranger do not ask me my name. After it is over you shall know me and
my shield. If you have some blank shield around, or one with a strange
device, pray lend it to me."

"Here is Torre's," the Lord of Astolat replied. "He was hurt in his
first tilt and so his shield is blank enough, God knows. You can have
his."

"Yes," added Sir Torre simply, "since I can't use it you may have it."

His father laughed. "Fie, Churl, is that an answer for a noble knight?
You must pardon him, but Lavaine, my younger boy, is so full of life he
will ride in the lists, joust for the diamond, win and bring it in one
hour to set upon his sister's golden hair and make her three times as
wilful as before."

"Oh, no, good father! don't shame me before this noble knight. It was
all a joke. Elaine dreamed that some one had put the diamond into her
hand and it was so slippery it dropped into a pool of water. Then I told
her that if I fought and won it for her she must keep it safer than
that. But it was all in fun. However, if you'll give me your leave, I'll
ride to Camelot with this noble knight. I shall not win but I'll do my
best to win."

Lancelot smiled a moment. "If you'll give me the pleasure of your
company over the downs where I lost myself I'll be glad to have you as a
friend and guide. You shall win the diamond if you can and then give it
to your sister if you wish."

"Such diamonds are for queens and not for simple little girls," said Sir
Torre.

Elaine flushed at this and Lancelot said, "If beautiful things are for
beautiful people this maiden may wear as fine jewels as there are in the
world."

Then the lily maid lifted her eyes and thought that Lancelot was the
greatest man that had ever lived. She loved his bruised and bronzed face
seamed across with an old sword-cut.

They took the pet knight of Arthur's court into the rude hall of Astolat
where they entertained him with their best meats, wines and minstrel
melodies. They told him about the dumb old man at the gate, how ten
years ago he had warned Astolat of the heathen fighters coming, and how
they had all escaped to the woods and lived in a boatman's hut by the
river while the old man had been caught and had his tongue cut off.

"Those were dull days," said the Lord of Astolat, "until Arthur came and
drove the heathen away."

"O, great Lord!" cried Lavaine to Lancelot, "you fought in those
glorious wars with Arthur. Tell us about them!"

So Lancelot told him all about the fight all day long at the white mouth
of the river Glenn, the four loud battles on the shore of Duglas where
the glorious king wore on his cuirass an emerald carved into Our Lady's
head. "On the mount of Badon," he said, "I saw him charge at the head of
all of his Round Table and break the heathen hosts. Afterward he stood
on a heap of the killed, all red, from his spurs to the plumes of his
helmet, with their blood, and he cried to me: 'They are broken! they are
broken!' In this heathen war the fire of God filled him, I never saw
anyone like him, there is no greater leader."

"Except yourself," thought the lily maid Elaine. All through the night
she saw his dark, splendid face living before her eyes and early in the
morning she arose as if to bid goodbye to Lavaine, stole step after step
down the long tower stairs and passed out to the court where Lancelot
was smoothing the glossy shoulders of his horse. She drew nearer and
stood in the dewy light, studying his face as though it was a god. He
had never dreamed she was so beautiful.

[Illustration: "FAIR LORD," SAID ELAINE.]

"Fair lord," said Elaine, "I don't know your name but I believe it is
the noblest himself of them all. Will you wear a token of me at the
tournament today?"

"No, pretty lady," said he, "for I've never worn a token of any woman in
the lists; as every one who knows me knows."

"Then by wearing mine you'll be less likely to be found out this time."

"That's true, my child, well, I'll wear it. Fetch it out to me. What is
it?"

"A red sleeve bordered with pearls," replied Elaine, and she went in and
brought it out to him.

Then he wound it round his helmet and said he had never before done so
much for any girl in the world. The blood sprang to Elaine's face as he
said that, and filled her with delight, although she grew all the paler
as Lavaine came out and handed Sir Torre's shield to Lancelot. Lancelot
gave his own shield to Elaine saying, "Do me this favor, child, keep my
shield for me until I come back."

"It's a favor to me," she replied smiling, "I'll be your squire."

"Come, Lily Maid," cried Lavaine, "you'll be a lily maid in earnest if
you don't get to bed and have some sleep," and he kissed her good-bye.

Lancelot kissed her hand as they moved away. She watched them at the
gateway until their sparkling arms dipped below the downs, then climbed
up to her tower with the shield and there she studied it and mused over
it every day.

Meanwhile Lancelot and Lavaine passed far over the long downs until they
reached an old hermit who lived in a white rock. Here they spent the
night. The next morning as they rode away Lancelot said, "Listen to me,
but keep what I say a secret, you're riding with Lancelot of the Lake."

"The great Lancelot?" stammered Lavaine, catching his breath with
surprise. "There is only one other great man to see, and that is
Britain's king of kings, Arthur. And he's going to be at the tournament,
too."

As soon as they reached the lists in the meadows by Camelot, Lancelot
pointed out the king who, as he sat in the peopled gallery was very easy
to recognize because of his five dragons. A golden dragon clung to his
crown, another writhed down his robe while two others in gilded carved
wood-work formed the arms of his chair. The canopy above him blazed with
the last big diamond.

"You call me great," cried Lancelot, "I'm not great, there's the man."

Lavaine gaped at Arthur as if he were something miraculous. Then the
trumpets blew. The two sides, those who held the lists and those who
attacked them, set their lances in rest, then struck their spurs, moved
out suddenly and shocked in the center of the field. The ground shook
and there was a low thunder of arms. Lancelot waited a little until he
saw which was the weaker side, then sprang into the fight with them. In
those days of his glory, whomever he struck he overthrew, whether they
were kings, dukes, earls, counts or barons. But that day in the field
some of his relatives were holding the lists who did not know him and
who could not bear the idea that any stranger knight should out do the
feats of their own Lancelot.

"Who is this?" one of them asked, "Isn't it Lancelot?"

"When has Lancelot ever worn a lady's token?" the others replied.

"Who is it then?" they cried, furious to guard the name of Lancelot.
They pricked their steeds and moving all together bore down upon him
like a wild wave that upsets a ship. One spear lamed Lancelot's charger
and another pierced through Lancelot's side, snapped there and stuck.
Lavaine now did splendidly for he brought a famous old knight down by
Lancelot's side. Lancelot in the meantime rose to his feet in all his
agony and by a sort of miracle as it seemed to those who were on his
side, drove all his opponents back to the barrier. Then the trumpet blew
and proclaimed that the knight who wore the scarlet sleeve with pearls
was victor.

"Go up and get your diamond," his men said to him.

"Don't give me any diamonds," said Lancelot. "My prize is death, I'll
leave and don't follow."

Then he vanished into the poplar grove where he told Lavaine to draw out
the lance head.

"I'm afraid you'll die, if I do," cried Lavaine.

"I'm dying now with it," said Lancelot, so Lavaine drew it out and
Lancelot gave a wonderful shriek and swooned away.

Then the old hermit came out, carried him into the white rock and
stanched his wound.

Immediately after he had left the field the men of his side went to the
king and said that the knight who had won the day had left without
receiving his prize.

"Such a knight as that must not go uncared for," said the king. "Gawain,
ride out and find him and since he didn't come for his diamond we will
send it to him. Don't leave your quest until you have him."

Gawain the courteous was a good young knight but he didn't like it that
he had to leave the banquet and the king's side to look for a stranger
knight, so he mounted his horse rather crossly. He rode all round the
country to every place except the right one, poplar grove, and at last
very late reached the Castle of Astolat.

"What news from Camelot?" cried Elaine as soon as she saw him, "What
about the knight with the red sleeve?"

"He won."

"I knew it," she said.

"But he left the jousts wounded in his side."

Then Elaine almost swooned away. When the Lord of Astolat came out and
heard about Gawain's quest, "Stay with us, noble prince," said he. "For
the knight was here and left his shield with us, so he will certainly
come back or send for it. Besides my son is with him."

Gawain thought he would have a pleasant time with Elaine so he stayed.
But Elaine rebelled against his pretty love-making and asked him why he
neglected the king's quest and why he didn't ask to see the knight's
shield.

"I've lost my quest in the light of your blue eyes," said Gawain, "but
let me see the shield. Ah! the king was right!" he cried out when Elaine
showed it to him. "It was our Lancelot."

"I was right too," Elaine said merrily, "for I dreamed that my knight
was the greatest of them all."

"And suppose that I dreamed that you love this greatest knight?"
returned Gawain.

"What do I know?" Elaine answered simply. "I don't know whether I know
what love is, but I do know that if I do not love him there isn't
another man whom I can love."

"Yes, you love him well," said Gawain. "And I suppose you know just
where your greatest knight is hidden, so let me leave my quest with you.
If you love him it will be sweet to you to give him the diamond and if
he loves you it will be sweet to him to receive it from you, while even
if he doesn't love you, a diamond is always a diamond. Farewell a
thousand times. If he loves you I may see you at court after while."

Then Gawain lightly kissed her hand as he laid the diamond in it, and,
wearied of his quest, leaped on his horse and carrolling a love-ballad
airily rode away to the court where it was soon buzzed abroad that a
maid of Astolat loved Lancelot and that Lancelot loved a maid of
Astolat.

The maid meanwhile crept up to her father one day and received his leave
to take the diamond to Sir Lancelot. Sir Torre went with her to the
gates of Camelot where they saw Lavaine capering about on a horse.

"Lavaine!" she cried, "how is it with my lord Sir Lancelot?" and she
told him about the diamond. Then Sir Torre went on into the city while
Lavaine guided Elaine to the hermit's cave. As she saw her handsome
knight on the floor, a sort of skeleton of himself, she gave a little
tender dolorous cry.

"Your prize, the diamond, sent you by the king," said she, as she put it
into his hand and explained how she had received it from Gawain. Then he
kissed her as a father would kiss a dear little daughter and she went
back to the dim, rich city of Camelot for the night. But the next
morning she was back in the cave, and day after day she came, caring for
him more mildly, tenderly and kindly than any mother could with a child,
until at last the old hermit said she had nursed him back to life, then
all three rode back together one morning to Astolat where Lancelot asked
Elaine to tell him the dearest wish of her heart so that he could grant
it to her. Elaine turned as pale as a ghost when he first spoke but at
last one day she told him. She said she wanted him to love her, she
wanted to be his wife.

"If I had chosen to wed," Lancelot replied, slowly, "I would have been
married long before this. But now I shall never marry, sweet Elaine."

"No, no," cried Elaine, "it won't matter if I can't be your wife, if I
can only go with you always and go round the world with you and serve
you."

But Lancelot said that would be a poor way for him to requite the love
and kindness her father and brothers had shown him. "Noble maid," he
went on, "this is only the first flash of love with you. After awhile
you will smile at yourself about it when you find a knight who is fitter
for you to marry and not three times older than you as I am, and then I
will give you broad lands and territories even to a half of my kingdom
across the seas and I'll always be ready to fight for you in your
troubles. I'll do this, dear girl, but more I cannot."

"Of all this I care for nothing," Elaine said growing deathly pale and
falling in a swoon.

That evening Lancelot sent for his shield from the tower where Elaine
sat with it, and as his horse's hoofs clattered off upon the stone of
the highway she looked down from her tower, but he did not glance back.

After that Elaine dreamed her time sadly away in the tower and only
wished that she could die. She begged her father to send for the priest
to confess her and asked Lavaine to write a letter for her to Lancelot.
Then she arranged it that when she died the dumb old man at the gate was
to take her in the barge down the river to the king's palace. Eleven
days later this was done. Elaine was dressed like a little sleeping
queen and floated along the stream with her letter in one hand and a
lily in the other.

That day Lancelot was with the queen and as he looked out of the
casement upon the river he saw the barge hung with rich black samite,
the dumb old man and the lily maid of Astolat gliding up to the palace
door.

"What is it?" cried everybody streaming round. "A pale fairy queen come
to take Arthur to fairy land?"

Then the king bade meek Sir Percival and pure Sir Galahad carry her
reverently into the hall where the fine Gawain came and wondered at her
and Lancelot came and mused over her, and the queen came and pitied her.
But King Arthur spied a letter, opened it and read it aloud to all the
lords and ladies. It was Elaine's goodbye to Lancelot.

[Illustration: A PALE FAIRY QUEEN CAME TO TAKE ARTHUR TO FAIRY LAND.]

Then Sir Lancelot told them everything about Elaine and how he had
promised to give her his lands and riches when she should be ready to
marry some knight of her own age. The king said that he should see that
she was buried very grandly. So they had a procession with all the pomp
of a queen, with gorgeous ceremonies, mass and rolling music while all
the Order of the Round Table followed her to the tomb. Then they laid
the shield of Lancelot at her feet and put a lily in her hand.




THE HOLY GRAIL.


One day a new monk came into the abbey beyond Camelot. There was
something about him different from all the other monks there. He was so
polished and clever that old Ambrosious who had lived in the old
monastery for fifty years and had never seen a bit of the world guessed
in a minute that the new brother had come from King Arthur's court. And
one windy April morning as Ambrosious stood under the yew tree with this
gentle monk he asked him why he left the Knights of the Round Table.

Then Sir Percival answered:

"It was the sweet vision of the Holy Grail."

[Illustration: "THE HOLY GRAIL," CRIED AMBROSIOUS.]

"The Holy Grail," cried Ambrosious. "Heaven knows I don't know much, but
what is that, the phantom of a cup that comes and goes?"

"No, no," said Percival, "what phantom do you mean? It's the cup that
our Lord drank from at his sad last supper, and after he died Joseph of
Aramathea brought it to Glastonbury at Christmas time, and there it
stayed a while and every one who looked at it or touched it was healed
of their sicknesses. But the times grew so wicked that the cup was
caught up into heaven where nobody could see it."

"Yes, I remember reading in our old books," said Ambrosious, "how Joseph
built a lonely little church at Glastonbury on the marsh, but that was
long ago. Who first saw the vision of the Holy Grail to-day?"

"A woman," said Sir Percival, "a nun, my sister who was a holy maid if
ever there was one. The old man to whom she used to tell her sins (or
what she called her sins), often spoke to her about the legend of the
Holy Grail which had been handed down through six people, each of them a
hundred years old, from the Lord's time. And when Arthur made the order
of the Round Table and all hearts became clean and pure for a time this
old man thought surely the Holy Grail would come back again. 'O Christ!'
he used to say to my sister, 'if only it would come back and help all
the world of its wickedness!' And then my sister asked him whether it
might come to her by prayer and fasting.

"'Perhaps,' said the father, 'for your heart is as pure as snow.'

"So she prayed and fasted until the sun shone and the wind blew through
her and one day she sent for me. Her eyes were so beautiful with the
light of holiness that I did not know them.

"'Sweet Brother,' she said, 'I have seen the Holy Grail. I heard a sound
like a silver horn but sweeter than any music we can make, and then a
cold silver beam of light streamed in through my cell, and down the beam
stole the Holy Grail, rose red and throbbing as if it were alive. All
the walls of my cell grew rosy red with quivering rosy colors. Then the
music faded away, the Holy Grail vanished and the colors died out in
the darkness. So now we know the Holy Thing is here again, Brother fast,
too, and pray, and tell your brother-knights about it, then perhaps the
vision may be seen by you all, and the whole world will be healed.'

[Illustration: MY KNIGHT OF HEAVEN, GO FORTH.]

"So I told all the knights and we fasted and prayed for many weeks. Then
my sister cut off all her long streaming silken hair which used to fall
to her feet and out of it braided a strong sword belt and with silver
and crimson thread she wove into it a crimson grail in a silver beam.
Then she bound it on our beautiful boy knight, Sir Galahad, and said:

"'My knight of heaven, go forth, for you shall see what I have seen and
far in the spiritual city you will be crowned king.' Then she sent the
deathless passion of her eyes through him and he believed what she said.

"Then came a year of miracles. In our great hall there stood a chair
which Merlin had fashioned carved with strange figures like a serpent
and in and out among the strange figures ran a scroll of strange letters
in a language nobody knew like a serpent. Merlin called it the Seat
Perilous, because he said if any one sat in it he would get lost. And
Galahad said that if he got lost in it he would save himself. So one
summer night Sir Galahad sat down in the chair and all at once there was
a cracking of the roofs above us, and a blast and thunder, and in the
thunder there was a cry and in the blast there was a beam of light seven
times clearer than the daylight. Down the beam stole the Holy Grail all
covered over with a luminous cloud. Then it passed away but every knight
saw his brother knight's faces in a glory and we all rose and stared at
each other until at last I found my voice and swore a vow.

"I swore that because I had not seen the Holy Grail behind the cloud I
would ride away a year and a day in quest of it until I could see it as
my sister saw it. Galahad swore too, and good Sir Bors, and Lancelot and
many others, knights, and Gawain louder than all the rest.

"The king was not in the hall that day for he had gone out to help some
poor maiden, but as he came back over the plains beyond Camelot he saw
the roofs rolling in smoke and thought that his wonderfully dear,
beautiful hall which Merlin had built for him so wonderfully was afire.
So he rode fast and rushed into the tumult of knights and asked me what
it all meant.

"'Woe is me!' cried the king when I told him. 'Had I been here you would
not have sworn the vows.'

"'My king,' I answered boldly, had you been here you would have sworn
the vows yourself.'

"'Yes, yes,' said he, 'are you so bold when you didn't see the Grail?
You didn't see farther than the cloud, and what can you expect to see
now if you go out into the wilderness?'

"'No, no, Lord, I didn't see the Grail, I heard the sound, I saw the
light and since I didn't see the holy thing I swore the vow that I would
follow it until I did see.'

"'Then he asked us, knight by knight, whether we had seen it and each
one said, 'No, no, Lord, that was why we swore our vows,' but suddenly
Galahad called out, 'But I saw the Holy Grail, Sir Arthur, and heard the
cry, "O Galahad, follow me."'

"Ah, Galahad, Galahad,' said the king, 'the vision is for such as you
and for your holy nun but not for these. Are you all Galahads or all
Percivals? No, no, you are just men with the strength to right the
wrongs and violences of the land. But now since one has seen, all the
blind want to see. However, since you have made the vow, go. But oh, how
often the distressed people of the kingdom will come into the hall for
you to help them and all your chairs will be vacant while you are out
chasing a fire in the quagmire! Many of you, yes, most of you will never
come back again! But come to-morrow before you go, let us have one more
day of field sports so that before you go I can rejoice in the unbroken
strength of the Order I have made.'

"So the next day there was the greatest tournament that Camelot had ever
seen, and Galahad and I, with a strength which we had received from the
vision, overthrew so many knights that all the people cheered hotly for
Sir Galahad and Sir Percival. The next morning all the rich balconies
along the streets of Camelot were laden with ladies and showers of
flowers fell over us as we passed out and men and boys astride lions and
dragons, griffins and swans at the street corners, called us all by name
and cried, 'God Speed!' while many lords and ladies wept. Then we came
down to the gate of The Three Queens and there each one went on his own
way.

"I was feeling glad over my victories in the lists and thought the sky
never looked so blue nor the earth so green. All my blood danced within
me for I knew that I would see the Holy Grail. But after a while I
thought of the dark warning of the king. I looked about and saw that I
was quite alone in a sandy thorny place, and I thought I would die of
thirst. Then I came to a deep lawn with a flowing brook and apple trees
overhanging it. But while I was drinking of the water and eating of the
apples they all turned to dust, and I was alone and thirsty again in
among the sands and thorns. Next I saw a woman spinning beside a
beautiful house. She rose to greet me and stretched out her arms to
welcome me into her house to rest, but as soon as I touched her she fell
to dust, and the house turned into a shed with a dead baby inside, and
then it fell to dust too.

"Then I rode on and found a big hill and on the top was a walled city,
the spires with incredible pinnacles reaching up to the sky, and at the
gateway there was a crowd of people who cried out to me:

"Welcome, Percival, you mightiest and purest of men!"

"But when I reached the top there was no one there. I passed through to
the ruined old city and found only one person a very, very old man.
'Where is the crowd who called out to me?' I asked him.

"He could scarcely speak, but he gasped out, 'Where are you from and who
are you?' and then fell to dust.

[Illustration: NEXT I SAW A WOMAN SPINNING.]

"Then I was so unhappy I cried. I felt as though even if I should see
the Holy Grail itself and touched it it would crumble into dust. From
there I passed down into a deep valley, as low down as the city was
high up, where I found a chapel with a hermit in a hermitage near by. I
told him about all these phantoms.

"'You haven't true humility,' he said, 'which is the mother of all
virtue. You haven't lost yourself to find yourself as Galahad did.'

"Just as he ended suddenly Sir Galahad shone before us in silver armor.
He laid his lance beside the chapel door and we all went in and knelt in
prayer. Then my thirst was quenched. But when the mass was burned I saw
only the holy elements while Galahad saw the Holy Grail come down upon
the shrine.

"'The Holy Grail,' he said, 'has always been at my side ever since we
came away, fainter in the daytime, but blood-red at night. In its
strength I have overcome evil customs wherever I have gone, and have
passed through Pagan lands and clashed with Pagan hordes and broken them
down everywhere. But the time is very near now when I shall go into the
spiritual city far away where some one will crown me king. Come with me
for you will see the Holy Grail in a vision when I go.'

"At the close of the day I started away with him. We came to a hill
which only a man could climb, scarred all over with a hundred frozen
streams, and when we reached the top there was a wild storm. Galahad's
armor flashed and darkened again every instant with quick, thick
lightnings which struck the dead old tree trunks on every side until at
last they blazed into a fire. At the base was a great black swamp partly
whitened with bones of dead men. A chain of bridges lead across it to
the great sea, and Galahad crossed them, one after the other, but each
one burned away as soon as he had passed over so that I had to stay
behind. When he reached the great sea the Holy Grail hung over his head
in a brilliant cloud. Then a boat came swiftly by and when the sky
brightened again with the lightning I could see him floating away,
either in a boat with full sails or a winged creature which was flying,
I couldn't tell which. Above him hung the Holy Grail rosy red without
the cloud. I had seen the holy thing at last. When I saw Sir Galahad
again he looked like a silver star in the sky, and beyond the star was
the spiritual city with all her spires and gateways in a glory like one
pearl, no larger than a pearl. From the star a rosy red sparkle from the
Grail shot across to the city. But while I looked a flood of rain came
down in torrents, and how I ever came away I don't know, but anyway at
the dawn of the next day I had reached the little chapel again. There I
got my horse from the hermit and rode back to the gates of Camelot.

"Just once I met one of the other knights. That was one night when the
full moon was rising and the pelican of Sir Bors' casque made a shadow
on it. I spurred on my horse, hailed him and we were both very glad to
see each other.

"'Where is Sir Lancelot,' he asked. 'Have you seen him? Once he dashed
across me very madly, maddening his horse. When I asked him why he rode
so hotly on a holy quest he shouted, 'Don't keep me, I was a sluggard,
and now I'm going fast for there's a lion in the way.' Then he vanished.
When I saw how mad he was I felt very sad for I love him, and I cared no
more whether I saw the Holy Grail, or not; but I rode on until I came to
the loneliest parts of the country where some magicians told me I
followed a mocking fire. This vexed me and when the people saw that I
quarrelled with their priests they bound me and put me into a cell of
stones. I lay there for hours until one night a miracle happened. One
of the stones slipped away without any one touching it or any wind
blowing. Through the gap it made I saw the seven clear stars which we
have always called the stars of the Round Table and across the seven
stars the sweet Grail glided past. Close after a clap of thunder pealed.
Then a maiden came to me in secret and loosed me and let me go.'

[Illustration: ACROSS THE SEVEN STARS THE SWEET GRAIL GLIDED PAST.]

"Sir Bors and I rode along together and when we reached the city our
horses stumbled over heaps of ruined bits of houses that fell as they
trod along the streets. At last brought us to Arthur's hall.

"As we came in we saw Arthur sitting on his throne with just a tenth of
the knights who had gone out on the quest of the Holy Grail standing
before him, wasted and worn, also the knights who had stayed at home.
When he saw me he rose and said he was glad to see me back, that he had
been worrying about me because of the fierce gale that had made havoc
through the town and shaken even the new strong hall and half wrenched
the statue Merlin made for him.

"'But the quest,' the king went on, 'have you seen the cup that Joseph
brought long ago to Glastonbury?'

"Then when I told him all that you have been hearing just now and how I
was going to give up the tournament and tilt and pass into the quiet of
the life of the monk, he answered not a word, but turning quickly to
Gawain asked,

"'Gawain, was this quest for you?'

"'No, Lord,' replied Gawain, 'not for such as I. I talked with a saintly
old man about that and he made me very sure that it wasn't for me. I was
very tired of it. But I found a silk pavilion in the field with a lot of
merry girls in it, then this gale tore it off from the tenting pin and
blew my merry maidens all about with a great deal of discomfort. If it
hadn't been for that storm my twelve months and a day would have passed
very pleasantly for me.'

"Then Arthur turned to Sir Bors, who had pushed across the throng at
once to Lancelot's side, caught him by the hand and held it there half
hidden beside him until the king spied them.

"'Hail, Bors, if ever a true and loyal man could see the Grail you have
seen it,' cried Arthur.

"'Don't ask me about it,' replied Sir Bors with tears in his eyes 'I may
not speak about it; I saw it.'

"The others spoke only about the perils of their storm, and then it was
Lancelot's turn. Perhaps Arthur kept his best for the last.

"'My Lancelot,' said the king, 'our Strongest, has the quest availed for
you?'

"'Our strongest, O King!' groaned Lancelot and as he paused I thought I
saw a dying fire of madness in his eyes. 'O King, my friend, a sin lived
in me that was so strange that everything pure, noble and knightly in me
twined and clung around it until the good and the poisonous in me grew
together, and when your knights swore to make the quest I swore only in
the hope that could I see or touch the Holy Grail they might be pulled
apart. Then I spoke to a holy saint who said that if they could not be
plucked apart my quest would be all in vain. So I vowed to him that I
would do just as he told me, and while I was out trying to tear them
away from each other my old madness came back to me and whipped me off
into waste fields far away.

"There I was beaten down by little knights whom at one time I would have
frightened away just by the shadow of my spear. From there I rode over
to the sea-shore where such a blast of wind began to blow that you could
not hear the waves even although they were heaped up in mountains and
drove the sea like a cataract, while the sand on the beach swept by like
a river. A boat, half-swallowed by the seafoam, was moored to the shore
by a chain. I said to myself that I would embark in the boat and lose
myself and wash away my sin in the great sea.

"For seven days I rode around over the dreary water and on the seventh
night I felt the boat striking ground. In front of me rose the enchanted
towers of Carbonek, a castle like a rock upon a rock, with portals open
to the sea and steps that met the waves. A lion sat on each side of
them. I went up the steps and drew my sword. Suddenly flaring their
manes the lions stood up like men and gripped me on my shoulders. When I
was about to strike them a voice said to me, 'Don't be afraid, or the
beasts will tear you to pieces; go on.' Then my sword was dashed
violently from my hand and fell. Up into the sounding hall I passed but
saw not a bench, table, picture, shield or anything else except the moon
over the sea through the oriel window, but I heard a sweet voice as
clear as a lark singing in the topmost tower to the east. I climbed up a
thousand steps with great pain. It seemed as though I was climbing
forever but at last I reached a door with light shining through the
crannies and I heard voices singing 'Glory and joy and honor to our Lord
and the Holy Vessel, the Grail.'

"'Then I madly tried the door, it gave way and through a stormy glare of
heat that burned me and made me swoon away I thought I saw the Grail,
all veiled with crimson samite and around it great angels, awful shapes
and wings and eyes!'

"The long hall was silent after Lancelot was done, until airy Gawain
began with a sudden.

"'O King, my liege, my good friend Percival and your holy nun have
driven men mad. By my eyes and ears I swear I'll be deeper than a
blue-eyed cat and three times as blind as any owl at noon-time
hereafter to any holy virgins in their ecstasies.'

"'Gawain,' replied the king, 'don't try to become blinder; you're too
blind now to want to see. If a sign really came from heaven Bors,
Lancelot and Percival are blessed for they have each seen according to
their sight.'"




PELLEAS AND ETTARRE.


When his knights went after the Holy Grail Arthur made many new knights
to fill the gaps made by their absence. As he sat in his hall one day at
old Caerleon the high doors were softly parted and through these in came
a youth, and with him the outer sunshine and the sweet scent of meadows.

"Make me your knight, Sir King!" he cried, "because I know all about
everything that belongs to a knight and because I love a maiden."

This youth was Sir Pelleas-of-the-Isles who had heard that the king had
proclaimed a great tournament at Caerleon with a sword for the victor
and a golden crown for the victor's sweetheart as the prize. He longed
to win them, the circlet for his lady love, the sword for himself.

Just a few days before, while riding across the Forest of Dean to find
the king's palace hall at Caerleon, Pelleas had felt the sun beating on
his helmet so sharply that he reeled and almost fell from his horse.
Then, seeing a hillock near-by overgrown with stately beech trees and
flowers here and there beneath, he tied his horse to a tree, threw
himself down and was very soon lost in sweet dreams about a maiden, not
any particular maiden for he had no sweetheart at that time.

But suddenly he was wakened with a sound of chatter and laughing at the
outskirts of the grove, and glancing through fern he saw a party of
young girls in many colors like the clouds at sunset, all of them riding
on richly dressed horses. They were all talking together in a
hodgepodge, some pointing this way, some that, for they had lost their
way.

[Illustration: WAS VERY SOON LOST IN SWEET DREAMS ABOUT A MAIDEN.]

Pelleas sprang up, loosed his horse and led him into the light.

"Just in time!" cried the lady who seemed to be the leader of the party.
"See, our pilot-star! Youth, we are wandering damsels riding armed, as
you see, ready to tilt against the knights at Caerleon, but we've lost
our way. To the right? to the left? straight on? forward? backward?
which is it? tell us quickly."

Pelleas gazed at her and wondered to himself whether the famous Queen
Guinevere herself was as beautiful as this maiden. For her violet eyes,
scornful eyes, were large and the bloom on her cheeks was like the rosy
dawn. Her beauty made Pelleas timid and when she spoke to him he could
not answer but only stammered, for he had come from far away waste
islands where besides his sisters, he had scarcely known any women but
the tough wives of the islands who made fish nets.

With a slow smile the lady turned round to her companions the smile
spreading to them all. For she was Ettarre, a very great lady in her
land.

"O, wild man of the woods," she cried, "don't you understand our
language, or has heaven given you a beautiful face and no tongue?"

"Lady," he answered, "I just woke from my dreams, and coming out of the
gloomy woods I was dazzled by the sudden light, and beg your pardon. But
are you going to Caerleon? I'm going too. Shall I lead you to the king?"

"Lead," said she.

So through the woods they went together but his tender manner, his awe
of her and his bashfulness bothered her. "I've lighted on a fool," she
muttered to herself, "so raw and yet so stale!"

But since she wished to be crowned the Queen of Beauty in the king's
tournament, and since Pelleas looked strong she thought perhaps he would
fight for her, so she flattered him and was very pleasant and kind. Her
three knights and maidens were kind to him too, for she was a very
great lady and they had to do as she did. When they reached Caerleon
before she passed on to her lodgings she took Pelleas by the hand and
said:

[Illustration: SHE TOOK PELLEAS BY THE HAND.]

"O, how strong your hand is! See; look at my poor little weak one! Will
you fight for me and win me the crown, Pelleas, so that I may love you?"

Pelleas' heart danced. "Yes! Yes!" he cried, "and will you love me if I
win?"

"Yes, that I will," answered Ettarre laughing and flinging away his hand
as she peeped round to her knights and ladies until they all laughed
with her.

"O what a happy world!" thought glad Pelleas, "everybody seems happy and
I am the happiest of all."

He couldn't sleep that night for joy and on the next day when he was
knighted he swore to love one maiden only. As he came away from the
king's hall the men who met him all turned around to look at his face,
for it flamed with happiness, and at the great banquets which Arthur
gave to knights from all parts of the country Pelleas looked the noblest
of the noble. For he dreamed that his lady loved him and he knew that he
was loved by the king.

On the morning when the jousts began the first that was called was the
tournament of youth. Arthur wanted to keep the older, stronger men out
of it so that young Pelleas might win his lady's love as she had
promised, and be lord of the tourney. Down by the field along the river
Usk where it was held the gilded parapets were crowned with faces and
the great tower filled with eyes up to its top. Then the trumpets blew
for the tournament to begin.

All day long Sir Pelleas held the field. At the close a shout rang round
the galleries as Ettarre caught the gold crown from his lance and
crowned herself before all the people. Her eyes sparkled as she looked
at him, but that was the last time she was kind to her knight.

She lingered a few days at Caerleon, sunny to all the other people but
always frowning at him.

Still when she left for home with her knights and maidens Sir Pelleas
followed.

"Damsels," cried she as she saw him coming, "I ought to be ashamed to
say it and yet I can't bear that Sir Baby. Keep him back with
yourselves. I'd rather have some rough old knight who knows the ways of
the world to chatter and joke with; so don't let him come near me.
Tell him all sorts of baby fables that good mothers tell their little
boys, and if he runs off for us--it doesn't matter."

[Illustration: ETTARRE CROWNED HERSELF BEFORE ALL THE PEOPLE.]

So the young women didn't let him go near Ettarre but made him stay with
them, and as soon as they had all passed into Ettarre's castle gate up
sprang the drawbridge, down rang the iron grating, and Sir Pelleas was
left outside all alone.

"These are only the ways of ladies with their lovers when the ladies
want to find out whether the lovers are true or not. Well, she can try
me with anything, I'll be true through all."

So he stayed there until dark, then went to a priory not far off and the
next morning came back. Every day he did the same whether it rained or
shone, armed on his charger, and stayed all the day beneath the walls,
although nobody opened the gate for him.

This made Ettarre's scorn turn to anger. She told her three knights to
go out and drive him away. But when they came out Pelleas overthrew them
all as they dashed upon him one after the other. So they went back
inside and he kept his watch as before. This turned Ettarre's anger into
hate. As she walked on top of the walls with her three knights about a
week later she pointed down to Pelleas and said:

"He haunts me, look, he besieges me! I can't breathe. Strike him down,
put my hate into your blows and drive him away from my walls."

So down they went but Pelleas overthrew them all again so Ettarre called
down from the tower above, "Bind him and bring him in."

Pelleas heard her say this so he did not resist, but let the men bind
him and take him into his lady love. "See me, Lady," he said cheerily,
"your prisoner, and if you keep me in your dungeon here I'll be quite
content if you'll just let me see your face every day. For I've sworn my
vows and you've given me your promise and I know that when you've done
proving me you will give me your love and have me for your knight."

But she made fun of his vows and told her knights to put him outside
again and "if he isn't a fool to the middle of his bones," said she,
"he'll never come back." Then the three knights laughed and thrust him
out of the gates.

But a week later Ettarre called them again, "He's watching there yet. He
comes just like a dog that's been kicked out of his master's door. Don't
you hate him? Go after him, all of you at once, and if you don't kill
him bind him as you did before and bring him in."

So the three knights couched their spears all together, three against
one, ready to dash upon Pelleas, low down beneath the shadow of the
towers.

Gawain passing by on a lonely adventure saw them.

"The villains!" he shouted to Pelleas, "I'll strike for you!"

"No," cried Pelleas, "when one's doing a lady's will one doesn't need
any help."

Gawain stood by quivering to fight while the three knights sprang down
upon Pelleas, but Pelleas all alone beat the three of them together.
Then they rose to their feet, and he stood still while they bound him
and took him into their lady.

"You're scarcely fit to touch your victor, you dogs!" she cried to her
men, "far less bind him; but take him out as he is and let whoever wants
to untie him. Then if he comes again--"

She paused just a minute and Pelleas broke in at once with, "Lady, I
loved you and thought you very beautiful, but if you don't love me
don't trouble yourself about it; you won't see me again."

As soon as Pelleas was put outside the gate Gawain sprang forward,
loosed his bonds, flung them over the walls and cried out:

"My faith, and why did you let those wretches tie you up so when you
were victor of all the jousts?"

"O," said Pelleas, "they were just obeying the wishes of my lady, and
her wishes are mine."

Gawain laughed. "Lend me your horse and armor," he said, "and I'll tell
her I've killed you. Then she'll let me in just to hear all about it and
when I've made her listen I'll tell her all about you, what a great and
good fellow you are. Give me three days to melt her and on the third
evening I'll bring you golden news."

"Don't betray me," cried Pelleas, as he handed over his horse and all
his weapons except his sword. "Aren't you the knight they call
'Light-of-love?'"

"That is just because women are so light," Gawain rejoined, laughing.

Then he rode up to the castle gate, and blew the bugle so musically that
all the hidden echoes in the walls rang out.

"Away with you!" cried Ettarre's maidens, running up to the tower
window. "Our lady doesn't love you."

"I'm Gawain from Arthur's court," cried Gawain, lifting his vizor so
that they could see his face. "I've killed Pelleas whom you hate so.
Open the gates and I'll make you merry with my story."

The ladies ran down crying out to Ettarre, "Pelleas is dead! Sir Gawain
of Arthur's court has killed him and is blowing the bugle to come in to
tell us."

"Let him in," said Ettarre.

Then they opened the gates and Gawain rode inside.

For three days Pelleas wandered all about, doing nothing but thinking of
Gawain and Ettarre, and on the third night, when Gawain did not come, he
wondered why Gawain lingered with his golden news. At last he rode up to
Ettarre's castle, tied his horse outside and walked in through the wide
open gates. The court he found all dark and empty, not a light
glimmering from anywhere, so he passed out by the back gate, into the
large gardens beyond of red and white roses, where he saw three
pavilions. In one he found the three knights with their squires, all red
with revelling, and all asleep, in the second he saw the girls with
their scornful smiles frozen stiff in slumber, and in the third lay
Gawain with Ettarre, the golden crown he had won for her at the joust on
her forehead, both sleeping.

Pelleas drew back as if he had touched a snake.

"I'll kill them just as they lie," he cried in a passion. "O! to think
that any knight could be so false!"

But he was too manly to kill anyone in sleep, so he just laid his sword
across their throats and passed out to his horse, crushed his saddle
with his thighs, clenched his hands together and groaned.

"I loathe her now just as much as I loved her!" he cried, and dashing
his spurs into his horse he bounded out into the darkness and never came
back.

Meanwhile Ettarre, feeling the cold sword on her neck, awoke.

"Liar!" she cried to Gawain, as she saw that it was the sword of
Pelleas, "you haven't killed Pelleas, for he's been here and could have
killed us both just now."

And ever after that, as those who tell the story say, the proud and
scornful Ettarre sighed for Pelleas, the one true knight in the world,
her only faithful lover, and at last pined away because he never came
back.




THE LAST TOURNAMENT.


One day while King Arthur and Sir Lancelot were riding far, far beneath
a winding wall of rock they heard the wail of a child.

A half-dead oak tree climbed up the sides of the rock and up in mid-air
it held an eagle's nest. Through its branches rushed a rainy wind and
through the wind came the voice of a little child. Lancelot sprang up
the crag and from the nest at the tree-top he brought down a baby girl.
Round her neck was twined a necklace of rubies, wound round and round
three times.

Arthur took the baby and gave it to Queen Guinevere, who soon loved it
very tenderly and named her "Nestling." But Nestling had caught a
terrible cold in her strange little home in the wild eagle's nest and
died. And after that whenever the Queen looked at the ruby necklace it
made her very sad so she gave it to Arthur and said:

"Take these jewels of our Dead Innocence and make them a prize at a
tournament."

"Just as you wish," cried the King, "but why don't you wear the diamonds
that I found for you in the tarn, which Lancelot won for you at the
jousts?"

"Don't you know that they slipped out of my hands the very day that he
gave them to me, while I was leaning out of the window to see Elaine in
the barge on the river? But these rubies will bring better luck than
that to the lady who gets them, for they didn't come from a dead king's
skeleton, but from the body of a sweet baby girl. Perhaps, who knows,
the purest of your knights will win them at the jousts for the purest of
my ladies."

So the great jousts were proclaimed with trumpets that blew all along
the streets of Camelot and out across the faded fields to the farthest
towers, and everywhere the knights armed themselves for a day of glory
before the king.

But just the day before they were to be held, as King Arthur sat in his
great hall, a churl staggered in through the door; his face was all
striped with the lashes of a dog whip, his nose was broken, one eye was
out, a hand was off and the other hand dangled at his side with
shattered fingers.

"My poor Churl," cried the king, full of indignant pity, "what beast or
fiend has been after you? Or was it a man who hurt you so?"

"He took them all away," sputtered the churl, "a hundred good ones. It
was the Red Knight. He--Lord, I was tending sheep, my pigs, a hundred
good ones, and he drove them all off to his tower. And when I said that
you were always kind to poor churls like me as well as gentle lords and
ladies, he made for me and would have killed me outright if he didn't
want me to bring you message and made me swear that I would tell you.

"He said, 'Tell the king that I have made a Round Table of my own in the
North, and that whatever his knights swear not to do mine swear that
they will do; and tell him his hour has come, and that the heathen are
after him, and that his long lance is broken, and that his sword
Excalibur is a straw.'"

Then Arthur turned to Sir Kay the Seneschal and said: "Take this churl
of mine and tend him very carefully as if he were the son of a king
until all his hurts are healed," and as Sir Kay left the hall with the
churl the king went on to Lancelot: "The heathen have been quiet for a
long, long time, but now they are rising again in the North, and I will
go with my younger knights to put them down, so as to make the whole
island safe from one shore to the other. And while I go away, you, Sir
Lancelot, will sit in my chair to-morrow at the tournament and be the
judge there of the field. For why should you anyway care to go in again
yourself, when you've already won the nine diamonds for the queen?"

"Very well," replied Lancelot, "if you wish, although it would be better
if you would let me go off with the younger knights and you stay here
with the others and watch the tournament. But, if not, all is well?"

"Is all really well?" cried the king, "or have I just dreamed that our
knights are not quite so true and manly as they used to be and that my
noble realm which has been built up by noble deeds and noble vows is
going to fall back into beastly roughness and violence again?"

He gathered all the younger Knights of the Round Table together and
started away with them down the hilly streets of Camelot, and at the
gateway turned sharply North.

The next morning, the day of the Tournament, the Tournament of the Dead
Innocence they called it, a wet wind blew. But the streets were hung
with white samite, the fountains were filled with wine, and round each
fountain twelve little girls, all dressed in purest white sat with the
cups of gold and gave drinks to all that passed. The stately galleries
were filled with white-robed ladies. Lancelot mounted the steps to the
king's dragon-carved chair, the trumpets blew and the jousts began.

[Illustration: TWELVE LITTLE GIRLS GAVE DRINK TO ALL WHO PASSED.]

But Lancelot did not think of the sport before him, he was dreaming over
and over again the words of the king about the kingdom, and many rules
of the tournament were broken, and he didn't say a word. Once one of the
knights, who was overthrown cursed the little baby girl, the dead
innocence, and the king, and once one of the knight's helmets became
unlaced and the wicked face of Modred peeped through like a vermin, but
Lancelot didn't see.

After a while a roar of welcome shouted all round the galleries and
lists as a new knight came in dressed from his head to his feet in green
armor all trimmed with tiny silver deer, with holly berries on his
helmet crest. It was Sir Tristram of the Woods who had just crossed over
the seas from Brittany. Lancelot had fought with him long ago and
conquered him, and now he saw him and longed to fight him again. As
many, many knights of the Round Table fell down before the new knight
Lancelot gripped the golden dragons on each side of his throne to keep
himself in his seat, and groaned with passion. "Craven crests! oh,
shame!" he muttered, "the glory of the Round Table is gone."

So Tristram won the jousts and Sir Lancelot gave him the jewels.

"The hands with which you take these rubies are red," he said as he put
the necklace in Tristram's hands.

Then the thick rain began to fall, the plumes on the helmets of the
knights drooped and the dresses of the ladies were mussed. When they
went inside to feast the ladies took off their pure white gowns and
robed themselves in all the colors of the rainbow and field flowers,
like poppies, blue-bells, kingcups, and one said she was glad the time
to wear the pure innocent simple white was over. They grew so loud in
their frolics that at last the queen, who was angry that Sir Tristram
had won the prize and angry with the lawless youths, broke up the
banquet.

The next morning as Sir Tristram stood before the hall little Dagonet,
the fool, came dancing along and Sir Tristram threw his rubies round
the little fool's neck as he skipped about like a withered leaf, asking
him why he danced.

"It's stupid to dance without music," Tristram said, and picked up his
harp and began to twangle a tune on it; but as soon as Sir Tristram
began to play Dagonet stopped his dance. "And why don't you go on
skipping, Sir Fool?" asked Tristram.

"Because I'd rather skip twenty years to the music of my little brain
than skip a minute to the broken music you make."

"And what music have I broken?" cried Sir Tristram. "Arthur the King's
music," cried little Dagonet, skipping again and again as Sir Tristram
ceased. Then down the city he danced all the way, while Sir Tristram
passed out into the lonely avenues of the forests. He rode on toward
Lyonesse and the West, thinking of Isolt, the White, whom he loved, and
how he would put the rubies round her neck.

[Illustration: LITTLE DAGONET SKIPPING AGAIN AND AGAIN.]

Arthur, meanwhile, with his hundred spearmen had gone far, far away,
until at last over the countless reeds of marshes and islands he saw a
huge tower glaring in the wide-winged sunset of the West. As he drew
near he saw that the tower doors stood open and heard roars of rioting
and wicked songs of ruffian men and women.

"Look," cried one of his knights, for there high on a grim dead tree
before the tower, a brother of the Round Table was swinging by his neck,
his shield flowing with a shower of blood on a branch near by.

All the knights wanted to dash forward and blow the great horn that hung
beside the gate, but Arthur waved them back and went himself. He blew so
hard that the horn roared until all the grasses of the marshes flared
up, and out of the castle gate sallied a knight dressed from tip to toe
in blood-red arms, the Red Knight.

"Aren't you the king?" he bellowed, "the king that keeps us all with
such strict vows that we can't have any pleasures, a milky-hearted king?
Look to your life now!"

Arthur scorned to speak to so vile a man or to fight him with his sword.
He simply let the drunkard, stretching out from his horse to strike,
fall head-heavy, over from the castle causeway to the swamp below.

Then all the Round Table Knights roared and shouted, leaped down on the
fallen man, trampled out his face in the mire, sank his head so that it
could not be seen, and, still shouting, sprang through the open doors
among the people within. They hurled their swords right and left on men
and women, hurled over the tables and the wines and slew and slew until
all the rafters rang with yells and all the pavements streamed with
blood. Then they set the tower all afire and half the night through it
flushed the long low meadows and marshlands and lazily plunging sea with
its flames. That was how Arthur made the ways of the island safe from
one shore to the other.

Sir Tristram, not many nights after, reached Tintagil, where Isolt, the
White, lived in a crown of towers, where she now sat with the low
sea-sunset glorying her hair and glossy throat, thinking of him and of
Mark, her Cornish lord.

When Tristram's footsteps came grinding up the tower steps she flushed,
started out to meet him and threw her white arms about him.

"Not Mark, not Mark!" she cried. "At first your footsteps fluttered me,
for Mark steals into his own castle like a cat."

"No, it's I," said Sir Tristram, "and don't think about your Mark any
more, for he isn't yours any longer."

"But listen," she cried, "to-day he went away for a three days' hunt, he
said, and that means that he may be back in an hour for that's his way.
My God, my hate for him is as strong as my love for you. Let me tell you
how I sat here one evening thinking of you, one black midsummer night,
all alone, dreaming of you, and sometimes speaking your name aloud, when
suddenly there Mark stood behind me, for that's his way to steal behind
one in the dark.

"'Tristram has married her!' he hissed out and then this tower shook
with such a roar that I swooned away."

"Come," cried Sir Tristram, laughing, "never mind, I'm hungry, give me
some meat and wine."

So they ate and drank, talked and laughed about Mark with his long
crane-like legs, and Sir Tristram took a harp and sang a song. Then
while the last light of the day glimmered away he swung the ruby
necklace before Isolt.

"It's the fruit of a magical oak-tree that grew mid air," he cried, "and
was won by Sir Tristram as a tourney prize to bring to you."

Flinging the rubies round her neck he had just touched her jeweled
throat with his lips when behind him rose a shadow and a shriek.

"Mark's way!" cried Mark, the Cornish king, and he clove Tristram
through the brain.

       *       *       *       *       *

That very night Arthur came back from the North, and as he climbed up
the tower steps to go to the queen, in the dark of the tower something
pulled at him. It was little Dagonet.

"Who are you?" said the king.

"I'm little Dagonet, your fool," sobbed the little jester, "and I cry
because I can never make you laugh again."




THE PASSING OF ARTHUR.


One night King Arthur saw Sir Gawain in a dream, and Gawain, who had
been killed, shrilly called out to him through the wind:

"Hail King! to-morrow you are going to pass away, and there's a land of
rest for you. Farewell!"

But when Arthur told his dream to Sir Bedivere, good old Sir Bedivere
replied, "Don't mind what dreams tell you, but get your knights together
and go out to the West to meet Sir Modred, who has stirred up against
you so many of the knights you love. They all know in their hearts that
you are king. Go and conquer them as of old."

So the king took his army by night and pushed upon Modred league after
league, until they reached the Western part of Lyonesse where the long
mountains ended in the moaning sea. There Modred's men could flee no
farther, so on the waste lands by the barren sea they began that last
dim weird battle of the West.

A white chill mist slept over all the land and water so that even Arthur
became confused since he could not see which were his friends and which
were his foes. Friends killed friends, some saw the faces of old ghosts
looking in upon the battle. Spears were splintered, shields were broken,
swords clashed, helmets were shattered, men shrieked and looked up to
heaven for help but saw only the white, white mists. There were cries
for light and moans.

At last toward the close of the day a hush fell over the whole shore; a
bitter wind from the North blew the mist aside and the pale king looked
across the battlefield. But no one was there only the waves breaking in
among the dead faces.

But bold Bedivere said: "My King! the man who hates you stands there,
Modred, the traitor of your house!"

"Don't call this traitor a person of my house," the king replied. "The
men of my house are not those who have lived under one roof with me, but
those who always call me their king."

With that, Arthur dashed after Modred. Modred struck at the king's
helmet, which had grown thin with all his heathen wars. Arthur with his
sword Excalibur struck Modred dead, then fell down himself almost killed
with the wound through his helmet.

Sir Bedivere lifted him up and carried him to a chapel near by.

"Take my sword, Excalibur," said the King, "and fling it out into the
middle of the sea, watch what happens to it and then come back at once
and tell me."

"It doesn't seem right to leave you all alone here," said Sir Bedivere,
"when you are wounded and ill, but since you wish me to go, I will, and
will do all that you have told me."

He slipped away by zigzag paths, points and jutting rock to the shining
level of the sea. There he drew out the sword Excalibur. The winter moon
sparkled against its hilt and made it twinkle with its diamond sparks,
with myriads of topaz lights and fine jewelry work. Bedivere gazed so
long at it that both his eyes were dazzled as he stood, and he wondered
whether he ought to throw away so beautiful a thing. At last he decided
to hide it away among the water-flags that grew along shore.

"Did you do as I said?" asked the king, when he saw him. "What did you
see?"

"I heard the ripple washing in the reeds," said Sir Bedivere, "and the
wild water lapping on the rock."

"You are not giving me a true answer," said the king, faint and pale.
"It's shameful for men to lie. Quickly go again and as you are true and
dear, do just as I bade you. Watch and bring me word."

Then Sir Bedivere went the second time and paced up and down beside the
pebbly water, counting the dewey pebbles, but when he saw the wonderful
sword he clapped his hands together and cried:

"If I threw that sword away, a precious thing will be lost forever. The
King is ill; he does not know what he is doing. His great sword ought to
be kept, then in long years hereafter people will look at it at the
tournament and they will say: 'This was the great Arthur's sword
Excalibur which was made by the lonely lady of the Lake, working in the
deep sea for nine years.'"

So the second time he hid Excalibur and strode very slowly back to the
king.

"What did you see or what did you hear?" asked Arthur breathing very
heavily.

"I heard the water lapping on the rock and the long ripples washing in
the reeds."

"Unkind! miserable! untrue! unknightly!" cried Arthur, filled with
anger. "I see what you are, for you are the only one left me of all the
knights, yet you would betray me for my sword, either to sell it or like
a girl, because you love its beauty. Go out now the third time and if
you do not throw out my sword Excalibur I'll get up and kill you with my
hands."

At this Sir Bedivere sprang up like a flash and ran down leaping lightly
over the ridges, plunged into the beds of bulrushes, clutched the sword,
wheeled it round strongly and threw it as far as he could.

Excalibur made lightning in the moonlight as it flashed round and round
and whirled in an arch, shooting far out to the water. But before it
quite dipped into the sea an arm robed in white samite, mystic and
wonderful, rose out of the waves, caught it by the hilt, brandished it
three times and drew it under.

"Now I can see by your eyes that you have done it!" cried the King.
"Speak out; what have you seen or heard?"

"Sir King," cried Sir Bedivere, "I closed my eyes when I picked it up so
that I would not be turned from my purpose of throwing it into the
water, for I could live three lives, Sir King, and I wouldn't again see
such a wonderful thing as your sword. Sir, I threw it out with both
hands, wheeling it round and when I looked an arm robed in white samite
reached up out of the water and caught it by the hilt, brandished it
three times and drew it under."

"Carry me to the shore," said the king.

[Illustration: AN ARM ROBED IN WHITE SAMITE.]

So Bedivere lifted him up and walked as swiftly as he could from the
ridge, heavily, heavily down to the beach. As they reached the shore
they saw a black barge beside the water filled with stately people all
dressed in black. Among the people were three queens wearing crowns of
gold.

"Put me into the barge," cried Arthur.

So they came to the barge and the three queens held out their hands and
took the king.

The tallest and fairest of them held his head upon her lap loosed his
shattered helmet and chafed his hands, and moaned tenderly over him.

"Ah, my lord Arthur," cried Sir Bedivere, "where shall I go now? For
the old times are past now and the whole Round Table is broken."

"Go and pray," cried the king. "Farewell, for I am going a very long way
to the lovely Island-valley of Avilion where it will never hail nor rain
nor snow, and where the loud winds never blow. It lies in deep meadows,
beautiful with lawns and fruit trees and flowery glens."

Then the barge set sail and oar, and moved away from the shore.

"The king is gone!" groaned Bedivere.

He walked away from the shore and climbed up to the highest peaks and
ridges about him and looked far, far away. And from far away out beyond
the world he thought he heard sounds from a beautiful city as if every
one in it all together were welcoming a great King who had just come
back from his wars.

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

THE LAST TOURNAMENT

BY

ALFRED TENNYSON, D.C.L.,

POET-LAUREATE

AUTHOR'S EDITION

FROM ADVANCE SHEETS

This poem forms one of the "Idyls of the King." Its place
is between "Pelleas" and "Guinevere."

BY ALFRED TENNYSON,

POET LAUREATE

   Dagonet, the fool, whom Gawain in his moods
 Had made mock-knight of Arthur's Table Round,
 At Camelot, high above the yellowing woods,
 Danced like a wither'd leaf before the Hall.
 And toward him from the Hall, with harp in hand,
 And from the crown thereof a carcanet
 Of ruby swaying to and fro, the prize
 Of Tristram in the jousts of yesterday,
 Came Tristram, saying, "Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?"

   For Arthur and Sir Lancelot riding once
 Far down beneath a winding wall of rock
 Heard a child wail. A stump of oak half-dead,
 From roots like some black coil of carven snakes
 Clutch'd at the crag, and started thro' mid-air
 Bearing an eagle's nest: and thro' the tree
 Rush'd ever a rainy wind, and thro' the wind
 Pierced ever a child's cry: and crag and tree
 Scaling, Sir Lancelot from the perilous nest,
 This ruby necklace thrice around her neck,
 And all unscarr'd from beak or talon, brought
 A maiden babe; which Arthur pitying took,
 Then gave it to his Queen to rear: the Queen
 But coldly acquiescing, in her white arms
 Received, and after loved it tenderly,
 And named it Nestling; so forgot herself
 A moment, and her cares; till that young life
 Being smitten in mid-heaven with mortal cold
 Past from her; and in time the carcanet
 Vext her with plaintive memories of the child:
 So she, delivering it to Arthur, said,
 "Take thou the jewels of this dead innocence,
 And make them, an thou wilt, a tourney-prize."

   To whom the King, "Peace to thine eagle-borne
 Dead nestling, and this honor after death,
 Following thy will! but, O my Queen, I muse
 Why ye not wear on arm, or neck, or zone,
 Those diamonds that I rescued from the tarn,
 And Lancelot won, methought, for thee to wear."

   "Would rather ye had let them fall," she cried,
 "Plunge and be lost--ill-fated as they were,
 A bitterness to me!--ye look amazed,
 Not knowing they were lost as soon as given--
 Slid from my hands, when I was leaning out
 Above the river--that unhappy child
 Past in her barge: but rosier luck will go
 With these rich jewels, seeing that they came
 Not from the skeleton of a brother-slayer,
 But the sweet body of a maiden babe.
 Perchance--who knows?--the purest of thy knights
 May win them for the purest of my maids."

   She ended, and the cry of a great jousts
 With trumpet-blowings ran on all the ways
 From Camelot in among the faded fields
 To furthest towers; and everywhere the knights
 Arm'd for a day of glory before the King.

   But on the hither side of that loud morn
 Into the hall stagger'd, his visage ribb'd
 From ear to ear with dogwhip-weals, his nose
 Bridge-broken, one eye out, and one hand off,
 And one with shatter'd fingers dangling lame,
 A churl, to whom indignantly the King,
 "My churl, for whom Christ died, what evil beast
 Hath drawn his claws athwart thy face? or fiend?
 Man was it who marr'd Heaven's image in thee thus?"

   Then, sputtering thro' the hedge of splinter'd teeth,
 Yet strangers to the tongue, and with blunt stump
 Pitch-blacken'd sawing the air, said the maim'd churl,
 "He took them and he drave them to his tower--
 Some hold he was a table-knight of thine--
 A hundred goodly ones--the Red Knight, he--

 "Lord, I was tending swine, and the Red Knight
 Brake in upon me and drave them to his tower;
 And when I call'd upon thy name as one
 That doest right by gentle and by churl,
 Maim'd me and maul'd, and would outright have slain,
 Save that he sware me to a message, saying--
 'Tell thou the King and all his liars, that I
 Have founded my Round Table in the North,
 And whatsoever his own knights have sworn
 My knights have sworn the counter to it--and say
 My tower is full of harlots, like his court,
 But mine are worthier, seeing they profess
 To be none other than themselves--and say
 My knights are all adulterers like his own,
 But mine are truer, seeing they profess
 To be none other; and say his hour is come,
 The heathen are upon him, his long lance
 Broken, and his Excalibur a straw.'"

   Then Arthur turn'd to Kay the seneschal,
 "Take thou my churl, and tend him curiously
 Like a king's heir, till all his hurts be whole.
 The heathen--but that ever-climbing wave,
 Hurl'd back again so often in empty foam,
 Hath lain for years at rest--and renegades,
 Thieves, bandits, leavings of confusion, whom
 The wholesome realm is purged of otherwhere,--
 Friends, thro' your manhood and your fealty,--now
 Make their last head like Satan in the North.
 My younger knights, new-made, in whom your flower
 Waits to be solid fruit of golden deeds,
 Move with me toward their quelling, which achieved,
 The loneliest ways are safe from shore to shore.
 But thou, Sir Lancelot, sitting in my place
 Enchair'd to-morrow, arbitrate the field;
 For wherefore shouldst thou care to mingle with it,
 Only to yield my Queen her own again?
 Speak, Lancelot, thou art silent: is it well?"

        *       *       *       *       *

   Thereto Sir Lancelot answer'd, "It is well:
 Yet better if the King abide, and leave
 The leading of his younger knights to me.
 Else, for the King has will'd it, it is well."

         *       *       *       *       *

   Then Arthur rose and Lancelot follow'd him,
 And while they stood without the doors, the King
 Turn'd to him saying, "Is it then so well?
 Or mine the blame that oft I seem as he
 Of whom was written, 'a sound is in his ears'--
 The foot that loiters, bidden go,--the glance
 That only seems half-loyal to command,--
 A manner somewhat fall'n from reverence--
 Or have I dream'd the bearing of our knights
 Tells of a manhood ever less and lower?
 Or whence the fear lest this my realm, uprear'd,
 By noble deeds at one with noble vows,
 From flat confusion and brute violences,
 Reel back into the beast, and be no more?"

        *       *       *       *       *

   He spoke, and taking all his younger knights,
 Down the slope city rode, and sharply turn'd
 North by the gate. In her high bower the Queen,
 Working a tapestry, lifted up her head,
 Watch'd her lord pass, and knew not that she sigh'd.
 Then ran across her memory the strange rhyme
 Of bygone Merlin, "Where is he who knows?
 From the great deep to the great deep he goes."

        *       *       *       *       *

   But when the morning of a tournament,
 By these in earnest those in mockery call'd
 The Tournament of the Dead Innocence,
 Brake with a wet wind blowing, Lancelot,
 Round whose sick head all night, like birds of prey,
 The words of Arthur flying shriek'd, arose,
 And down a streetway hung with folds of pure
 White samite, and by fountains running wine,
 Where children sat in white with cups of gold,
 Moved to the lists, and there, with slow sad steps
 Ascending, fill'd his double-dragon'd chair.

        *       *       *       *       *

   He glanced and saw the stately galleries,
 Dame, damsel, each thro' worship of their Queen
 White-robed in honor of the stainless child,
 And some with scatter'd jewels, like a bank
 Of maiden snow mingled with sparks of fire.
 He lookt but once, and veil'd his eyes again.

         *       *       *       *       *

   The sudden trumpet sounded as in a dream
 To ears but half-awaked, then one low roll
 Of Autumn thunder, and the jousts began:
 And ever the wind blew, and yellowing leaf
 And gloom and gleam, and shower and shorn plume
 Went down it. Sighing weariedly, as one
 Who sits and gazes on a faded fire,
 When all the goodlier guests are past away,
 Sat their great umpire, looking o'er the lists.
 He saw the laws that ruled the tournament
 Broken, but spake not; once, a knight cast down
 Before his throne of arbitration cursed
 The dead babe and the follies of the King;
 And once the laces of a helmet crack'd,
 And show'd him, like a vermin in its hole,
 Modred, a narrow face: anon he heard
 The voice that billow'd round the barriers roar
 An ocean-sounding welcome to one knight,
 But newly-enter'd, taller than the rest,
 And armor'd all in forest green, whereon
 There tript a hundred tiny silver deer,
 And wearing but a holly-spray for crest,
 With ever-scattering berries, and on shield
 A spear, a harp, a bugle--Tristram--late
 From overseas in Brittany return'd,
 And marriage with a princess of that realm,
 Isolt the White--Sir Tristram of the Woods--
 Whom Lancelot knew, had held sometime with pain
 His own against him, and now yearn'd to shake
 The burthen off his heart in one full shock
 With Tristram ev'n to death: his strong hands gript
 And dinted the gilt dragons right and left,
 Until he groan'd for wrath--so many of those,
 That ware their ladies' colors on the casque,
 Drew from before Sir Tristram to the bounds,
 And there with gibes and nickering mockeries
 Stood, while he mutter'd, "Craven chests! O shame!
 What faith have these in whom they sware to love?
 The glory of our Round Table is no more."

        *       *       *       *       *

   So Tristram won, and Lancelot gave, the gems,
 Not speaking other word than "Hast thou won?
 Art thou the purest, brother? See, the hand
 Wherewith thou takest this is red!" to whom
 Tristram, half plagued by Lancelot's languorous mood,
 Made answer, "Ay, but wherefore toss me this
 Like a dry bone cast to some hungry hound?
 Let be thy fair Queen's fantasy. Strength of heart
 And might of limb, but mainly use and skill,
 Are winners in this pastime of our King.
 My hand--belike the lance hath dript upon it--
 No blood of mine, I trow; but O chief knight,
 Right arm of Arthur in the battlefield,
 Great brother, thou nor I have made the world;
 Be happy in thy fair Queen as I in mine."
 And Tristram round the gallery made his horse
 Caracole; then bow'd his homage, bluntly saying,
 "Fair damsels, each to him who worships each
 Sole Queen of Beauty and of love, behold
 This day my Queen of Beauty is not here."
 Then most of these were mute, some anger'd, one
 Murmuring "All courtesy is dead," and one,
 "The glory of our Round Table is no more."

   Then fell thick rain, plume droopt and mantle clung,
 And pettish cries awoke, and the wan day
 Went glooming down in wet and weariness:
 But under her black brows a swarthy dame
 Laught shrilly, crying "Praise the patient saints,
 Our one white day of Innocence hath past,
 Tho' somewhat draggled at the skirt. So be it.
 The snowdrop only, flow'ring thro' the year,
 Would make the world as blank as wintertide.
 Come--let us comfort their sad eyes, our Queen's
 And Lancelot's, at this night's solemnity
 With all the kindlier colors of the field."

        *       *       *       *       *

   So dame and damsel glitter'd at the feast
 Variously gay: for he that tells the tale
 Liken'd them, saying "as when an hour of cold
 Falls on the mountain in midsummer snows,
 And all the purple slopes of mountain flowers
 Pass under white, till the warm hour returns
 With veer of wind, and all are flowers again;"
 So dame and damsel cast the simple white,
 And glowing in all colors, the live grass,
 Rose-campion, bluebell, kingcup, poppy, glanced
 About the revels, and with mirth so loud
 Beyond all use, that, half-amazed, the Queen,
 And wroth at Tristram and the lawless jousts,
 Brake up their sports, then slowly to her bower
 Parted, and in her bosom pain was lord.

        *       *       *       *       *

   And little Dagonet on the morrow morn,
 High over all the yellowing Autumn-tide,
 Danced like a wither'd leaf before the hall.
 Then Tristram saying, "Why skip ye so, Sir Fool?"
 Wheel'd round on either heel, Dagonet replied,
 "Belike for lack of wiser company;
 Or being fool, and seeing too much wit
 Makes the world rotten, why, belike I skip
 To know myself the wisest knight of all."
 "Ay, fool," said Tristram, "but 'tis eating dry
 To dance without a catch, a roundelay
 To dance to." Then he twangled on his harp,
 And while he twangled little Dagonet stood,
 Quiet as any water-sodden log
 Stay'd in the wandering warble of a brook;
 But when the twangling ended, skipt again;
 Then being ask'd, "Why skipt ye not, Sir Fool?"
 Made answer, "I had liefer twenty years
 Skip to the broken music of my brains
 Than any broken music ye can make."
 Then Tristram, waiting for the quip to come,
 "Good now, what music have I broken, fool?"
 And little Dagonet, skipping, "Arthur, the king's;
 For when thou playest that air with Queen Isolt,
 Thou makest broken music with thy bride,
 Her daintier namesake down in Brittany--
 And so thou breakest Arthur's music too."
 "Save for that broken music in thy brains,
 Sir Fool," said Tristram, "I would break thy head.
 Fool, I came late, the heathen wars were o'er,
 The life had flown, we sware but by the shell--
 I am but a fool to reason with a fool
 Come, thou art crabb'd and sour: but lean me down,
 Sir Dagonet, one of thy long asses' ears,
 And hearken if my music be not true.

   "'Free love--free field--we love but while we may:
 The woods are hush'd, their music is no more:
 The leaf is dead, the yearning past away:
 New leaf, new life--the days of frost are o'er:
 New life, new love to suit the newer day:
 New loves are sweet as those that went before:
 Free love,--free field--we love but while we may.'

   "Ye might have moved slow-measure to my tune,
 Not stood stockstill. I made it in the woods,
 And found it ring as true as tested gold."

   But Dagonet with one foot poised in his hand,
 "Friend, did ye mark that fountain yesterday
 Made to run wine?--but this had run itself
 All out like a long life to a sour end--
 And them that round it sat with golden cups
 To hand the wine to whomsoever came--
 The twelve small damosels white as Innocence,

   "In honor of poor Innocence the babe,
 Who left the gems which Innocence the Queen
 Lent to the King, and Innocence the King
 Gave for a prize--and one of those white slips
 Handed her cup and piped, the pretty one,
 'Drink, drink, Sir Fool,' and thereupon I drank,
 Spat--pish--the cup was gold, the draught was mud."
 And Tristram, "Was it muddier than thy gibes?
 Is all the laughter gone dead out of thee?--
 Not marking how the knighthood mock thee, fool--
 'Fear God: honor the king--his one true knight--
 Sole follower of the vows'--for here be they
 Who knew thee swine enow before I came,
 Smuttier than blasted grain: but when the King
 Had made thee fool, thy vanity so shot up
 It frighted all free fool from out thy heart;
 Which left thee less than fool, and less than swine,
 A naked aught--yet swine I hold thee still,
 For I have flung thee pearls, and find thee swine."

   And little Dagonet mincing with his feet,
 "Knight, an ye fling those rubies round my neck
 In lieu of hers, I'll hold thou hast some touch
 Of music, since I care not for thy pearls.
 Swine? I have wallow'd, I have wash'd--the world
 Is flesh and shadow--I have had my day.
 The dirty nurse, Experience, in her kind
 Hath foul'd me--an I wallow'd, then I wash'd--
 I have had my day and my philosophies--
 And thank the Lord I am King Arthur's fool.
 Swine, say ye? swine, goats, asses, rams and geese
 Troop'd round a Paynim harper once, who thrumm'd
 On such a wire as musically as thou
 Some such fine song--but never a king's fool."

   And Tristram, "Then were swine, goats, asses, geese
 The wiser fools, seeing thy Paynim bard
 Had such a mastery of his mystery
 That he could harp his wife up out of Hell."

   Then Dagonet, turning on the ball of his foot,
 "And whither harp'st thou thine? down! and thyself
 Down! and two more: a helpful harper thou,
 That harpest downward! Dost thou know the star
 We call the harp of Arthur up in heaven?"

   And Tristram, "Ay, Sir Fool, for when our King
 Was victor wellnigh day by day, the knights,
 Glorying in each new glory, set his name
 High on all hills, and in the signs of heaven."

   And Dagonet answer'd, "Ay, and when the land
 Was freed, and the Queen false, ye set yourself
 To babble about him, all to show your wit--
 And whether he were king by courtesy,
 Or king by right--and so went harping down
 The black king's highway, got so far, and grew
 So witty, that ye play'd at ducks and drakes
 With Arthur's vows on the great lake of fire.
 Tuwhoo! do ye see it? do ye see the star?"
 "Nay, fool," said Tristram, "not in open day."
 And Dagonet, "Nay, nor will: I see it and hear.
 It makes a silent music up in heaven,
 And I, and Arthur and the angels hear,
 And then we skip." "Lo, fool," he said, "ye talk
 Fool's treason: is the king thy brother fool?"
 Then little Dagonet clapt his hands and shrill'd,
 "Ay, ay, my brother fool, the king of fools*!
 Conceits himself as God that he can make
 Figs out of thistles, silk from bristles, milk
 From burning spurge, honey from hornet-combs,
 And men from beasts.--Long live the king of fools!"

   And down the city Dagonet danced away.
 But thro' the slowly-mellowing avenues
 And solitary passes of the wood
 Rode Tristram toward Lyonesse and the west.
 Before him fled the face of Queen Isolt
 With ruby-circled neck, but evermore
 Past, as a rustle or twitter in the wood
 Made dull his inner, keen his outer eye
 For all that walk'd, or crept, or perched, or flew.
 Anon the face, as, when a gust hath blown,
 Unruffling waters re-collect the shape
 Of one that in them sees himself, return'd;
 But at the slot or fewmets of a deer,
 Or ev'n a fall'n feather, vanish'd again.

   So on for all that day from lawn to lawn
 Thro' many a league-long bower he rode. At length
 A lodge of intertwisted beechen-boughs
 Furze-cramm'd, and bracken-rooft, the which himself
 Built for a summer day with Queen Isolt
 Against a shower, dark in the golden grove
 Appearing, sent his fancy back to where
 She lived a moon in that low lodge with him:
 Till Mark her lord had past, the Cornish king,
 With six or seven, when Tristram was away,
 And snatch'd her thence; yet dreading worse than shame
 Her warrior Tristram, spake not any word,
 But bode his hour, devising wretchedness.

   And now that desert lodge to Tristram lookt
 So sweet, that, halting, in he past, and sank
 Down on a drift of foliage random-blown;
 But could not rest for musing how to smooth
 And sleek his marriage over to the Queen.
 Perchance in lone Tintagil far from all
 The tonguesters of the court she had not heard.
 But then what folly had sent him overseas
 After she left him lonely here? a name?
 Was it the name of one in Brittany,
 Isolt, the daughter of the King? "Isolt
 Of the white hands" they call'd her: the sweet name
 Allured him first, and then the maid herself,
 Who served him well with those white hands of hers,
 And loved him well, until himself had thought
 He loved her also, wedded easily,
 But left her all as easily, and return'd.
 The black-blue Irish hair and Irish eyes
 Had drawn him home--what marvel? then he laid
 His brows upon the drifted leaf and dream'd.

   He seem'd to pace the strand of Brittany
 Between Isolt of Britain and his bride,
 And show'd them both the ruby-chain, and both
 Began to struggle for it, till his Queen
 Graspt it so hard, that all her hand was red.
 Then cried the Breton, "Look, her hand is red!
 These be no rubies, this is frozen blood,
 And melts within her hand--her hand is hot
 With ill desires, but this I gave thee, look,
 Is all as cool and white as any flower."
 Follow'd a rush of eagle's wings, and then
 A whimpering of the spirit of the child,
 Because the twain had spoil'd her carcanet.

   He dream'd; but Arthur with a hundred spears
 Rode far, till o'er the illimitable reed,
 And many a glancing plash and sallowy isle,
 The wide-wing'd sunset of the misty marsh
 Glared on a huge machicolated tower
 That stood with open doors, whereout was roll'd
 A roar of riot, as from men secure
 Amid their marshes, ruffians at their ease
 Among their harlot-brides, an evil song.
 "Lo there," said one of Arthur's youth, for there,
 High on a grim dead tree before the tower,
 A goodly brother of The Table Round
 Swung by the neck: and on the boughs a shield
 Showing a shower of blood in a field noir,
 And therebeside a horn, inflamed the knights
 At that dishonor done the gilded spur,
 Till each would clash the shield, and blow the horn.
 But Arthur waved them back: alone he rode.
 Then at the dry harsh roar of the great horn,
 That sent the face of all the marsh aloft

   An ever upward-rushing storm and cloud
 Of shriek and plume, the Red Knight heard, and all,
 Even to tipmost lance and topmost helm,
 In blood-red armor sallying, howl'd to the King,
 "The teeth of Hell flay bare and gnash thee flat!--
 Lo! art thou not that eunuch-hearted King
 Who fain had clipt free manhood from the world--
 The woman-worshipper? Yea, God's curse, and I!
 Slain was the brother of my paramour
 By a knight of thine, and I that heard her whine
 And snivel, being eunuch-hearted too,
 Sware by the scorpion-worm that twists in hell,
 And stings itself to everlasting death,
 To hang whatever knight of thine I fought
 And tumbled. Art thou King?--Look to thy life!"
 He ended: Arthur knew the voice; the face
 Wellnigh was helmet-hidden, and the name
 Went wandering somewhere darkling in his mind.
 And Arthur deign'd not use of word or sword,
 But let the drunkard, as he stretch'd from horse
 To strike him, overbalancing his bulk,
 Down from the causeway heavily to the swamp
 Fall, as the crest of some slow-arching wave
 Heard in dead night along that table-shore
 Drops flat, and after the great waters break
 Whitening for half a league, and thin themselves
 Far over sands marbled with moon and cloud.
 From less and less to nothing; thus he fell
 Head-heavy, while the knights, who watch'd him, roar'd
 And shouted and leapt down upon the fall'n;
 There trampled out his face from being known,
 And sank his head in mire, and slimed themselves:
 Nor heard the King for their own cries, but sprang
 Thro' open doors, and swording right and left
 Men, women, on their sodden faces, hurl'd
 The tables over and the wines, and slew
 Till all the rafters rang with woman-yells,
 And all the pavement stream'd with massacre:
 Then, yell with yell echoing, they fired the tower,
 Which half that autumn night, like the live North,
 Red-pulsing up thro' Alioth and Alcor,
 Made all above it, and a hundred meres
 About it, as the water Moab saw
 Come round by the East, and out beyond them flush'd
 The long low dune, and lazy-plunging sea.

   So all the ways were safe from shore to shore,
 But in the heart of Arthur pain was lord.
 Then out of Tristram waking the red dream
 Fled with a shout, and that low lodge return'd,
 Mid-forest, and the wind among the boughs.
 He whistled his good warhorse left to graze
 Among the forest greens, vaulted upon him,
 And rode beneath an ever-showering leaf,
 Till one lone woman, weeping near a cross,
 Stay'd him, "Why weep ye?" "Lord," she said, "my man
 Hath left me or is dead;" whereon he thought--
 "What an she hate me now? I would not this.
 What an she love me still? I would not that.
 I know not what I would"--but said to her,--
 "Yet weep not thou, lest, if thy mate return,
 He find thy favor changed and love thee not"--
 Then pressing day by day thro' Lyonesse
 Last in a roky hollow, belling, heard
 The hounds of Mark, and felt the goodly hounds
 Yelp at his heart, but, turning, past and gain'd
 Tintagil, half in sea, and high on land,
 A crown of towers.

   Down in a casement sat,
 A low sea-sunset glorying round her hair
 And glossy-throated grace, Isolt the Queen.
 And when she heard the feet of Tristram grind
 The spiring stone that scaled about her tower,
 Flush'd, started, met him at the doors, and there
 Belted his body with her white embrace,
 Crying aloud, "Not Mark--not Mark, my soul!
 The footstep flutter'd me at first: not he:
 Catlike thro' his own castle steals my Mark,
 But warrior-wise thou stridest through his halls
 Who hates thee, as I him--ev'n to the death.
 My soul, I felt my hatred for my Mark
 Quicken within me, and knew that thou wert nigh."
 To whom Sir Tristram smiling, "I am here.
 Let be thy Mark, seeing he is not thine."

   And drawing somewhat backward she replied,
 "Can he be wrong'd who is not ev'n his own,
 But save for dread of thee had beaten me,
 Scratch'd, bitten, blinded, marr'd me somehow--Mark?
 What rights are his that dare not strike for them?
 Not lift a hand--not, tho' he found me thus!
 But hearken, have ye met him? hence he went
 To-day for three days' hunting--as he said--
 And so returns belike within an hour.
 Mark's way, my soul!--but eat not thou with him,
 Because he hates thee even more than fears;
 Nor drink: and when thou passest any wood
 Close visor, lest an arrow from the bush
 Should leave me all alone with Mark and hell.
 My God, the measure of my hate for Mark
 Is as the measure of my love for thee."

   So, pluck'd one way by hate and one by love,
 Drain'd of her force, again she sat, and spake
 To Tristram, as he knelt before her, saying,
 "O hunter, and O blower of the horn,
 Harper, and thou hast been a rover too,
 For, ere I mated with my shambling king,
 Ye twain had fallen out about the bride
 Of one--his name is out of me--the prize,
 If prize she were--(what marvel--she could see)--
 Thine, friend; and ever since my craven seeks
 To wreck thee villanously: but, O Sir Knight,
 What dame or damsel have ye kneeled to last?"

   And Tristram, "Last to my Queen Paramount,
 Here now to my Queen Paramount of love,
 And loveliness, ay, lovelier than when first
 Her light feet fell on our rough Lyonesse,
 Sailing from Ireland."

   Softly laugh'd Isolt,
 "Flatter me not, for hath not our great Queen
 My dole of beauty trebled?" and he said,
 "Her beauty is her beauty, and thine thine,
 And thine is more to me--soft, gracious, kind--
 Save when thy Mark is kindled on thy lips
 Most gracious; but she, haughty, ev'n to him,
 Lancelot; for I have seen him wan enow
 To make one doubt if ever the great Queen
 Have yielded him her love."

   To whom Isolt,
 "Ah then, false hunter and false harper, thou
 Who brakest thro' the scruple of my bond,
 Calling me thy white hind, and saying to me
 That Guinevere had sinned against the highest,
 And I--misyoked with such a want of man--
 That I could hardly sin against the lowest."

   He answer'd, "O my soul, be comforted!
 If this be sweet, to sin in leading-strings,
 If here be comfort, and if ours be sin,
 Crown'd warrant had we for the crowning sin
 That made us happy: but how ye greet me--fear
 And fault and doubt--no word of that fond tale--
 Thy deep heart-yearnings, thy sweet memories
 Of Tristram in that year he was away."

   And, saddening on the sudden, spake Isolt,
 "I had forgotten all in my strong joy
 To see thee--yearnings?--ay! for, hour by hour,
 Here in the never-ended afternoon,
 O sweeter than all memories of thee,
 Deeper than any yearnings after thee
 Seem'd those far-rolling, westward-smiling seas,
 Watched from this tower. Isolt of Britain dash'd
 Before Isolt of Brittany on the strand,
 Would that have chill'd her bride-kiss? Wedded her?
 Fought in her father's battles? wounded there?
 The King was all fulfill'd with gratefulness,
 And she, my namesake of the hands, that heal'd
 Thy hurt and heart with unguent and caress--
 Well--can I wish her any huger wrong
 Than having known thee? her too hast thou left
 To pine and waste in those sweet memories?
 O were I not my Mark's, by whom all men
 Are noble, I should hate thee more than love."

   And Tristram, fondling her light hands, replied,
 "Grace, Queen, for being loved: she loved me well.
 Did I love her? the name at least I loved.
 Isolt?--I fought his battles, for Isolt!
 The night was dark; the true star set. Isolt!
 The name was ruler of the dark----Isolt?
 Care not for her! patient, and prayerful, meek,
 Pale-blooded, she will yield herself to God."
 And Isolt answer'd, "Yea, and why not I?
 Mine is the larger need, who am not meek,
 Pale-blooded, prayerful. Let me tell thee now.
 Here one black, mute midsummer night I sat
 Lonely, but musing on thee, wondering where,
 Murmuring a light song I had heard thee sing,
 And once or twice I spake thy name aloud.
 Then flash'd a levin-brand; and near me stood,
 In fuming sulphur blue and green, a fiend--
 Mark's way to steal behind one in the dark--
 For there was Mark: 'He has wedded her,' he said,
 Not said, but hiss'd it: then this crown of towers
 So shook to such a roar of all the sky,
 That here in utter dark I swoon'd away,
 And woke again in utter dark, and cried,
 'I will flee hence and give myself to God'--
 And thou wert lying in thy new leman's arms."

   Then Tristram, ever dallying with her hand,
 "May God be with thee, sweet, when old and gray,
 And past desire!" a saying that anger'd her.
 "'May God be with thee, sweet, when thou art old,
 And sweet no more to me!' I need Him now.
 For when had Lancelot utter'd aught so gross
 Ev'n to the swineherd's malkin in the mast?
 The greater man, the greater courtesy.
 But thou, thro' ever harrying thy wild beasts--
 Save that to touch a harp, tilt with a lance
 Becomes thee well--art grown wild beast thyself.
 How darest thou, if lover, push me even
 In fancy from thy side, and set me far
 In the gray distance, half a life away,
 Her to be loved no more? Unsay it, unswear!
 Flatter me rather, seeing me so weak,
 Broken with Mark and hate and solitude,
 Thy marriage and mine own, that I should suck
 Lies like sweet wines: lie to me: I believe.
 Will ye not lie? not swear, as there ye kneel,
 And solemnly as when ye sware to him,
 The man of men, our King--My God, the power
 Was once in vows when men believed the King!
 They lied not then, who sware, and thro' their vows
 The King prevailing made his realm:--I say,
 Swear to me thou wilt love me ev'n when old,
 Gray-haired, and past desire, and in despair."

   Then Tristram, pacing moodily up and down,
 "Vows! did ye keep the vow ye made to Mark
 More than I mine? Lied, say ye? Nay, but learnt,
 The vow that binds too strictly snaps itself--
 My knighthood taught me this--ay, being snapt--
 We run more counter to the soul thereof
 Than had we never sworn. I swear no more.
 I swore to the great King, and am forsworn.
 For once--ev'n to the height--I honor'd him.
 'Man, is he man at all?' methought, when first
 I rode from our rough Lyonesse, and beheld
 That victor of the Pagan throned in hall--
 His hair, a sun that ray'd from off a brow
 Like hillsnow high in heaven, the steel-blue eyes,
 The golden beard that clothed his lips with light--
 Moreover, that weird legend of his birth,
 With Merlin's mystic babble about his end,
 Amazed me; then, his foot was on a stool
 Shaped as a dragon; he seem'd to me no man,
 But Michael trampling Satan; so I sware,
 Being amazed: but this went by--the vows!
 O ay--the wholesome madness of an hour--
 They served their use, their time; for every knight
 Believed himself a greater than himself,
 And every follower eyed him as a God;
 Till he, being lifted up beyond himself,
 Did mightier deeds than elsewise he had done,
 And so the realm was made; but then their vows--
 First mainly thro' that sullying of our Queen--
 Began to gall the knighthood, asking whence
 Had Arthur right to bind them to himself?
 Dropt down from heaven? wash'd up from out the deep?
 They fail'd to trace him thro' the flesh and blood
 Of our old Kings: whence then? a doubtful lord
 To bind them by inviolable vows,
 Which flesh and blood perforce would violate:
 For feel this arm of mine--the tide within
 Red with free chase and heather-scented air,
 Pulsing full man; can Arthur make me pure
 As any maiden child? lock up my tongue
 From uttering freely what I freely hear?
 Bind me to one? The great world laughs at it.
 And worldling of the world am I, and know
 The ptarmigan that whitens ere his hour
 Wooes his own end; we are not angels here
 Nor shall be: vows--I am woodman of the woods,
 And hear the garnet-headed yaffingale
 Mock them: my soul, we love but while we may;
 And therefore is my love so large for thee,
 Seeing it is not bounded save by love."

   Here ending, he moved toward her, and she said,
 "Good: an I turn'd away my love for thee
 To some one thrice as courteous as thyself--
 For courtesy wins woman all as well
 As valor may--but he that closes both
 Is perfect, he is Lancelot--taller indeed,
 Rosier, and comelier, thou--but say I loved
 This knightliest of all knights, and cast thee back
 Thine own small saw 'We love but while we may,'
 Well then, what answer?"

   He that while she spake,
 Mindful of what he brought to adorn her with,
 The jewels, had let one finger lightly touch
 The warm white apple of her throat, replied,
 "Press this a little closer, sweet, until--
 Come, I am hunger'd and half-anger'd--meat,
 Wine, wine--and I will love thee to the death,
 And out beyond into the dream to come."

   So then, when both were brought to full accord,
 She rose, and set before him all he will'd;
 And after these had comforted the blood
 With meats and wines, and satiated their hearts--
 Now talking of their woodland paradise,
 The deer, the dews, the fern, the founts, the lawns;
 Now mocking at the much ungainliness,
 And craven shifts, and long crane legs of Mark--
 Then Tristram laughing caught the harp, and sang:

   "Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that bend the brier!
 A star in heaven, a star within the mere!
 Ay, ay, O ay--a star was my desire,
 And one was far apart, and one was near:
 Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that bow the grass!
 And one was water and one star was fire,
 And one will ever shine and one will pass.
 Ay, ay, O ay--the winds that move the mere."

   Then in the light's last glimmer Tristram show'd
 And swung the ruby carcanet. She cried,
 "The collar of some order, which our King
 Hath newly founded, all for thee, my soul,
 For thee, to yield thee grace beyond thy peers."
 "Not so, my Queen," he said, "but the red fruit
 Grown on a magic oak-tree in mid-heaven,
 And won by Tristram as a tourney-prize,
 And hither brought by Tristram for his last
 Love-offering and peace-offering unto thee."

   He rose, he turn'd, and flinging round her neck,
 Claspt it; but while he bow'd himself to lay
 Warm kisses in the hollow of her throat,
 Out of the dark, just as the lips had touch'd,
 Behind him rose a shadow and a shriek--
 "Mark's way," said Mark, and clove him thro' the brain.

   That night came Arthur home, and while he climb'd,
 All in a death-dumb autumn-dripping gloom,
 The stairway to the hall, and look'd and saw
 The great Queen's bower was dark,--about his feet
 A voice clung sobbing till he question'd it,
 "What art thou?" and the voice about his feet
 Sent up an answer, sobbing, "I am thy fool,
 And I shall never make thee smile again."

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit:  www.gutenberg.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For forty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

THE PRINCESS

by Alfred Lord Tennyson




PROLOGUE


   Sir Walter Vivian all a summer's day
   Gave his broad lawns until the set of sun
   Up to the people:  thither flocked at noon
   His tenants, wife and child, and thither half
   The neighbouring borough with their Institute
   Of which he was the patron.  I was there
   From college, visiting the son,--the son
   A Walter too,--with others of our set,
   Five others:  we were seven at Vivian-place.

        And me that morning Walter showed the house,
   Greek, set with busts:  from vases in the hall
   Flowers of all heavens, and lovelier than their names,
   Grew side by side; and on the pavement lay
   Carved stones of the Abbey-ruin in the park,
   Huge Ammonites, and the first bones of Time;
   And on the tables every clime and age
   Jumbled together; celts and calumets,
   Claymore and snowshoe, toys in lava, fans
   Of sandal, amber, ancient rosaries,
   Laborious orient ivory sphere in sphere,
   The cursed Malayan crease, and battle-clubs
   From the isles of palm:  and higher on the walls,
   Betwixt the monstrous horns of elk and deer,
   His own forefathers' arms and armour hung.

        And 'this' he said 'was Hugh's at Agincourt;
   And that was old Sir Ralph's at Ascalon:
   A good knight he! we keep a chronicle
   With all about him'--which he brought, and I
   Dived in a hoard of tales that dealt with knights,
   Half-legend, half-historic, counts and kings
   Who laid about them at their wills and died;
   And mixt with these, a lady, one that armed
   Her own fair head, and sallying through the gate,
   Had beat her foes with slaughter from her walls.

        'O miracle of women,' said the book,
   'O noble heart who, being strait-besieged
   By this wild king to force her to his wish,
   Nor bent, nor broke, nor shunned a soldier's death,
   But now when all was lost or seemed as lost--
   Her stature more than mortal in the burst
   Of sunrise, her arm lifted, eyes on fire--
   Brake with a blast of trumpets from the gate,
   And, falling on them like a thunderbolt,
   She trampled some beneath her horses' heels,
   And some were whelmed with missiles of the wall,
   And some were pushed with lances from the rock,
   And part were drowned within the whirling brook:
   O miracle of noble womanhood!'

        So sang the gallant glorious chronicle;
   And, I all rapt in this, 'Come out,' he said,
   'To the Abbey: there is Aunt Elizabeth
   And sister Lilia with the rest.'  We went
   (I kept the book and had my finger in it)
   Down through the park:  strange was the sight to me;
   For all the sloping pasture murmured, sown
   With happy faces and with holiday.
   There moved the multitude, a thousand heads:
   The patient leaders of their Institute
   Taught them with facts.  One reared a font of stone
   And drew, from butts of water on the slope,
   The fountain of the moment, playing, now
   A twisted snake, and now a rain of pearls,
   Or steep-up spout whereon the gilded ball
   Danced like a wisp:  and somewhat lower down
   A man with knobs and wires and vials fired
   A cannon:  Echo answered in her sleep
   From hollow fields:  and here were telescopes
   For azure views; and there a group of girls
   In circle waited, whom the electric shock
   Dislinked with shrieks and laughter:  round the lake
   A little clock-work steamer paddling plied
   And shook the lilies:  perched about the knolls
   A dozen angry models jetted steam:
   A petty railway ran:  a fire-balloon
   Rose gem-like up before the dusky groves
   And dropt a fairy parachute and past:
   And there through twenty posts of telegraph
   They flashed a saucy message to and fro
   Between the mimic stations; so that sport
   Went hand in hand with Science; otherwhere
   Pure sport; a herd of boys with clamour bowled
   And stumped the wicket; babies rolled about
   Like tumbled fruit in grass; and men and maids
   Arranged a country dance, and flew through light
   And shadow, while the twangling violin
   Struck up with Soldier-laddie, and overhead
   The broad ambrosial aisles of lofty lime
   Made noise with bees and breeze from end to end.

        Strange was the sight and smacking of the time;
   And long we gazed, but satiated at length
   Came to the ruins.  High-arched and ivy-claspt,
   Of finest Gothic lighter than a fire,
   Through one wide chasm of time and frost they gave
   The park, the crowd, the house; but all within
   The sward was trim as any garden lawn:
   And here we lit on Aunt Elizabeth,
   And Lilia with the rest, and lady friends
   From neighbour seats:  and there was Ralph himself,
   A broken statue propt against the wall,
   As gay as any.  Lilia, wild with sport,
   Half child half woman as she was, had wound
   A scarf of orange round the stony helm,
   And robed the shoulders in a rosy silk,
   That made the old warrior from his ivied nook
   Glow like a sunbeam:  near his tomb a feast
   Shone, silver-set; about it lay the guests,
   And there we joined them:  then the maiden Aunt
   Took this fair day for text, and from it preached
   An universal culture for the crowd,
   And all things great; but we, unworthier, told
   Of college:  he had climbed across the spikes,
   And he had squeezed himself betwixt the bars,
   And he had breathed the Proctor's dogs; and one
   Discussed his tutor, rough to common men,
   But honeying at the whisper of a lord;
   And one the Master, as a rogue in grain
   Veneered with sanctimonious theory.
        But while they talked, above their heads I saw
   The feudal warrior lady-clad; which brought
   My book to mind:  and opening this I read
   Of old Sir Ralph a page or two that rang
   With tilt and tourney; then the tale of her
   That drove her foes with slaughter from her walls,
   And much I praised her nobleness, and 'Where,'
   Asked Walter, patting Lilia's head (she lay
   Beside him) 'lives there such a woman now?'

        Quick answered Lilia 'There are thousands now
   Such women, but convention beats them down:
   It is but bringing up; no more than that:
   You men have done it:  how I hate you all!
   Ah, were I something great!  I wish I were
   Some might poetess, I would shame you then,
   That love to keep us children!  O I wish
   That I were some great princess, I would build
   Far off from men a college like a man's,
   And I would teach them all that men are taught;
   We are twice as quick!'  And here she shook aside
   The hand that played the patron with her curls.

        And one said smiling 'Pretty were the sight
   If our old halls could change their sex, and flaunt
   With prudes for proctors, dowagers for deans,
   And sweet girl-graduates in their golden hair.
   I think they should not wear our rusty gowns,
   But move as rich as Emperor-moths, or Ralph
   Who shines so in the corner; yet I fear,
   If there were many Lilias in the brood,
   However deep you might embower the nest,
   Some boy would spy it.'
                          At this upon the sward
   She tapt her tiny silken-sandaled foot:
   'That's your light way; but I would make it death
   For any male thing but to peep at us.'

        Petulant she spoke, and at herself she laughed;
   A rosebud set with little wilful thorns,
   And sweet as English air could make her, she:
   But Walter hailed a score of names upon her,
   And 'petty Ogress', and 'ungrateful Puss',
   And swore he longed at college, only longed,
   All else was well, for she-society.
   They boated and they cricketed; they talked
   At wine, in clubs, of art, of politics;
   They lost their weeks; they vext the souls of deans;
   They rode; they betted; made a hundred friends,
   And caught the blossom of the flying terms,
   But missed the mignonette of Vivian-place,
   The little hearth-flower Lilia.  Thus he spoke,
   Part banter, part affection.
                               'True,' she said,
   'We doubt not that.  O yes, you missed us much.
   I'll stake my ruby ring upon it you did.'

        She held it out; and as a parrot turns
   Up through gilt wires a crafty loving eye,
   And takes a lady's finger with all care,
   And bites it for true heart and not for harm,
   So he with Lilia's.  Daintily she shrieked
   And wrung it.  'Doubt my word again!' he said.
   'Come, listen! here is proof that you were missed:
   We seven stayed at Christmas up to read;
   And there we took one tutor as to read:
   The hard-grained Muses of the cube and square
   Were out of season:  never man, I think,
   So mouldered in a sinecure as he:
   For while our cloisters echoed frosty feet,
   And our long walks were stript as bare as brooms,
   We did but talk you over, pledge you all
   In wassail; often, like as many girls--
   Sick for the hollies and the yews of home--
   As many little trifling Lilias--played
   Charades and riddles as at Christmas here,
   And _what's my thought_ and _when_ and _where_ and _how_,
   As here at Christmas.'
                         She remembered that:
   A pleasant game, she thought:  she liked it more
   Than magic music, forfeits, all the rest.
   But these--what kind of tales did men tell men,
   She wondered, by themselves?
                               A half-disdain
   Perched on the pouted blossom of her lips:
   And Walter nodded at me; '_He_ began,
   The rest would follow, each in turn; and so
   We forged a sevenfold story.  Kind? what kind?
   Chimeras, crotchets, Christmas solecisms,
   Seven-headed monsters only made to kill
   Time by the fire in winter.'
                               'Kill him now,
   The tyrant! kill him in the summer too,'
   Said Lilia; 'Why not now?' the maiden Aunt.
   'Why not a summer's as a winter's tale?
   A tale for summer as befits the time,
   And something it should be to suit the place,
   Heroic, for a hero lies beneath,
   Grave, solemn!'
                  Walter warped his mouth at this
   To something so mock-solemn, that I laughed
   And Lilia woke with sudden-thrilling mirth
   An echo like a ghostly woodpecker,
   Hid in the ruins; till the maiden Aunt
   (A little sense of wrong had touched her face
   With colour) turned to me with 'As you will;
   Heroic if you will, or what you will,
   Or be yourself you hero if you will.'

        'Take Lilia, then, for heroine' clamoured he,
   'And make her some great Princess, six feet high,
   Grand, epic, homicidal; and be you
   The Prince to win her!'
                          'Then follow me, the Prince,'
   I answered, 'each be hero in his turn!
   Seven and yet one, like shadows in a dream.--
   Heroic seems our Princess as required--
   But something made to suit with Time and place,
   A Gothic ruin and a Grecian house,
   A talk of college and of ladies' rights,
   A feudal knight in silken masquerade,
   And, yonder, shrieks and strange experiments
   For which the good Sir Ralph had burnt them all--
   This _were_ a medley! we should have him back
   Who told the "Winter's tale" to do it for us.
   No matter:  we will say whatever comes.
   And let the ladies sing us, if they will,
   From time to time, some ballad or a song
   To give us breathing-space.'
                               So I began,
   And the rest followed:  and the women sang
   Between the rougher voices of the men,
   Like linnets in the pauses of the wind:
   And here I give the story and the songs.




I



   A prince I was, blue-eyed, and fair in face,
   Of temper amorous, as the first of May,
   With lengths of yellow ringlet, like a girl,
   For on my cradle shone the Northern star.

        There lived an ancient legend in our house.
   Some sorcerer, whom a far-off grandsire burnt
   Because he cast no shadow, had foretold,
   Dying, that none of all our blood should know
   The shadow from the substance, and that one
   Should come to fight with shadows and to fall.
   For so, my mother said, the story ran.
   And, truly, waking dreams were, more or less,
   An old and strange affection of the house.
   Myself too had weird seizures, Heaven knows what:
   On a sudden in the midst of men and day,
   And while I walked and talked as heretofore,
   I seemed to move among a world of ghosts,
   And feel myself the shadow of a dream.
   Our great court-Galen poised his gilt-head cane,
   And pawed his beard, and muttered 'catalepsy'.
   My mother pitying made a thousand prayers;
   My mother was as mild as any saint,
   Half-canonized by all that looked on her,
   So gracious was her tact and tenderness:
   But my good father thought a king a king;
   He cared not for the affection of the house;
   He held his sceptre like a pedant's wand
   To lash offence, and with long arms and hands
   Reached out, and picked offenders from the mass
   For judgment.
                Now it chanced that I had been,
   While life was yet in bud and blade, bethrothed
   To one, a neighbouring Princess:  she to me
   Was proxy-wedded with a bootless calf
   At eight years old; and still from time to time
   Came murmurs of her beauty from the South,
   And of her brethren, youths of puissance;
   And still I wore her picture by my heart,
   And one dark tress; and all around them both
   Sweet thoughts would swarm as bees about their queen.

        But when the days drew nigh that I should wed,
   My father sent ambassadors with furs
   And jewels, gifts, to fetch her:  these brought back
   A present, a great labour of the loom;
   And therewithal an answer vague as wind:
   Besides, they saw the king; he took the gifts;
   He said there was a compact; that was true:
   But then she had a will; was he to blame?
   And maiden fancies; loved to live alone
   Among her women; certain, would not wed.

        That morning in the presence room I stood
   With Cyril and with Florian, my two friends:
   The first, a gentleman of broken means
   (His father's fault) but given to starts and bursts
   Of revel; and the last, my other heart,
   And almost my half-self, for still we moved
   Together, twinned as horse's ear and eye.

        Now, while they spake, I saw my father's face
   Grow long and troubled like a rising moon,
   Inflamed with wrath:  he started on his feet,
   Tore the king's letter, snowed it down, and rent
   The wonder of the loom through warp and woof
   From skirt to skirt; and at the last he sware
   That he would send a hundred thousand men,
   And bring her in a whirlwind:  then he chewed
   The thrice-turned cud of wrath, and cooked his spleen,
   Communing with his captains of the war.

        At last I spoke.  'My father, let me go.
   It cannot be but some gross error lies
   In this report, this answer of a king,
   Whom all men rate as kind and hospitable:
   Or, maybe, I myself, my bride once seen,
   Whate'er my grief to find her less than fame,
   May rue the bargain made.'  And Florian said:
   'I have a sister at the foreign court,
   Who moves about the Princess; she, you know,
   Who wedded with a nobleman from thence:
   He, dying lately, left her, as I hear,
   The lady of three castles in that land:
   Through her this matter might be sifted clean.'
   And Cyril whispered:  'Take me with you too.'
   Then laughing 'what, if these weird seizures come
   Upon you in those lands, and no one near
   To point you out the shadow from the truth!
   Take me:  I'll serve you better in a strait;
   I grate on rusty hinges here:'  but 'No!'
   Roared the rough king, 'you shall not; we ourself
   Will crush her pretty maiden fancies dead
   In iron gauntlets:  break the council up.'

        But when the council broke, I rose and past
   Through the wild woods that hung about the town;
   Found a still place, and plucked her likeness out;
   Laid it on flowers, and watched it lying bathed
   In the green gleam of dewy-tasselled trees:
   What were those fancies? wherefore break her troth?
   Proud looked the lips:  but while I meditated
   A wind arose and rushed upon the South,
   And shook the songs, the whispers, and the shrieks
   Of the wild woods together; and a Voice
   Went with it, 'Follow, follow, thou shalt win.'

        Then, ere the silver sickle of that month
   Became her golden shield, I stole from court
   With Cyril and with Florian, unperceived,
   Cat-footed through the town and half in dread
   To hear my father's clamour at our backs
   With Ho! from some bay-window shake the night;
   But all was quiet:  from the bastioned walls
   Like threaded spiders, one by one, we dropt,
   And flying reached the frontier:  then we crost
   To a livelier land; and so by tilth and grange,
   And vines, and blowing bosks of wilderness,
   We gained the mother city thick with towers,
   And in the imperial palace found the king.

        His name was Gama; cracked and small his voice,
   But bland the smile that like a wrinkling wind
   On glassy water drove his cheek in lines;
   A little dry old man, without a star,
   Not like a king:  three days he feasted us,
   And on the fourth I spake of why we came,
   And my bethrothed.  'You do us, Prince,' he said,
   Airing a snowy hand and signet gem,
   'All honour.  We remember love ourselves
   In our sweet youth:  there did a compact pass
   Long summers back, a kind of ceremony--
   I think the year in which our olives failed.
   I would you had her, Prince, with all my heart,
   With my full heart:  but there were widows here,
   Two widows, Lady Psyche, Lady Blanche;
   They fed her theories, in and out of place
   Maintaining that with equal husbandry
   The woman were an equal to the man.
   They harped on this; with this our banquets rang;
   Our dances broke and buzzed in knots of talk;
   Nothing but this; my very ears were hot
   To hear them:  knowledge, so my daughter held,
   Was all in all:  they had but been, she thought,
   As children; they must lose the child, assume
   The woman:  then, Sir, awful odes she wrote,
   Too awful, sure, for what they treated of,
   But all she is and does is awful; odes
   About this losing of the child; and rhymes
   And dismal lyrics, prophesying change
   Beyond all reason:  these the women sang;
   And they that know such things--I sought but peace;
   No critic I--would call them masterpieces:
   They mastered _me_.  At last she begged a boon,
   A certain summer-palace which I have
   Hard by your father's frontier:  I said no,
   Yet being an easy man, gave it:  and there,
   All wild to found an University
   For maidens, on the spur she fled; and more
   We know not,--only this:  they see no men,
   Not even her brother Arac, nor the twins
   Her brethren, though they love her, look upon her
   As on a kind of paragon; and I
   (Pardon me saying it) were much loth to breed
   Dispute betwixt myself and mine:  but since
   (And I confess with right) you think me bound
   In some sort, I can give you letters to her;
   And yet, to speak the truth, I rate your chance
   Almost at naked nothing.'
                            Thus the king;
   And I, though nettled that he seemed to slur
   With garrulous ease and oily courtesies
   Our formal compact, yet, not less (all frets
   But chafing me on fire to find my bride)
   Went forth again with both my friends.  We rode
   Many a long league back to the North.  At last
   From hills, that looked across a land of hope,
   We dropt with evening on a rustic town
   Set in a gleaming river's crescent-curve,
   Close at the boundary of the liberties;
   There, entered an old hostel, called mine host
   To council, plied him with his richest wines,
   And showed the late-writ letters of the king.

        He with a long low sibilation, stared
   As blank as death in marble; then exclaimed
   Averring it was clear against all rules
   For any man to go:  but as his brain
   Began to mellow, 'If the king,' he said,
   'Had given us letters, was he bound to speak?
   The king would bear him out;' and at the last--
   The summer of the vine in all his veins--
   'No doubt that we might make it worth his while.
   She once had past that way; he heard her speak;
   She scared him; life! he never saw the like;
   She looked as grand as doomsday and as grave:
   And he, he reverenced his liege-lady there;
   He always made a point to post with mares;
   His daughter and his housemaid were the boys:
   The land, he understood, for miles about
   Was tilled by women; all the swine were sows,
   And all the dogs'--
                      But while he jested thus,
   A thought flashed through me which I clothed in act,
   Remembering how we three presented Maid
   Or Nymph, or Goddess, at high tide of feast,
   In masque or pageant at my father's court.
   We sent mine host to purchase female gear;
   He brought it, and himself, a sight to shake
   The midriff of despair with laughter, holp
   To lace us up, till, each, in maiden plumes
   We rustled:  him we gave a costly bribe
   To guerdon silence, mounted our good steeds,
   And boldly ventured on the liberties.

        We followed up the river as we rode,
   And rode till midnight when the college lights
   Began to glitter firefly-like in copse
   And linden alley:  then we past an arch,
   Whereon a woman-statue rose with wings
   From four winged horses dark against the stars;
   And some inscription ran along the front,
   But deep in shadow:  further on we gained
   A little street half garden and half house;
   But scarce could hear each other speak for noise
   Of clocks and chimes, like silver hammers falling
   On silver anvils, and the splash and stir
   Of fountains spouted up and showering down
   In meshes of the jasmine and the rose:
   And all about us pealed the nightingale,
   Rapt in her song, and careless of the snare.

        There stood a bust of Pallas for a sign,
   By two sphere lamps blazoned like Heaven and Earth
   With constellation and with continent,
   Above an entry:  riding in, we called;
   A plump-armed Ostleress and a stable wench
   Came running at the call, and helped us down.
   Then stept a buxom hostess forth, and sailed,
   Full-blown, before us into rooms which gave
   Upon a pillared porch, the bases lost
   In laurel:  her we asked of that and this,
   And who were tutors.  'Lady Blanche' she said,
   'And Lady Psyche.'  'Which was prettiest,
   Best-natured?'  'Lady Psyche.'  'Hers are we,'
   One voice, we cried; and I sat down and wrote,
   In such a hand as when a field of corn
   Bows all its ears before the roaring East;

        'Three ladies of the Northern empire pray
   Your Highness would enroll them with your own,
   As Lady Psyche's pupils.'
                            This I sealed:
   The seal was Cupid bent above a scroll,
   And o'er his head Uranian Venus hung,
   And raised the blinding bandage from his eyes:
   I gave the letter to be sent with dawn;
   And then to bed, where half in doze I seemed
   To float about a glimmering night, and watch
   A full sea glazed with muffled moonlight, swell
   On some dark shore just seen that it was rich.


   As through the land at eve we went,
      And plucked the ripened ears,
   We fell out, my wife and I,
   O we fell out I know not why,
      And kissed again with tears.
   And blessings on the falling out
      That all the more endears,
   When we fall out with those we love
      And kiss again with tears!
   For when we came where lies the child
      We lost in other years,
   There above the little grave,
   O there above the little grave,
      We kissed again with tears.




II



   At break of day the College Portress came:
   She brought us Academic silks, in hue
   The lilac, with a silken hood to each,
   And zoned with gold; and now when these were on,
   And we as rich as moths from dusk cocoons,
   She, curtseying her obeisance, let us know
   The Princess Ida waited:  out we paced,
   I first, and following through the porch that sang
   All round with laurel, issued in a court
   Compact of lucid marbles, bossed with lengths
   Of classic frieze, with ample awnings gay
   Betwixt the pillars, and with great urns of flowers.
   The Muses and the Graces, grouped in threes,
   Enringed a billowing fountain in the midst;
   And here and there on lattice edges lay
   Or book or lute; but hastily we past,
   And up a flight of stairs into the hall.

        There at a board by tome and paper sat,
   With two tame leopards couched beside her throne,
   All beauty compassed in a female form,
   The Princess; liker to the inhabitant
   Of some clear planet close upon the Sun,
   Than our man's earth; such eyes were in her head,
   And so much grace and power, breathing down
   From over her arched brows, with every turn
   Lived through her to the tips of her long hands,
   And to her feet.  She rose her height, and said:

        'We give you welcome:  not without redound
   Of use and glory to yourselves ye come,
   The first-fruits of the stranger:  aftertime,
   And that full voice which circles round the grave,
   Will rank you nobly, mingled up with me.
   What! are the ladies of your land so tall?'
   'We of the court' said Cyril.  'From the court'
   She answered, 'then ye know the Prince?' and he:
   'The climax of his age! as though there were
   One rose in all the world, your Highness that,
   He worships your ideal:'  she replied:
   'We scarcely thought in our own hall to hear
   This barren verbiage, current among men,
   Light coin, the tinsel clink of compliment.
   Your flight from out your bookless wilds would seem
   As arguing love of knowledge and of power;
   Your language proves you still the child.  Indeed,
   We dream not of him:  when we set our hand
   To this great work, we purposed with ourself
   Never to wed.  You likewise will do well,
   Ladies, in entering here, to cast and fling
   The tricks, which make us toys of men, that so,
   Some future time, if so indeed you will,
   You may with those self-styled our lords ally
   Your fortunes, justlier balanced, scale with scale.'

        At those high words, we conscious of ourselves,
   Perused the matting:  then an officer
   Rose up, and read the statutes, such as these:
   Not for three years to correspond with home;
   Not for three years to cross the liberties;
   Not for three years to speak with any men;
   And many more, which hastily subscribed,
   We entered on the boards:  and 'Now,' she cried,
   'Ye are green wood, see ye warp not.  Look, our hall!
   Our statues!--not of those that men desire,
   Sleek Odalisques, or oracles of mode,
   Nor stunted squaws of West or East; but she
   That taught the Sabine how to rule, and she
   The foundress of the Babylonian wall,
   The Carian Artemisia strong in war,
   The Rhodope, that built the pyramid,
   Clelia, Cornelia, with the Palmyrene
   That fought Aurelian, and the Roman brows
   Of Agrippina.  Dwell with these, and lose
   Convention, since to look on noble forms
   Makes noble through the sensuous organism
   That which is higher.  O lift your natures up:
   Embrace our aims:  work out your freedom.  Girls,
   Knowledge is now no more a fountain sealed:
   Drink deep, until the habits of the slave,
   The sins of emptiness, gossip and spite
   And slander, die.  Better not be at all
   Than not be noble.  Leave us:  you may go:
   Today the Lady Psyche will harangue
   The fresh arrivals of the week before;
   For they press in from all the provinces,
   And fill the hive.'
                      She spoke, and bowing waved
   Dismissal:  back again we crost the court
   To Lady Psyche's:  as we entered in,
   There sat along the forms, like morning doves
   That sun their milky bosoms on the thatch,
   A patient range of pupils; she herself
   Erect behind a desk of satin-wood,
   A quick brunette, well-moulded, falcon-eyed,
   And on the hither side, or so she looked,
   Of twenty summers.  At her left, a child,
   In shining draperies, headed like a star,
   Her maiden babe, a double April old,
   Aglaia slept.  We sat:  the Lady glanced:
   Then Florian, but not livelier than the dame
   That whispered 'Asses' ears', among the sedge,
   'My sister.'  'Comely, too, by all that's fair,'
   Said Cyril.  'Oh hush, hush!' and she began.

        'This world was once a fluid haze of light,
   Till toward the centre set the starry tides,
   And eddied into suns, that wheeling cast
   The planets:  then the monster, then the man;
   Tattooed or woaded, winter-clad in skins,
   Raw from the prime, and crushing down his mate;
   As yet we find in barbarous isles, and here
   Among the lowest.'
                     Thereupon she took
   A bird's-eye-view of all the ungracious past;
   Glanced at the legendary Amazon
   As emblematic of a nobler age;
   Appraised the Lycian custom, spoke of those
   That lay at wine with Lar and Lucumo;
   Ran down the Persian, Grecian, Roman lines
   Of empire, and the woman's state in each,
   How far from just; till warming with her theme
   She fulmined out her scorn of laws Salique
   And little-footed China, touched on Mahomet
   With much contempt, and came to chivalry:
   When some respect, however slight, was paid
   To woman, superstition all awry:
   However then commenced the dawn:  a beam
   Had slanted forward, falling in a land
   Of promise; fruit would follow.  Deep, indeed,
   Their debt of thanks to her who first had dared
   To leap the rotten pales of prejudice,
   Disyoke their necks from custom, and assert
   None lordlier than themselves but that which made
   Woman and man.  She had founded; they must build.
   Here might they learn whatever men were taught:
   Let them not fear:  some said their heads were less:
   Some men's were small; not they the least of men;
   For often fineness compensated size:
   Besides the brain was like the hand, and grew
   With using; thence the man's, if more was more;
   He took advantage of his strength to be
   First in the field:  some ages had been lost;
   But woman ripened earlier, and her life
   Was longer; and albeit their glorious names
   Were fewer, scattered stars, yet since in truth
   The highest is the measure of the man,
   And not the Kaffir, Hottentot, Malay,
   Nor those horn-handed breakers of the glebe,
   But Homer, Plato, Verulam; even so
   With woman:  and in arts of government
   Elizabeth and others; arts of war
   The peasant Joan and others; arts of grace
   Sappho and others vied with any man:
   And, last not least, she who had left her place,
   And bowed her state to them, that they might grow
   To use and power on this Oasis, lapt
   In the arms of leisure, sacred from the blight
   Of ancient influence and scorn.
                                  At last
   She rose upon a wind of prophecy
   Dilating on the future; 'everywhere
   Who heads in council, two beside the hearth,
   Two in the tangled business of the world,
   Two in the liberal offices of life,
   Two plummets dropt for one to sound the abyss
   Of science, and the secrets of the mind:
   Musician, painter, sculptor, critic, more:
   And everywhere the broad and bounteous Earth
   Should bear a double growth of those rare souls,
   Poets, whose thoughts enrich the blood of the world.'

        She ended here, and beckoned us:  the rest
   Parted; and, glowing full-faced welcome, she
   Began to address us, and was moving on
   In gratulation, till as when a boat
   Tacks, and the slackened sail flaps, all her voice
   Faltering and fluttering in her throat, she cried
   'My brother!'  'Well, my sister.'  'O,' she said,
   'What do you here? and in this dress? and these?
   Why who are these? a wolf within the fold!
   A pack of wolves! the Lord be gracious to me!
   A plot, a plot, a plot to ruin all!'
   'No plot, no plot,' he answered.  'Wretched boy,
   How saw you not the inscription on the gate,
   LET NO MAN ENTER IN ON PAIN OF DEATH?'
   'And if I had,' he answered, 'who could think
   The softer Adams of your Academe,
   O sister, Sirens though they be, were such
   As chanted on the blanching bones of men?'
   'But you will find it otherwise' she said.
   'You jest:  ill jesting with edge-tools! my vow
   Binds me to speak, and O that iron will,
   That axelike edge unturnable, our Head,
   The Princess.'  'Well then, Psyche, take my life,
   And nail me like a weasel on a grange
   For warning:  bury me beside the gate,
   And cut this epitaph above my bones;
   _Here lies a brother by a sister slain,
   All for the common good of womankind._'
   'Let me die too,' said Cyril, 'having seen
   And heard the Lady Psyche.'
                              I struck in:
   'Albeit so masked, Madam, I love the truth;
   Receive it; and in me behold the Prince
   Your countryman, affianced years ago
   To the Lady Ida:  here, for here she was,
   And thus (what other way was left) I came.'
   'O Sir, O Prince, I have no country; none;
   If any, this; but none.  Whate'er I was
   Disrooted, what I am is grafted here.
   Affianced, Sir? love-whispers may not breathe
   Within this vestal limit, and how should I,
   Who am not mine, say, live:  the thunderbolt
   Hangs silent; but prepare:  I speak; it falls.'
   'Yet pause,' I said: 'for that inscription there,
   I think no more of deadly lurks therein,
   Than in a clapper clapping in a garth,
   To scare the fowl from fruit:  if more there be,
   If more and acted on, what follows? war;
   Your own work marred:  for this your Academe,
   Whichever side be Victor, in the halloo
   Will topple to the trumpet down, and pass
   With all fair theories only made to gild
   A stormless summer.'  'Let the Princess judge
   Of that' she said:  'farewell, Sir--and to you.
   I shudder at the sequel, but I go.'

        'Are you that Lady Psyche,' I rejoined,
   'The fifth in line from that old Florian,
   Yet hangs his portrait in my father's hall
   (The gaunt old Baron with his beetle brow
   Sun-shaded in the heat of dusty fights)
   As he bestrode my Grandsire, when he fell,
   And all else fled? we point to it, and we say,
   The loyal warmth of Florian is not cold,
   But branches current yet in kindred veins.'
   'Are you that Psyche,' Florian added; 'she
   With whom I sang about the morning hills,
   Flung ball, flew kite, and raced the purple fly,
   And snared the squirrel of the glen? are you
   That Psyche, wont to bind my throbbing brow,
   To smoothe my pillow, mix the foaming draught
   Of fever, tell me pleasant tales, and read
   My sickness down to happy dreams? are you
   That brother-sister Psyche, both in one?
   You were that Psyche, but what are you now?'
   'You are that Psyche,' said Cyril, 'for whom
   I would be that for ever which I seem,
   Woman, if I might sit beside your feet,
   And glean your scattered sapience.'
                                      Then once more,
   'Are you that Lady Psyche,' I began,
   'That on her bridal morn before she past
   From all her old companions, when the kind
   Kissed her pale cheek, declared that ancient ties
   Would still be dear beyond the southern hills;
   That were there any of our people there
   In want or peril, there was one to hear
   And help them? look! for such are these and I.'
   'Are you that Psyche,' Florian asked, 'to whom,
   In gentler days, your arrow-wounded fawn
   Came flying while you sat beside the well?
   The creature laid his muzzle on your lap,
   And sobbed, and you sobbed with it, and the blood
   Was sprinkled on your kirtle, and you wept.
   That was fawn's blood, not brother's, yet you wept.
   O by the bright head of my little niece,
   You were that Psyche, and what are you now?'
   'You are that Psyche,' Cyril said again,
   'The mother of the sweetest little maid,
   That ever crowed for kisses.'
                                'Out upon it!'
   She answered, 'peace! and why should I not play
   The Spartan Mother with emotion, be
   The Lucius Junius Brutus of my kind?
   Him you call great:  he for the common weal,
   The fading politics of mortal Rome,
   As I might slay this child, if good need were,
   Slew both his sons:  and I, shall I, on whom
   The secular emancipation turns
   Of half this world, be swerved from right to save
   A prince, a brother? a little will I yield.
   Best so, perchance, for us, and well for you.
   O hard, when love and duty clash!  I fear
   My conscience will not count me fleckless; yet--
   Hear my conditions:  promise (otherwise
   You perish) as you came, to slip away
   Today, tomorrow, soon:  it shall be said,
   These women were too barbarous, would not learn;
   They fled, who might have shamed us:  promise, all.'

        What could we else, we promised each; and she,
   Like some wild creature newly-caged, commenced
   A to-and-fro, so pacing till she paused
   By Florian; holding out her lily arms
   Took both his hands, and smiling faintly said:
   'I knew you at the first:  though you have grown
   You scarce have altered:  I am sad and glad
   To see you, Florian.  _I_ give thee to death
   My brother! it was duty spoke, not I.
   My needful seeming harshness, pardon it.
   Our mother, is she well?'
                            With that she kissed
   His forehead, then, a moment after, clung
   About him, and betwixt them blossomed up
   From out a common vein of memory
   Sweet household talk, and phrases of the hearth,
   And far allusion, till the gracious dews
   Began to glisten and to fall:  and while
   They stood, so rapt, we gazing, came a voice,
   'I brought a message here from Lady Blanche.'
   Back started she, and turning round we saw
   The Lady Blanche's daughter where she stood,
   Melissa, with her hand upon the lock,
   A rosy blonde, and in a college gown,
   That clad her like an April daffodilly
   (Her mother's colour) with her lips apart,
   And all her thoughts as fair within her eyes,
   As bottom agates seen to wave and float
   In crystal currents of clear morning seas.

        So stood that same fair creature at the door.
   Then Lady Psyche, 'Ah--Melissa--you!
   You heard us?' and Melissa, 'O pardon me
   I heard, I could not help it, did not wish:
   But, dearest Lady, pray you fear me not,
   Nor think I bear that heart within my breast,
   To give three gallant gentlemen to death.'
   'I trust you,' said the other, 'for we two
   Were always friends, none closer, elm and vine:
   But yet your mother's jealous temperament--
   Let not your prudence, dearest, drowse, or prove
   The Danaid of a leaky vase, for fear
   This whole foundation ruin, and I lose
   My honour, these their lives.'  'Ah, fear me not'
   Replied Melissa; 'no--I would not tell,
   No, not for all Aspasia's cleverness,
   No, not to answer, Madam, all those hard things
   That Sheba came to ask of Solomon.'
   'Be it so' the other, 'that we still may lead
   The new light up, and culminate in peace,
   For Solomon may come to Sheba yet.'
   Said Cyril, 'Madam, he the wisest man
   Feasted the woman wisest then, in halls
   Of Lebanonian cedar:  nor should you
   (Though, Madam, _you_ should answer, _we_ would ask)
   Less welcome find among us, if you came
   Among us, debtors for our lives to you,
   Myself for something more.'  He said not what,
   But 'Thanks,' she answered 'Go:  we have been too long
   Together:  keep your hoods about the face;
   They do so that affect abstraction here.
   Speak little; mix not with the rest; and hold
   Your promise:  all, I trust, may yet be well.'

        We turned to go, but Cyril took the child,
   And held her round the knees against his waist,
   And blew the swollen cheek of a trumpeter,
   While Psyche watched them, smiling, and the child
   Pushed her flat hand against his face and laughed;
   And thus our conference closed.
                                  And then we strolled
   For half the day through stately theatres
   Benched crescent-wise.  In each we sat, we heard
   The grave Professor.  On the lecture slate
   The circle rounded under female hands
   With flawless demonstration:  followed then
   A classic lecture, rich in sentiment,
   With scraps of thunderous Epic lilted out
   By violet-hooded Doctors, elegies
   And quoted odes, and jewels five-words-long
   That on the stretched forefinger of all Time
   Sparkle for ever:  then we dipt in all
   That treats of whatsoever is, the state,
   The total chronicles of man, the mind,
   The morals, something of the frame, the rock,
   The star, the bird, the fish, the shell, the flower,
   Electric, chemic laws, and all the rest,
   And whatsoever can be taught and known;
   Till like three horses that have broken fence,
   And glutted all night long breast-deep in corn,
   We issued gorged with knowledge, and I spoke:
   'Why, Sirs, they do all this as well as we.'
   'They hunt old trails' said Cyril 'very well;
   But when did woman ever yet invent?'
   'Ungracious!' answered Florian; 'have you learnt
   No more from Psyche's lecture, you that talked
   The trash that made me sick, and almost sad?'
   'O trash' he said, 'but with a kernel in it.
   Should I not call her wise, who made me wise?
   And learnt?  I learnt more from her in a flash,
   Than in my brainpan were an empty hull,
   And every Muse tumbled a science in.
   A thousand hearts lie fallow in these halls,
   And round these halls a thousand baby loves
   Fly twanging headless arrows at the hearts,
   Whence follows many a vacant pang; but O
   With me, Sir, entered in the bigger boy,
   The Head of all the golden-shafted firm,
   The long-limbed lad that had a Psyche too;
   He cleft me through the stomacher; and now
   What think you of it, Florian? do I chase
   The substance or the shadow? will it hold?
   I have no sorcerer's malison on me,
   No ghostly hauntings like his Highness.  I
   Flatter myself that always everywhere
   I know the substance when I see it.  Well,
   Are castles shadows?  Three of them?  Is she
   The sweet proprietress a shadow?  If not,
   Shall those three castles patch my tattered coat?
   For dear are those three castles to my wants,
   And dear is sister Psyche to my heart,
   And two dear things are one of double worth,
   And much I might have said, but that my zone
   Unmanned me:  then the Doctors!  O to hear
   The Doctors!  O to watch the thirsty plants
   Imbibing! once or twice I thought to roar,
   To break my chain, to shake my mane:  but thou,
   Modulate me, Soul of mincing mimicry!
   Make liquid treble of that bassoon, my throat;
   Abase those eyes that ever loved to meet
   Star-sisters answering under crescent brows;
   Abate the stride, which speaks of man, and loose
   A flying charm of blushes o'er this cheek,
   Where they like swallows coming out of time
   Will wonder why they came:  but hark the bell
   For dinner, let us go!'
                          And in we streamed
   Among the columns, pacing staid and still
   By twos and threes, till all from end to end
   With beauties every shade of brown and fair
   In colours gayer than the morning mist,
   The long hall glittered like a bed of flowers.
   How might a man not wander from his wits
   Pierced through with eyes, but that I kept mine own
   Intent on her, who rapt in glorious dreams,
   The second-sight of some Astraean age,
   Sat compassed with professors:  they, the while,
   Discussed a doubt and tost it to and fro:
   A clamour thickened, mixt with inmost terms
   Of art and science:  Lady Blanche alone
   Of faded form and haughtiest lineaments,
   With all her autumn tresses falsely brown,
   Shot sidelong daggers at us, a tiger-cat
   In act to spring.
                    At last a solemn grace
   Concluded, and we sought the gardens:  there
   One walked reciting by herself, and one
   In this hand held a volume as to read,
   And smoothed a petted peacock down with that:
   Some to a low song oared a shallop by,
   Or under arches of the marble bridge
   Hung, shadowed from the heat:  some hid and sought
   In the orange thickets:  others tost a ball
   Above the fountain-jets, and back again
   With laughter:  others lay about the lawns,
   Of the older sort, and murmured that their May
   Was passing:  what was learning unto them?
   They wished to marry; they could rule a house;
   Men hated learned women:  but we three
   Sat muffled like the Fates; and often came
   Melissa hitting all we saw with shafts
   Of gentle satire, kin to charity,
   That harmed not:  then day droopt; the chapel bells
   Called us:  we left the walks; we mixt with those
   Six hundred maidens clad in purest white,
   Before two streams of light from wall to wall,
   While the great organ almost burst his pipes,
   Groaning for power, and rolling through the court
   A long melodious thunder to the sound
   Of solemn psalms, and silver litanies,
   The work of Ida, to call down from Heaven
   A blessing on her labours for the world.


   Sweet and low, sweet and low,
      Wind of the western sea,
   Low, low, breathe and blow,
      Wind of the western sea!
   Over the rolling waters go,
   Come from the dying moon, and blow,
      Blow him again to me;
   While my little one, while my pretty one, sleeps.

   Sleep and rest, sleep and rest,
      Father will come to thee soon;
   Rest, rest, on mother's breast,
      Father will come to thee soon;
   Father will come to his babe in the nest,
   Silver sails all out of the west
      Under the silver moon:
   Sleep, my little one, sleep, my pretty one, sleep.




III



   Morn in the wake of the morning star
   Came furrowing all the orient into gold.
   We rose, and each by other drest with care
   Descended to the court that lay three parts
   In shadow, but the Muses' heads were touched
   Above the darkness from their native East.

        There while we stood beside the fount, and watched
   Or seemed to watch the dancing bubble, approached
   Melissa, tinged with wan from lack of sleep,
   Or grief, and glowing round her dewy eyes
   The circled Iris of a night of tears;
   'And fly,' she cried, 'O fly, while yet you may!
   My mother knows:'  and when I asked her 'how,'
   'My fault' she wept 'my fault! and yet not mine;
   Yet mine in part.  O hear me, pardon me.
   My mother, 'tis her wont from night to night
   To rail at Lady Psyche and her side.
   She says the Princess should have been the Head,
   Herself and Lady Psyche the two arms;
   And so it was agreed when first they came;
   But Lady Psyche was the right hand now,
   And the left, or not, or seldom used;
   Hers more than half the students, all the love.
   And so last night she fell to canvass you:
   _Her_ countrywomen! she did not envy her.
   "Who ever saw such wild barbarians?
   Girls?--more like men!" and at these words the snake,
   My secret, seemed to stir within my breast;
   And oh, Sirs, could I help it, but my cheek
   Began to burn and burn, and her lynx eye
   To fix and make me hotter, till she laughed:
   "O marvellously modest maiden, you!
   Men! girls, like men! why, if they had been men
   You need not set your thoughts in rubric thus
   For wholesale comment."  Pardon, I am shamed
   That I must needs repeat for my excuse
   What looks so little graceful:  "men" (for still
   My mother went revolving on the word)
   "And so they are,--very like men indeed--
   And with that woman closeted for hours!"
   Then came these dreadful words out one by one,
   "Why--these--_are_--men:"  I shuddered:  "and you know it."
   "O ask me nothing," I said:  "And she knows too,
   And she conceals it."  So my mother clutched
   The truth at once, but with no word from me;
   And now thus early risen she goes to inform
   The Princess:  Lady Psyche will be crushed;
   But you may yet be saved, and therefore fly;
   But heal me with your pardon ere you go.'

        'What pardon, sweet Melissa, for a blush?'
   Said Cyril:  'Pale one, blush again:  than wear
   Those lilies, better blush our lives away.
   Yet let us breathe for one hour more in Heaven'
   He added, 'lest some classic Angel speak
   In scorn of us, "They mounted, Ganymedes,
   To tumble, Vulcans, on the second morn."
   But I will melt this marble into wax
   To yield us farther furlough:'  and he went.

        Melissa shook her doubtful curls, and thought
   He scarce would prosper.  'Tell us,' Florian asked,
   'How grew this feud betwixt the right and left.'
   'O long ago,' she said, 'betwixt these two
   Division smoulders hidden; 'tis my mother,
   Too jealous, often fretful as the wind
   Pent in a crevice:  much I bear with her:
   I never knew my father, but she says
   (God help her) she was wedded to a fool;
   And still she railed against the state of things.
   She had the care of Lady Ida's youth,
   And from the Queen's decease she brought her up.
   But when your sister came she won the heart
   Of Ida:  they were still together, grew
   (For so they said themselves) inosculated;
   Consonant chords that shiver to one note;
   One mind in all things:  yet my mother still
   Affirms your Psyche thieved her theories,
   And angled with them for her pupil's love:
   She calls her plagiarist; I know not what:
   But I must go:  I dare not tarry,' and light,
   As flies the shadow of a bird, she fled.

        Then murmured Florian gazing after her,
   'An open-hearted maiden, true and pure.
   If I could love, why this were she:  how pretty
   Her blushing was, and how she blushed again,
   As if to close with Cyril's random wish:
   Not like your Princess crammed with erring pride,
   Nor like poor Psyche whom she drags in tow.'

        'The crane,' I said, 'may chatter of the crane,
   The dove may murmur of the dove, but I
   An eagle clang an eagle to the sphere.
   My princess, O my princess! true she errs,
   But in her own grand way:  being herself
   Three times more noble than three score of men,
   She sees herself in every woman else,
   And so she wears her error like a crown
   To blind the truth and me:  for her, and her,
   Hebes are they to hand ambrosia, mix
   The nectar; but--ah she--whene'er she moves
   The Samian Here rises and she speaks
   A Memnon smitten with the morning Sun.'

        So saying from the court we paced, and gained
   The terrace ranged along the Northern front,
   And leaning there on those balusters, high
   Above the empurpled champaign, drank the gale
   That blown about the foliage underneath,
   And sated with the innumerable rose,
   Beat balm upon our eyelids.  Hither came
   Cyril, and yawning 'O hard task,' he cried;
   'No fighting shadows here!  I forced a way
   Through opposition crabbed and gnarled.
   Better to clear prime forests, heave and thump
   A league of street in summer solstice down,
   Than hammer at this reverend gentlewoman.
   I knocked and, bidden, entered; found her there
   At point to move, and settled in her eyes
   The green malignant light of coming storm.
   Sir, I was courteous, every phrase well-oiled,
   As man's could be; yet maiden-meek I prayed
   Concealment:  she demanded who we were,
   And why we came?  I fabled nothing fair,
   But, your example pilot, told her all.
   Up went the hushed amaze of hand and eye.
   But when I dwelt upon your old affiance,
   She answered sharply that I talked astray.
   I urged the fierce inscription on the gate,
   And our three lives.  True--we had limed ourselves
   With open eyes, and we must take the chance.
   But such extremes, I told her, well might harm
   The woman's cause.  "Not more than now," she said,
   "So puddled as it is with favouritism."
   I tried the mother's heart.  Shame might befall
   Melissa, knowing, saying not she knew:
   Her answer was "Leave me to deal with that."
   I spoke of war to come and many deaths,
   And she replied, her duty was to speak,
   And duty duty, clear of consequences.
   I grew discouraged, Sir; but since I knew
   No rock so hard but that a little wave
   May beat admission in a thousand years,
   I recommenced; "Decide not ere you pause.
   I find you here but in the second place,
   Some say the third--the authentic foundress you.
   I offer boldly:  we will seat you highest:
   Wink at our advent:  help my prince to gain
   His rightful bride, and here I promise you
   Some palace in our land, where you shall reign
   The head and heart of all our fair she-world,
   And your great name flow on with broadening time
   For ever."  Well, she balanced this a little,
   And told me she would answer us today,
   meantime be mute:  thus much, nor more I gained.'

        He ceasing, came a message from the Head.
   'That afternoon the Princess rode to take
   The dip of certain strata to the North.
   Would we go with her? we should find the land
   Worth seeing; and the river made a fall
   Out yonder:'  then she pointed on to where
   A double hill ran up his furrowy forks
   Beyond the thick-leaved platans of the vale.

        Agreed to, this, the day fled on through all
   Its range of duties to the appointed hour.
   Then summoned to the porch we went.  She stood
   Among her maidens, higher by the head,
   Her back against a pillar, her foot on one
   Of those tame leopards.  Kittenlike he rolled
   And pawed about her sandal.  I drew near;
   I gazed.  On a sudden my strange seizure came
   Upon me, the weird vision of our house:
   The Princess Ida seemed a hollow show,
   Her gay-furred cats a painted fantasy,
   Her college and her maidens, empty masks,
   And I myself the shadow of a dream,
   For all things were and were not.  Yet I felt
   My heart beat thick with passion and with awe;
   Then from my breast the involuntary sigh
   Brake, as she smote me with the light of eyes
   That lent my knee desire to kneel, and shook
   My pulses, till to horse we got, and so
   Went forth in long retinue following up
   The river as it narrowed to the hills.

        I rode beside her and to me she said:
   'O friend, we trust that you esteemed us not
   Too harsh to your companion yestermorn;
   Unwillingly we spake.'  'No--not to her,'
   I answered, 'but to one of whom we spake
   Your Highness might have seemed the thing you say.'
   'Again?' she cried, 'are you ambassadresses
   From him to me? we give you, being strange,
   A license:  speak, and let the topic die.'

        I stammered that I knew him--could have wished--
   'Our king expects--was there no precontract?
   There is no truer-hearted--ah, you seem
   All he prefigured, and he could not see
   The bird of passage flying south but longed
   To follow:  surely, if your Highness keep
   Your purport, you will shock him even to death,
   Or baser courses, children of despair.'

        'Poor boy,' she said, 'can he not read--no books?
   Quoit, tennis, ball--no games? nor deals in that
   Which men delight in, martial exercise?
   To nurse a blind ideal like a girl,
   Methinks he seems no better than a girl;
   As girls were once, as we ourself have been:
   We had our dreams; perhaps he mixt with them:
   We touch on our dead self, nor shun to do it,
   Being other--since we learnt our meaning here,
   To lift the woman's fallen divinity
   Upon an even pedestal with man.'

        She paused, and added with a haughtier smile
   'And as to precontracts, we move, my friend,
   At no man's beck, but know ourself and thee,
   O Vashti, noble Vashti!  Summoned out
   She kept her state, and left the drunken king
   To brawl at Shushan underneath the palms.'

        'Alas your Highness breathes full East,' I said,
   'On that which leans to you.  I know the Prince,
   I prize his truth:  and then how vast a work
   To assail this gray preeminence of man!
   You grant me license; might I use it? think;
   Ere half be done perchance your life may fail;
   Then comes the feebler heiress of your plan,
   And takes and ruins all; and thus your pains
   May only make that footprint upon sand
   Which old-recurring waves of prejudice
   Resmooth to nothing:  might I dread that you,
   With only Fame for spouse and your great deeds
   For issue, yet may live in vain, and miss,
   Meanwhile, what every woman counts her due,
   Love, children, happiness?'
                              And she exclaimed,
   'Peace, you young savage of the Northern wild!
   What! though your Prince's love were like a God's,
   Have we not made ourself the sacrifice?
   You are bold indeed:  we are not talked to thus:
   Yet will we say for children, would they grew
   Like field-flowers everywhere! we like them well:
   But children die; and let me tell you, girl,
   Howe'er you babble, great deeds cannot die;
   They with the sun and moon renew their light
   For ever, blessing those that look on them.
   Children--that men may pluck them from our hearts,
   Kill us with pity, break us with ourselves--
   O--children--there is nothing upon earth
   More miserable than she that has a son
   And sees him err:  nor would we work for fame;
   Though she perhaps might reap the applause of Great,
   Who earns the one POU STO whence after-hands
   May move the world, though she herself effect
   But little:  wherefore up and act, nor shrink
   For fear our solid aim be dissipated
   By frail successors.  Would, indeed, we had been,
   In lieu of many mortal flies, a race
   Of giants living, each, a thousand years,
   That we might see our own work out, and watch
   The sandy footprint harden into stone.'

        I answered nothing, doubtful in myself
   If that strange Poet-princess with her grand
   Imaginations might at all be won.
   And she broke out interpreting my thoughts:

        'No doubt we seem a kind of monster to you;
   We are used to that:  for women, up till this
   Cramped under worse than South-sea-isle taboo,
   Dwarfs of the gynaeceum, fail so far
   In high desire, they know not, cannot guess
   How much their welfare is a passion to us.
   If we could give them surer, quicker proof--
   Oh if our end were less achievable
   By slow approaches, than by single act
   Of immolation, any phase of death,
   We were as prompt to spring against the pikes,
   Or down the fiery gulf as talk of it,
   To compass our dear sisters' liberties.'

        She bowed as if to veil a noble tear;
   And up we came to where the river sloped
   To plunge in cataract, shattering on black blocks
   A breadth of thunder.  O'er it shook the woods,
   And danced the colour, and, below, stuck out
   The bones of some vast bulk that lived and roared
   Before man was.  She gazed awhile and said,
   'As these rude bones to us, are we to her
   That will be.'  'Dare we dream of that,' I asked,
   'Which wrought us, as the workman and his work,
   That practice betters?'  'How,' she cried, 'you love
   The metaphysics! read and earn our prize,
   A golden brooch:  beneath an emerald plane
   Sits Diotima, teaching him that died
   Of hemlock; our device; wrought to the life;
   She rapt upon her subject, he on her:
   For there are schools for all.'  'And yet' I said
   'Methinks I have not found among them all
   One anatomic.'  'Nay, we thought of that,'
   She answered, 'but it pleased us not:  in truth
   We shudder but to dream our maids should ape
   Those monstrous males that carve the living hound,
   And cram him with the fragments of the grave,
   Or in the dark dissolving human heart,
   And holy secrets of this microcosm,
   Dabbling a shameless hand with shameful jest,
   Encarnalize their spirits:  yet we know
   Knowledge is knowledge, and this matter hangs:
   Howbeit ourself, foreseeing casualty,
   Nor willing men should come among us, learnt,
   For many weary moons before we came,
   This craft of healing.  Were you sick, ourself
   Would tend upon you.  To your question now,
   Which touches on the workman and his work.
   Let there be light and there was light:  'tis so:
   For was, and is, and will be, are but is;
   And all creation is one act at once,
   The birth of light:  but we that are not all,
   As parts, can see but parts, now this, now that,
   And live, perforce, from thought to thought, and make
   One act a phantom of succession:  thus
   Our weakness somehow shapes the shadow, Time;
   But in the shadow will we work, and mould
   The woman to the fuller day.'
                                She spake
   With kindled eyes; we rode a league beyond,
   And, o'er a bridge of pinewood crossing, came
   On flowery levels underneath the crag,
   Full of all beauty.  'O how sweet' I said
   (For I was half-oblivious of my mask)
   'To linger here with one that loved us.'  'Yea,'
   She answered, 'or with fair philosophies
   That lift the fancy; for indeed these fields
   Are lovely, lovelier not the Elysian lawns,
   Where paced the Demigods of old, and saw
   The soft white vapour streak the crowned towers
   Built to the Sun:'  then, turning to her maids,
   'Pitch our pavilion here upon the sward;
   Lay out the viands.'  At the word, they raised
   A tent of satin, elaborately wrought
   With fair Corinna's triumph; here she stood,
   Engirt with many a florid maiden-cheek,
   The woman-conqueror; woman-conquered there
   The bearded Victor of ten-thousand hymns,
   And all the men mourned at his side:  but we
   Set forth to climb; then, climbing, Cyril kept
   With Psyche, with Melissa Florian, I
   With mine affianced.  Many a little hand
   Glanced like a touch of sunshine on the rocks,
   Many a light foot shone like a jewel set
   In the dark crag:  and then we turned, we wound
   About the cliffs, the copses, out and in,
   Hammering and clinking, chattering stony names
   Of shales and hornblende, rag and trap and tuff,
   Amygdaloid and trachyte, till the Sun
   Grew broader toward his death and fell, and all
   The rosy heights came out above the lawns.


      The splendour falls on castle walls
         And snowy summits old in story:
      The long light shakes across the lakes,
         And the wild cataract leaps in glory.
   Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,
   Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.

      O hark, O hear! how thin and clear,
         And thinner, clearer, farther going!
      O sweet and far from cliff and scar
         The horns of Elfland faintly blowing!
   Blow, let us hear the purple glens replying:
   Blow, bugle; answer, echoes, dying, dying, dying.

      O love, they die in yon rich sky,
         They faint on hill or field or river:
      Our echoes roll from soul to soul,
         And grow for ever and for ever.
   Blow, bugle, blow, set the wild echoes flying,
   And answer, echoes, answer, dying, dying, dying.




IV



   'There sinks the nebulous star we call the Sun,
   If that hypothesis of theirs be sound'
   Said Ida; 'let us down and rest;' and we
   Down from the lean and wrinkled precipices,
   By every coppice-feathered chasm and cleft,
   Dropt through the ambrosial gloom to where below
   No bigger than a glow-worm shone the tent
   Lamp-lit from the inner.  Once she leaned on me,
   Descending; once or twice she lent her hand,
   And blissful palpitations in the blood,
   Stirring a sudden transport rose and fell.

        But when we planted level feet, and dipt
   Beneath the satin dome and entered in,
   There leaning deep in broidered down we sank
   Our elbows:  on a tripod in the midst
   A fragrant flame rose, and before us glowed
   Fruit, blossom, viand, amber wine, and gold.

        Then she, 'Let some one sing to us:  lightlier move
   The minutes fledged with music:' and a maid,
   Of those beside her, smote her harp, and sang.


      'Tears, idle tears, I know not what they mean,
   Tears from the depth of some divine despair
   Rise in the heart, and gather to the eyes,
   In looking on the happy Autumn-fields,
   And thinking of the days that are no more.

      'Fresh as the first beam glittering on a sail,
   That brings our friends up from the underworld,
   Sad as the last which reddens over one
   That sinks with all we love below the verge;
   So sad, so fresh, the days that are no more.

      'Ah, sad and strange as in dark summer dawns
   The earliest pipe of half-awakened birds
   To dying ears, when unto dying eyes
   The casement slowly grows a glimmering square;
   So sad, so strange, the days that are no more.

      'Dear as remembered kisses after death,
   And sweet as those by hopeless fancy feigned
   On lips that are for others; deep as love,
   Deep as first love, and wild with all regret;
   O Death in Life, the days that are no more.'


        She ended with such passion that the tear,
   She sang of, shook and fell, an erring pearl
   Lost in her bosom:  but with some disdain
   Answered the Princess, 'If indeed there haunt
   About the mouldered lodges of the Past
   So sweet a voice and vague, fatal to men,
   Well needs it we should cram our ears with wool
   And so pace by:  but thine are fancies hatched
   In silken-folded idleness; nor is it
   Wiser to weep a true occasion lost,
   But trim our sails, and let old bygones be,
   While down the streams that float us each and all
   To the issue, goes, like glittering bergs of ice,
   Throne after throne, and molten on the waste
   Becomes a cloud:  for all things serve their time
   Toward that great year of equal mights and rights,
   Nor would I fight with iron laws, in the end
   Found golden:  let the past be past; let be
   Their cancelled Babels:  though the rough kex break
   The starred mosaic, and the beard-blown goat
   Hang on the shaft, and the wild figtree split
   Their monstrous idols, care not while we hear
   A trumpet in the distance pealing news
   Of better, and Hope, a poising eagle, burns
   Above the unrisen morrow:' then to me;
   'Know you no song of your own land,' she said,
   'Not such as moans about the retrospect,
   But deals with the other distance and the hues
   Of promise; not a death's-head at the wine.'

        Then I remembered one myself had made,
   What time I watched the swallow winging south
   From mine own land, part made long since, and part
   Now while I sang, and maidenlike as far
   As I could ape their treble, did I sing.


      'O Swallow, Swallow, flying, flying South,
   Fly to her, and fall upon her gilded eaves,
   And tell her, tell her, what I tell to thee.

      'O tell her, Swallow, thou that knowest each,
   That bright and fierce and fickle is the South,
   And dark and true and tender is the North.

      'O Swallow, Swallow, if I could follow, and light
   Upon her lattice, I would pipe and trill,
   And cheep and twitter twenty million loves.

      'O were I thou that she might take me in,
   And lay me on her bosom, and her heart
   Would rock the snowy cradle till I died.

      'Why lingereth she to clothe her heart with love,
   Delaying as the tender ash delays
   To clothe herself, when all the woods are green?

      'O tell her, Swallow, that thy brood is flown:
   Say to her, I do but wanton in the South,
   But in the North long since my nest is made.

      'O tell her, brief is life but love is long,
   And brief the sun of summer in the North,
   And brief the moon of beauty in the South.

      'O Swallow, flying from the golden woods,
   Fly to her, and pipe and woo her, and make her mine,
   And tell her, tell her, that I follow thee.'


        I ceased, and all the ladies, each at each,
   Like the Ithacensian suitors in old time,
   Stared with great eyes, and laughed with alien lips,
   And knew not what they meant; for still my voice
   Rang false:  but smiling 'Not for thee,' she said,
   O Bulbul, any rose of Gulistan
   Shall burst her veil:  marsh-divers, rather, maid,
   Shall croak thee sister, or the meadow-crake
   Grate her harsh kindred in the grass:  and this
   A mere love-poem!  O for such, my friend,
   We hold them slight:  they mind us of the time
   When we made bricks in Egypt.  Knaves are men,
   That lute and flute fantastic tenderness,
   And dress the victim to the offering up,
   And paint the gates of Hell with Paradise,
   And play the slave to gain the tyranny.
   Poor soul!  I had a maid of honour once;
   She wept her true eyes blind for such a one,
   A rogue of canzonets and serenades.
   I loved her.  Peace be with her.  She is dead.
   So they blaspheme the muse!  But great is song
   Used to great ends:  ourself have often tried
   Valkyrian hymns, or into rhythm have dashed
   The passion of the prophetess; for song
   Is duer unto freedom, force and growth
   Of spirit than to junketing and love.
   Love is it?  Would this same mock-love, and this
   Mock-Hymen were laid up like winter bats,
   Till all men grew to rate us at our worth,
   Not vassals to be beat, nor pretty babes
   To be dandled, no, but living wills, and sphered
   Whole in ourselves and owed to none.  Enough!
   But now to leaven play with profit, you,
   Know you no song, the true growth of your soil,
   That gives the manners of your country-women?'

        She spoke and turned her sumptuous head with eyes
   Of shining expectation fixt on mine.
   Then while I dragged my brains for such a song,
   Cyril, with whom the bell-mouthed glass had wrought,
   Or mastered by the sense of sport, began
   To troll a careless, careless tavern-catch
   Of Moll and Meg, and strange experiences
   Unmeet for ladies.  Florian nodded at him,
   I frowning; Psyche flushed and wanned and shook;
   The lilylike Melissa drooped her brows;
   'Forbear,' the Princess cried; 'Forbear, Sir' I;
   And heated through and through with wrath and love,
   I smote him on the breast; he started up;
   There rose a shriek as of a city sacked;
   Melissa clamoured 'Flee the death;' 'To horse'
   Said Ida; 'home! to horse!' and fled, as flies
   A troop of snowy doves athwart the dusk,
   When some one batters at the dovecote-doors,
   Disorderly the women.  Alone I stood
   With Florian, cursing Cyril, vext at heart,
   In the pavilion:  there like parting hopes
   I heard them passing from me:  hoof by hoof,
   And every hoof a knell to my desires,
   Clanged on the bridge; and then another shriek,
   'The Head, the Head, the Princess, O the Head!'
   For blind with rage she missed the plank, and rolled
   In the river.  Out I sprang from glow to gloom:
   There whirled her white robe like a blossomed branch
   Rapt to the horrible fall:  a glance I gave,
   No more; but woman-vested as I was
   Plunged; and the flood drew; yet I caught her; then
   Oaring one arm, and bearing in my left
   The weight of all the hopes of half the world,
   Strove to buffet to land in vain.  A tree
   Was half-disrooted from his place and stooped
   To wrench his dark locks in the gurgling wave
   Mid-channel.  Right on this we drove and caught,
   And grasping down the boughs I gained the shore.

        There stood her maidens glimmeringly grouped
   In the hollow bank.  One reaching forward drew
   My burthen from mine arms; they cried 'she lives:'
   They bore her back into the tent:  but I,
   So much a kind of shame within me wrought,
   Not yet endured to meet her opening eyes,
   Nor found my friends; but pushed alone on foot
   (For since her horse was lost I left her mine)
   Across the woods, and less from Indian craft
   Than beelike instinct hiveward, found at length
   The garden portals.  Two great statues, Art
   And Science, Caryatids, lifted up
   A weight of emblem, and betwixt were valves
   Of open-work in which the hunter rued
   His rash intrusion, manlike, but his brows
   Had sprouted, and the branches thereupon
   Spread out at top, and grimly spiked the gates.

        A little space was left between the horns,
   Through which I clambered o'er at top with pain,
   Dropt on the sward, and up the linden walks,
   And, tost on thoughts that changed from hue to hue,
   Now poring on the glowworm, now the star,
   I paced the terrace, till the Bear had wheeled
   Through a great arc his seven slow suns.
                                           A step
   Of lightest echo, then a loftier form
   Than female, moving through the uncertain gloom,
   Disturbed me with the doubt 'if this were she,'
   But it was Florian.  'Hist O Hist,' he said,
   'They seek us:  out so late is out of rules.
   Moreover "seize the strangers" is the cry.
   How came you here?' I told him:  'I' said he,
   'Last of the train, a moral leper, I,
   To whom none spake, half-sick at heart, returned.
   Arriving all confused among the rest
   With hooded brows I crept into the hall,
   And, couched behind a Judith, underneath
   The head of Holofernes peeped and saw.
   Girl after girl was called to trial:  each
   Disclaimed all knowledge of us:  last of all,
   Melissa:  trust me, Sir, I pitied her.
   She, questioned if she knew us men, at first
   Was silent; closer prest, denied it not:
   And then, demanded if her mother knew,
   Or Psyche, she affirmed not, or denied:
   From whence the Royal mind, familiar with her,
   Easily gathered either guilt.  She sent
   For Psyche, but she was not there; she called
   For Psyche's child to cast it from the doors;
   She sent for Blanche to accuse her face to face;
   And I slipt out:  but whither will you now?
   And where are Psyche, Cyril? both are fled:
   What, if together? that were not so well.
   Would rather we had never come!  I dread
   His wildness, and the chances of the dark.'

        'And yet,' I said, 'you wrong him more than I
   That struck him:  this is proper to the clown,
   Though smocked, or furred and purpled, still the clown,
   To harm the thing that trusts him, and to shame
   That which he says he loves:  for Cyril, howe'er
   He deal in frolic, as tonight--the song
   Might have been worse and sinned in grosser lips
   Beyond all pardon--as it is, I hold
   These flashes on the surface are not he.
   He has a solid base of temperament:
   But as the waterlily starts and slides
   Upon the level in little puffs of wind,
   Though anchored to the bottom, such is he.'

        Scarce had I ceased when from a tamarisk near
   Two Proctors leapt upon us, crying, 'Names:'
   He, standing still, was clutched; but I began
   To thrid the musky-circled mazes, wind
   And double in and out the boles, and race
   By all the fountains:  fleet I was of foot:
   Before me showered the rose in flakes; behind
   I heard the puffed pursuer; at mine ear
   Bubbled the nightingale and heeded not,
   And secret laughter tickled all my soul.
   At last I hooked my ankle in a vine,
   That claspt the feet of a Mnemosyne,
   And falling on my face was caught and known.

        They haled us to the Princess where she sat
   High in the hall:  above her drooped a lamp,
   And made the single jewel on her brow
   Burn like the mystic fire on a mast-head,
   Prophet of storm:  a handmaid on each side
   Bowed toward her, combing out her long black hair
   Damp from the river; and close behind her stood
   Eight daughters of the plough, stronger than men,
   Huge women blowzed with health, and wind, and rain,
   And labour.  Each was like a Druid rock;
   Or like a spire of land that stands apart
   Cleft from the main, and wailed about with mews.

        Then, as we came, the crowd dividing clove
   An advent to the throne:  and therebeside,
   Half-naked as if caught at once from bed
   And tumbled on the purple footcloth, lay
   The lily-shining child; and on the left,
   Bowed on her palms and folded up from wrong,
   Her round white shoulder shaken with her sobs,
   Melissa knelt; but Lady Blanche erect
   Stood up and spake, an affluent orator.

        'It was not thus, O Princess, in old days:
   You prized my counsel, lived upon my lips:
   I led you then to all the Castalies;
   I fed you with the milk of every Muse;
   I loved you like this kneeler, and you me
   Your second mother:  those were gracious times.
   Then came your new friend:  you began to change--
   I saw it and grieved--to slacken and to cool;
   Till taken with her seeming openness
   You turned your warmer currents all to her,
   To me you froze:  this was my meed for all.
   Yet I bore up in part from ancient love,
   And partly that I hoped to win you back,
   And partly conscious of my own deserts,
   And partly that you were my civil head,
   And chiefly you were born for something great,
   In which I might your fellow-worker be,
   When time should serve; and thus a noble scheme
   Grew up from seed we two long since had sown;
   In us true growth, in her a Jonah's gourd,
   Up in one night and due to sudden sun:
   We took this palace; but even from the first
   You stood in your own light and darkened mine.
   What student came but that you planed her path
   To Lady Psyche, younger, not so wise,
   A foreigner, and I your countrywoman,
   I your old friend and tried, she new in all?
   But still her lists were swelled and mine were lean;
   Yet I bore up in hope she would be known:
   Then came these wolves:  _they_ knew her:  _they_ endured,
   Long-closeted with her the yestermorn,
   To tell her what they were, and she to hear:
   And me none told:  not less to an eye like mine
   A lidless watcher of the public weal,
   Last night, their mask was patent, and my foot
   Was to you:  but I thought again:  I feared
   To meet a cold "We thank you, we shall hear of it
   From Lady Psyche:" you had gone to her,
   She told, perforce; and winning easy grace
   No doubt, for slight delay, remained among us
   In our young nursery still unknown, the stem
   Less grain than touchwood, while my honest heat
   Were all miscounted as malignant haste
   To push my rival out of place and power.
   But public use required she should be known;
   And since my oath was ta'en for public use,
   I broke the letter of it to keep the sense.
   I spoke not then at first, but watched them well,
   Saw that they kept apart, no mischief done;
   And yet this day (though you should hate me for it)
   I came to tell you; found that you had gone,
   Ridden to the hills, she likewise:  now, I thought,
   That surely she will speak; if not, then I:
   Did she?  These monsters blazoned what they were,
   According to the coarseness of their kind,
   For thus I hear; and known at last (my work)
   And full of cowardice and guilty shame,
   I grant in her some sense of shame, she flies;
   And I remain on whom to wreak your rage,
   I, that have lent my life to build up yours,
   I that have wasted here health, wealth, and time,
   And talent, I--you know it--I will not boast:
   Dismiss me, and I prophesy your plan,
   Divorced from my experience, will be chaff
   For every gust of chance, and men will say
   We did not know the real light, but chased
   The wisp that flickers where no foot can tread.'

        She ceased:  the Princess answered coldly, 'Good:
   Your oath is broken:  we dismiss you:  go.
   For this lost lamb (she pointed to the child)
   Our mind is changed:  we take it to ourself.'

        Thereat the Lady stretched a vulture throat,
   And shot from crooked lips a haggard smile.
   'The plan was mine.  I built the nest' she said
   'To hatch the cuckoo.  Rise!' and stooped to updrag
   Melissa:  she, half on her mother propt,
   Half-drooping from her, turned her face, and cast
   A liquid look on Ida, full of prayer,
   Which melted Florian's fancy as she hung,
   A Niobean daughter, one arm out,
   Appealing to the bolts of Heaven; and while
   We gazed upon her came a little stir
   About the doors, and on a sudden rushed
   Among us, out of breath as one pursued,
   A woman-post in flying raiment.  Fear
   Stared in her eyes, and chalked her face, and winged
   Her transit to the throne, whereby she fell
   Delivering sealed dispatches which the Head
   Took half-amazed, and in her lion's mood
   Tore open, silent we with blind surmise
   Regarding, while she read, till over brow
   And cheek and bosom brake the wrathful bloom
   As of some fire against a stormy cloud,
   When the wild peasant rights himself, the rick
   Flames, and his anger reddens in the heavens;
   For anger most it seemed, while now her breast,
   Beaten with some great passion at her heart,
   Palpitated, her hand shook, and we heard
   In the dead hush the papers that she held
   Rustle:  at once the lost lamb at her feet
   Sent out a bitter bleating for its dam;
   The plaintive cry jarred on her ire; she crushed
   The scrolls together, made a sudden turn
   As if to speak, but, utterance failing her,
   She whirled them on to me, as who should say
   'Read,' and I read--two letters--one her sire's.

        'Fair daughter, when we sent the Prince your way,
   We knew not your ungracious laws, which learnt,
   We, conscious of what temper you are built,
   Came all in haste to hinder wrong, but fell
   Into his father's hands, who has this night,
   You lying close upon his territory,
   Slipt round and in the dark invested you,
   And here he keeps me hostage for his son.'

        The second was my father's running thus:
   'You have our son:  touch not a hair of his head:
   Render him up unscathed:  give him your hand:
   Cleave to your contract:  though indeed we hear
   You hold the woman is the better man;
   A rampant heresy, such as if it spread
   Would make all women kick against their Lords
   Through all the world, and which might well deserve
   That we this night should pluck your palace down;
   And we will do it, unless you send us back
   Our son, on the instant, whole.'
                                   So far I read;
   And then stood up and spoke impetuously.

        'O not to pry and peer on your reserve,
   But led by golden wishes, and a hope
   The child of regal compact, did I break
   Your precinct; not a scorner of your sex
   But venerator, zealous it should be
   All that it might be:  hear me, for I bear,
   Though man, yet human, whatsoe'er your wrongs,
   From the flaxen curl to the gray lock a life
   Less mine than yours:  my nurse would tell me of you;
   I babbled for you, as babies for the moon,
   Vague brightness; when a boy, you stooped to me
   From all high places, lived in all fair lights,
   Came in long breezes rapt from inmost south
   And blown to inmost north; at eve and dawn
   With Ida, Ida, Ida, rang the woods;
   The leader wildswan in among the stars
   Would clang it, and lapt in wreaths of glowworm light
   The mellow breaker murmured Ida.  Now,
   Because I would have reached you, had you been
   Sphered up with Cassiopeia, or the enthroned
   Persephone in Hades, now at length,
   Those winters of abeyance all worn out,
   A man I came to see you:  but indeed,
   Not in this frequence can I lend full tongue,
   O noble Ida, to those thoughts that wait
   On you, their centre:  let me say but this,
   That many a famous man and woman, town
   And landskip, have I heard of, after seen
   The dwarfs of presage:  though when known, there grew
   Another kind of beauty in detail
   Made them worth knowing; but in your I found
   My boyish dream involved and dazzled down
   And mastered, while that after-beauty makes
   Such head from act to act, from hour to hour,
   Within me, that except you slay me here,
   According to your bitter statute-book,
   I cannot cease to follow you, as they say
   The seal does music; who desire you more
   Than growing boys their manhood; dying lips,
   With many thousand matters left to do,
   The breath of life; O more than poor men wealth,
   Than sick men health--yours, yours, not mine--but half
   Without you; with you, whole; and of those halves
   You worthiest; and howe'er you block and bar
   Your heart with system out from mine, I hold
   That it becomes no man to nurse despair,
   But in the teeth of clenched antagonisms
   To follow up the worthiest till he die:
   Yet that I came not all unauthorized
   Behold your father's letter.'
                                On one knee
   Kneeling, I gave it, which she caught, and dashed
   Unopened at her feet:  a tide of fierce
   Invective seemed to wait behind her lips,
   As waits a river level with the dam
   Ready to burst and flood the world with foam:
   And so she would have spoken, but there rose
   A hubbub in the court of half the maids
   Gathered together:  from the illumined hall
   Long lanes of splendour slanted o'er a press
   Of snowy shoulders, thick as herded ewes,
   And rainbow robes, and gems and gemlike eyes,
   And gold and golden heads; they to and fro
   Fluctuated, as flowers in storm, some red, some pale,
   All open-mouthed, all gazing to the light,
   Some crying there was an army in the land,
   And some that men were in the very walls,
   And some they cared not; till a clamour grew
   As of a new-world Babel, woman-built,
   And worse-confounded:  high above them stood
   The placid marble Muses, looking peace.

        Not peace she looked, the Head:  but rising up
   Robed in the long night of her deep hair, so
   To the open window moved, remaining there
   Fixt like a beacon-tower above the waves
   Of tempest, when the crimson-rolling eye
   Glares ruin, and the wild birds on the light
   Dash themselves dead.  She stretched her arms and called
   Across the tumult and the tumult fell.

        'What fear ye, brawlers? am not I your Head?
   On me, me, me, the storm first breaks:  _I_ dare
   All these male thunderbolts:  what is it ye fear?
   Peace! there are those to avenge us and they come:
   If not,--myself were like enough, O girls,
   To unfurl the maiden banner of our rights,
   And clad in iron burst the ranks of war,
   Or, falling, promartyr of our cause,
   Die:  yet I blame you not so much for fear:
   Six thousand years of fear have made you that
   From which I would redeem you:  but for those
   That stir this hubbub--you and you--I know
   Your faces there in the crowd--tomorrow morn
   We hold a great convention:  then shall they
   That love their voices more than duty, learn
   With whom they deal, dismissed in shame to live
   No wiser than their mothers, household stuff,
   Live chattels, mincers of each other's fame,
   Full of weak poison, turnspits for the clown,
   The drunkard's football, laughing-stocks of Time,
   Whose brains are in their hands and in their heels
   But fit to flaunt, to dress, to dance, to thrum,
   To tramp, to scream, to burnish, and to scour,
   For ever slaves at home and fools abroad.'

        She, ending, waved her hands:  thereat the crowd
   Muttering, dissolved:  then with a smile, that looked
   A stroke of cruel sunshine on the cliff,
   When all the glens are drowned in azure gloom
   Of thunder-shower, she floated to us and said:

        'You have done well and like a gentleman,
   And like a prince:  you have our thanks for all:
   And you look well too in your woman's dress:
   Well have you done and like a gentleman.
   You saved our life:  we owe you bitter thanks:
   Better have died and spilt our bones in the flood--
   Then men had said--but now--What hinders me
   To take such bloody vengeance on you both?--
   Yet since our father--Wasps in our good hive,
   You would-be quenchers of the light to be,
   Barbarians, grosser than your native bears--
   O would I had his sceptre for one hour!
   You that have dared to break our bound, and gulled
   Our servants, wronged and lied and thwarted us--
   _I_ wed with thee!  _I_ bound by precontract
   Your bride, our bondslave! not though all the gold
   That veins the world were packed to make your crown,
   And every spoken tongue should lord you.  Sir,
   Your falsehood and yourself are hateful to us:
   I trample on your offers and on you:
   Begone:  we will not look upon you more.
   Here, push them out at gates.'
                                 In wrath she spake.
   Then those eight mighty daughters of the plough
   Bent their broad faces toward us and addressed
   Their motion:  twice I sought to plead my cause,
   But on my shoulder hung their heavy hands,
   The weight of destiny:  so from her face
   They pushed us, down the steps, and through the court,
   And with grim laughter thrust us out at gates.

        We crossed the street and gained a petty mound
   Beyond it, whence we saw the lights and heard the voices murmuring.
   While I listened, came
   On a sudden the weird seizure and the doubt:
   I seemed to move among a world of ghosts;
   The Princess with her monstrous woman-guard,
   The jest and earnest working side by side,
   The cataract and the tumult and the kings
   Were shadows; and the long fantastic night
   With all its doings had and had not been,
   And all things were and were not.
                                    This went by
   As strangely as it came, and on my spirits
   Settled a gentle cloud of melancholy;
   Not long; I shook it off; for spite of doubts
   And sudden ghostly shadowings I was one
   To whom the touch of all mischance but came
   As night to him that sitting on a hill
   Sees the midsummer, midnight, Norway sun
   Set into sunrise; then we moved away.


   Thy voice is heard through rolling drums,
      That beat to battle where he stands;
   Thy face across his fancy comes,
      And gives the battle to his hands:
   A moment, while the trumpets blow,
      He sees his brood about thy knee;
   The next, like fire he meets the foe,
      And strikes him dead for thine and thee.


   So Lilia sang:  we thought her half-possessed,
   She struck such warbling fury through the words;
   And, after, feigning pique at what she called
   The raillery, or grotesque, or false sublime--
   Like one that wishes at a dance to change
   The music--clapt her hands and cried for war,
   Or some grand fight to kill and make an end:
   And he that next inherited the tale
   Half turning to the broken statue, said,
   'Sir Ralph has got your colours:  if I prove
   Your knight, and fight your battle, what for me?'
   It chanced, her empty glove upon the tomb
   Lay by her like a model of her hand.
   She took it and she flung it.  'Fight' she said,
   'And make us all we would be, great and good.'
   He knightlike in his cap instead of casque,
   A cap of Tyrol borrowed from the hall,
   Arranged the favour, and assumed the Prince.




V



   Now, scarce three paces measured from the mound,
   We stumbled on a stationary voice,
   And 'Stand, who goes?'  'Two from the palace' I.
   'The second two:  they wait,' he said, 'pass on;
   His Highness wakes:' and one, that clashed in arms,
   By glimmering lanes and walls of canvas led
   Threading the soldier-city, till we heard
   The drowsy folds of our great ensign shake
   From blazoned lions o'er the imperial tent
   Whispers of war.
                   Entering, the sudden light
   Dazed me half-blind:  I stood and seemed to hear,
   As in a poplar grove when a light wind wakes
   A lisping of the innumerous leaf and dies,
   Each hissing in his neighbour's ear; and then
   A strangled titter, out of which there brake
   On all sides, clamouring etiquette to death,
   Unmeasured mirth; while now the two old kings
   Began to wag their baldness up and down,
   The fresh young captains flashed their glittering teeth,
   The huge bush-bearded Barons heaved and blew,
   And slain with laughter rolled the gilded Squire.

        At length my Sire, his rough cheek wet with tears,
   Panted from weary sides 'King, you are free!
   We did but keep you surety for our son,
   If this be he,--or a dragged mawkin, thou,
   That tends to her bristled grunters in the sludge:'
   For I was drenched with ooze, and torn with briers,
   More crumpled than a poppy from the sheath,
   And all one rag, disprinced from head to heel.
   Then some one sent beneath his vaulted palm
   A whispered jest to some one near him, 'Look,
   He has been among his shadows.'  'Satan take
   The old women and their shadows! (thus the King
   Roared) make yourself a man to fight with men.
   Go:  Cyril told us all.'
                           As boys that slink
   From ferule and the trespass-chiding eye,
   Away we stole, and transient in a trice
   From what was left of faded woman-slough
   To sheathing splendours and the golden scale
   Of harness, issued in the sun, that now
   Leapt from the dewy shoulders of the Earth,
   And hit the Northern hills.  Here Cyril met us.
   A little shy at first, but by and by
   We twain, with mutual pardon asked and given
   For stroke and song, resoldered peace, whereon
   Followed his tale.  Amazed he fled away
   Through the dark land, and later in the night
   Had come on Psyche weeping:  'then we fell
   Into your father's hand, and there she lies,
   But will not speak, or stir.'
                                He showed a tent
   A stone-shot off:  we entered in, and there
   Among piled arms and rough accoutrements,
   Pitiful sight, wrapped in a soldier's cloak,
   Like some sweet sculpture draped from head to foot,
   And pushed by rude hands from its pedestal,
   All her fair length upon the ground she lay:
   And at her head a follower of the camp,
   A charred and wrinkled piece of womanhood,
   Sat watching like the watcher by the dead.

        Then Florian knelt, and 'Come' he whispered to her,
   'Lift up your head, sweet sister:  lie not thus.
   What have you done but right? you could not slay
   Me, nor your prince:  look up:  be comforted:
   Sweet is it to have done the thing one ought,
   When fallen in darker ways.'  And likewise I:
   'Be comforted:  have I not lost her too,
   In whose least act abides the nameless charm
   That none has else for me?'  She heard, she moved,
   She moaned, a folded voice; and up she sat,
   And raised the cloak from brows as pale and smooth
   As those that mourn half-shrouded over death
   In deathless marble.  'Her,' she said, 'my friend--
   Parted from her--betrayed her cause and mine--
   Where shall I breathe? why kept ye not your faith?
   O base and bad! what comfort? none for me!'
   To whom remorseful Cyril, 'Yet I pray
   Take comfort:  live, dear lady, for your child!'
   At which she lifted up her voice and cried.

        'Ah me, my babe, my blossom, ah, my child,
   My one sweet child, whom I shall see no more!
   For now will cruel Ida keep her back;
   And either she will die from want of care,
   Or sicken with ill-usage, when they say
   The child is hers--for every little fault,
   The child is hers; and they will beat my girl
   Remembering her mother:  O my flower!
   Or they will take her, they will make her hard,
   And she will pass me by in after-life
   With some cold reverence worse than were she dead.
   Ill mother that I was to leave her there,
   To lag behind, scared by the cry they made,
   The horror of the shame among them all:
   But I will go and sit beside the doors,
   And make a wild petition night and day,
   Until they hate to hear me like a wind
   Wailing for ever, till they open to me,
   And lay my little blossom at my feet,
   My babe, my sweet Aglaia, my one child:
   And I will take her up and go my way,
   And satisfy my soul with kissing her:
   Ah! what might that man not deserve of me
   Who gave me back my child?'  'Be comforted,'
   Said Cyril, 'you shall have it:' but again
   She veiled her brows, and prone she sank, and so
   Like tender things that being caught feign death,
   Spoke not, nor stirred.
                          By this a murmur ran
   Through all the camp and inward raced the scouts
   With rumour of Prince Arab hard at hand.
   We left her by the woman, and without
   Found the gray kings at parle:  and 'Look you' cried
   My father 'that our compact be fulfilled:
   You have spoilt this child; she laughs at you and man:
   She wrongs herself, her sex, and me, and him:
   But red-faced war has rods of steel and fire;
   She yields, or war.'
                       Then Gama turned to me:
   'We fear, indeed, you spent a stormy time
   With our strange girl:  and yet they say that still
   You love her.  Give us, then, your mind at large:
   How say you, war or not?'
                            'Not war, if possible,
   O king,' I said, 'lest from the abuse of war,
   The desecrated shrine, the trampled year,
   The smouldering homestead, and the household flower
   Torn from the lintel--all the common wrong--
   A smoke go up through which I loom to her
   Three times a monster:  now she lightens scorn
   At him that mars her plan, but then would hate
   (And every voice she talked with ratify it,
   And every face she looked on justify it)
   The general foe.  More soluble is this knot,
   By gentleness than war.  I want her love.
   What were I nigher this although we dashed
   Your cities into shards with catapults,
   She would not love;--or brought her chained, a slave,
   The lifting of whose eyelash is my lord,
   Not ever would she love; but brooding turn
   The book of scorn, till all my flitting chance
   Were caught within the record of her wrongs,
   And crushed to death:  and rather, Sire, than this
   I would the old God of war himself were dead,
   Forgotten, rusting on his iron hills,
   Rotting on some wild shore with ribs of wreck,
   Or like an old-world mammoth bulked in ice,
   Not to be molten out.'
                         And roughly spake
   My father, 'Tut, you know them not, the girls.
   Boy, when I hear you prate I almost think
   That idiot legend credible.  Look you, Sir!
   Man is the hunter; woman is his game:
   The sleek and shining creatures of the chase,
   We hunt them for the beauty of their skins;
   They love us for it, and we ride them down.
   Wheedling and siding with them!  Out! for shame!
   Boy, there's no rose that's half so dear to them
   As he that does the thing they dare not do,
   Breathing and sounding beauteous battle, comes
   With the air of the trumpet round him, and leaps in
   Among the women, snares them by the score
   Flattered and flustered, wins, though dashed with death
   He reddens what he kisses:  thus I won
   You mother, a good mother, a good wife,
   Worth winning; but this firebrand--gentleness
   To such as her! if Cyril spake her true,
   To catch a dragon in a cherry net,
   To trip a tigress with a gossamer
   Were wisdom to it.'
                      'Yea but Sire,' I cried,
   'Wild natures need wise curbs.  The soldier?  No:
   What dares not Ida do that she should prize
   The soldier?  I beheld her, when she rose
   The yesternight, and storming in extremes,
   Stood for her cause, and flung defiance down
   Gagelike to man, and had not shunned the death,
   No, not the soldier's:  yet I hold her, king,
   True woman:  you clash them all in one,
   That have as many differences as we.
   The violet varies from the lily as far
   As oak from elm:  one loves the soldier, one
   The silken priest of peace, one this, one that,
   And some unworthily; their sinless faith,
   A maiden moon that sparkles on a sty,
   Glorifying clown and satyr; whence they need
   More breadth of culture:  is not Ida right?
   They worth it? truer to the law within?
   Severer in the logic of a life?
   Twice as magnetic to sweet influences
   Of earth and heaven? and she of whom you speak,
   My mother, looks as whole as some serene
   Creation minted in the golden moods
   Of sovereign artists; not a thought, a touch,
   But pure as lines of green that streak the white
   Of the first snowdrop's inner leaves; I say,
   Not like the piebald miscellany, man,
   Bursts of great heart and slips in sensual mire,
   But whole and one:  and take them all-in-all,
   Were we ourselves but half as good, as kind,
   As truthful, much that Ida claims as right
   Had ne'er been mooted, but as frankly theirs
   As dues of Nature.  To our point:  not war:
   Lest I lose all.'
                    'Nay, nay, you spake but sense'
   Said Gama.  'We remember love ourself
   In our sweet youth; we did not rate him then
   This red-hot iron to be shaped with blows.
   You talk almost like Ida:  _she_ can talk;
   And there is something in it as you say:
   But you talk kindlier:  we esteem you for it.--
   He seems a gracious and a gallant Prince,
   I would he had our daughter:  for the rest,
   Our own detention, why, the causes weighed,
   Fatherly fears--you used us courteously--
   We would do much to gratify your Prince--
   We pardon it; and for your ingress here
   Upon the skirt and fringe of our fair land,
   you did but come as goblins in the night,
   Nor in the furrow broke the ploughman's head,
   Nor burnt the grange, nor bussed the milking-maid,
   Nor robbed the farmer of his bowl of cream:
   But let your Prince (our royal word upon it,
   He comes back safe) ride with us to our lines,
   And speak with Arac:  Arac's word is thrice
   As ours with Ida:  something may be done--
   I know not what--and ours shall see us friends.
   You, likewise, our late guests, if so you will,
   Follow us:  who knows? we four may build some plan
   Foursquare to opposition.'
                             Here he reached
   White hands of farewell to my sire, who growled
   An answer which, half-muffled in his beard,
   Let so much out as gave us leave to go.

        Then rode we with the old king across the lawns
   Beneath huge trees, a thousand rings of Spring
   In every bole, a song on every spray
   Of birds that piped their Valentines, and woke
   Desire in me to infuse my tale of love
   In the old king's ears, who promised help, and oozed
   All o'er with honeyed answer as we rode
   And blossom-fragrant slipt the heavy dews
   Gathered by night and peace, with each light air
   On our mailed heads:  but other thoughts than Peace
   Burnt in us, when we saw the embattled squares,
   And squadrons of the Prince, trampling the flowers
   With clamour:  for among them rose a cry
   As if to greet the king; they made a halt;
   The horses yelled; they clashed their arms; the drum
   Beat; merrily-blowing shrilled the martial fife;
   And in the blast and bray of the long horn
   And serpent-throated bugle, undulated
   The banner:  anon to meet us lightly pranced
   Three captains out; nor ever had I seen
   Such thews of men:  the midmost and the highest
   Was Arac:  all about his motion clung
   The shadow of his sister, as the beam
   Of the East, that played upon them, made them glance
   Like those three stars of the airy Giant's zone,
   That glitter burnished by the frosty dark;
   And as the fiery Sirius alters hue,
   And bickers into red and emerald, shone
   Their morions, washed with morning, as they came.

        And I that prated peace, when first I heard
   War-music, felt the blind wildbeast of force,
   Whose home is in the sinews of a man,
   Stir in me as to strike:  then took the king
   His three broad sons; with now a wandering hand
   And now a pointed finger, told them all:
   A common light of smiles at our disguise
   Broke from their lips, and, ere the windy jest
   Had laboured down within his ample lungs,
   The genial giant, Arac, rolled himself
   Thrice in the saddle, then burst out in words.

        'Our land invaded, 'sdeath! and he himself
   Your captive, yet my father wills not war:
   And, 'sdeath! myself, what care I, war or no?
   but then this question of your troth remains:
   And there's a downright honest meaning in her;
   She flies too high, she flies too high! and yet
   She asked but space and fairplay for her scheme;
   She prest and prest it on me--I myself,
   What know I of these things? but, life and soul!
   I thought her half-right talking of her wrongs;
   I say she flies too high, 'sdeath! what of that?
   I take her for the flower of womankind,
   And so I often told her, right or wrong,
   And, Prince, she can be sweet to those she loves,
   And, right or wrong, I care not:  this is all,
   I stand upon her side:  she made me swear it--
   'Sdeath--and with solemn rites by candle-light--
   Swear by St something--I forget her name--
   Her that talked down the fifty wisest men;
   _She_ was a princess too; and so I swore.
   Come, this is all; she will not:  waive your claim:
   If not, the foughten field, what else, at once
   Decides it, 'sdeath! against my father's will.'

        I lagged in answer loth to render up
   My precontract, and loth by brainless war
   To cleave the rift of difference deeper yet;
   Till one of those two brothers, half aside
   And fingering at the hair about his lip,
   To prick us on to combat 'Like to like!
   The woman's garment hid the woman's heart.'
   A taunt that clenched his purpose like a blow!
   For fiery-short was Cyril's counter-scoff,
   And sharp I answered, touched upon the point
   Where idle boys are cowards to their shame,
   'Decide it here:  why not? we are three to three.'

        Then spake the third 'But three to three? no more?
   No more, and in our noble sister's cause?
   More, more, for honour:  every captain waits
   Hungry for honour, angry for his king.
   More, more some fifty on a side, that each
   May breathe himself, and quick! by overthrow
   Of these or those, the question settled die.'

        'Yea,' answered I, 'for this wreath of air,
   This flake of rainbow flying on the highest
   Foam of men's deeds--this honour, if ye will.
   It needs must be for honour if at all:
   Since, what decision? if we fail, we fail,
   And if we win, we fail:  she would not keep
   Her compact.'  ''Sdeath! but we will send to her,'
   Said Arac, 'worthy reasons why she should
   Bide by this issue:  let our missive through,
   And you shall have her answer by the word.'

        'Boys!' shrieked the old king, but vainlier than a hen
   To her false daughters in the pool; for none
   Regarded; neither seemed there more to say:
   Back rode we to my father's camp, and found
   He thrice had sent a herald to the gates,
   To learn if Ida yet would cede our claim,
   Or by denial flush her babbling wells
   With her own people's life:  three times he went:
   The first, he blew and blew, but none appeared:
   He battered at the doors; none came:  the next,
   An awful voice within had warned him thence:
   The third, and those eight daughters of the plough
   Came sallying through the gates, and caught his hair,
   And so belaboured him on rib and cheek
   They made him wild:  not less one glance he caught
   Through open doors of Ida stationed there
   Unshaken, clinging to her purpose, firm
   Though compassed by two armies and the noise
   Of arms; and standing like a stately Pine
   Set in a cataract on an island-crag,
   When storm is on the heights, and right and left
   Sucked from the dark heart of the long hills roll
   The torrents, dashed to the vale:  and yet her will
   Bred will in me to overcome it or fall.

        But when I told the king that I was pledged
   To fight in tourney for my bride, he clashed
   His iron palms together with a cry;
   Himself would tilt it out among the lads:
   But overborne by all his bearded lords
   With reasons drawn from age and state, perforce
   He yielded, wroth and red, with fierce demur:
   And many a bold knight started up in heat,
   And sware to combat for my claim till death.

        All on this side the palace ran the field
   Flat to the garden-wall:  and likewise here,
   Above the garden's glowing blossom-belts,
   A columned entry shone and marble stairs,
   And great bronze valves, embossed with Tomyris
   And what she did to Cyrus after fight,
   But now fast barred:  so here upon the flat
   All that long morn the lists were hammered up,
   And all that morn the heralds to and fro,
   With message and defiance, went and came;
   Last, Ida's answer, in a royal hand,
   But shaken here and there, and rolling words
   Oration-like.  I kissed it and I read.

        'O brother, you have known the pangs we felt,
   What heats of indignation when we heard
   Of those that iron-cramped their women's feet;
   Of lands in which at the altar the poor bride
   Gives her harsh groom for bridal-gift a scourge;
   Of living hearts that crack within the fire
   Where smoulder their dead despots; and of those,--
   Mothers,--that, with all prophetic pity, fling
   Their pretty maids in the running flood, and swoops
   The vulture, beak and talon, at the heart
   Made for all noble motion:  and I saw
   That equal baseness lived in sleeker times
   With smoother men:  the old leaven leavened all:
   Millions of throats would bawl for civil rights,
   No woman named:  therefore I set my face
   Against all men, and lived but for mine own.
   Far off from men I built a fold for them:
   I stored it full of rich memorial:
   I fenced it round with gallant institutes,
   And biting laws to scare the beasts of prey
   And prospered; till a rout of saucy boys
   Brake on us at our books, and marred our peace,
   Masked like our maids, blustering I know not what
   Of insolence and love, some pretext held
   Of baby troth, invalid, since my will
   Sealed not the bond--the striplings! for their sport!--
   I tamed my leopards:  shall I not tame these?
   Or you? or I? for since you think me touched
   In honour--what, I would not aught of false--
   Is not our case pure? and whereas I know
   Your prowess, Arac, and what mother's blood
   You draw from, fight; you failing, I abide
   What end soever:  fail you will not.  Still
   Take not his life:  he risked it for my own;
   His mother lives:  yet whatsoe'er you do,
   Fight and fight well; strike and strike him.  O dear
   Brothers, the woman's Angel guards you, you
   The sole men to be mingled with our cause,
   The sole men we shall prize in the after-time,
   Your very armour hallowed, and your statues
   Reared, sung to, when, this gad-fly brushed aside,
   We plant a solid foot into the Time,
   And mould a generation strong to move
   With claim on claim from right to right, till she
   Whose name is yoked with children's, know herself;
   And Knowledge in our own land make her free,
   And, ever following those two crowned twins,
   Commerce and conquest, shower the fiery grain
   Of freedom broadcast over all the orbs
   Between the Northern and the Southern morn.'

        Then came a postscript dashed across the rest.
   See that there be no traitors in your camp:
   We seem a nest of traitors--none to trust
   Since our arms failed--this Egypt-plague of men!
   Almost our maids were better at their homes,
   Than thus man-girdled here:  indeed I think
   Our chiefest comfort is the little child
   Of one unworthy mother; which she left:
   She shall not have it back:  the child shall grow
   To prize the authentic mother of her mind.
   I took it for an hour in mine own bed
   This morning:  there the tender orphan hands
   Felt at my heart, and seemed to charm from thence
   The wrath I nursed against the world:  farewell.'

        I ceased; he said, 'Stubborn, but she may sit
   Upon a king's right hand in thunder-storms,
   And breed up warriors!  See now, though yourself
   Be dazzled by the wildfire Love to sloughs
   That swallow common sense, the spindling king,
   This Gama swamped in lazy tolerance.
   When the man wants weight, the woman takes it up,
   And topples down the scales; but this is fixt
   As are the roots of earth and base of all;
   Man for the field and woman for the hearth:
   Man for the sword and for the needle she:
   Man with the head and woman with the heart:
   Man to command and woman to obey;
   All else confusion.  Look you! the gray mare
   Is ill to live with, when her whinny shrills
   From tile to scullery, and her small goodman
   Shrinks in his arm-chair while the fires of Hell
   Mix with his hearth:  but you--she's yet a colt--
   Take, break her:  strongly groomed and straitly curbed
   She might not rank with those detestable
   That let the bantling scald at home, and brawl
   Their rights and wrongs like potherbs in the street.
   They say she's comely; there's the fairer chance:
   _I_ like her none the less for rating at her!
   Besides, the woman wed is not as we,
   But suffers change of frame.  A lusty brace
   Of twins may weed her of her folly.  Boy,
   The bearing and the training of a child
   Is woman's wisdom.'
                      Thus the hard old king:
   I took my leave, for it was nearly noon:
   I pored upon her letter which I held,
   And on the little clause 'take not his life:'
   I mused on that wild morning in the woods,
   And on the 'Follow, follow, thou shalt win:'
   I thought on all the wrathful king had said,
   And how the strange betrothment was to end:
   Then I remembered that burnt sorcerer's curse
   That one should fight with shadows and should fall;
   And like a flash the weird affection came:
   King, camp and college turned to hollow shows;
   I seemed to move in old memorial tilts,
   And doing battle with forgotten ghosts,
   To dream myself the shadow of a dream:
   And ere I woke it was the point of noon,
   The lists were ready.  Empanoplied and plumed
   We entered in, and waited, fifty there
   Opposed to fifty, till the trumpet blared
   At the barrier like a wild horn in a land
   Of echoes, and a moment, and once more
   The trumpet, and again:  at which the storm
   Of galloping hoofs bare on the ridge of spears
   And riders front to front, until they closed
   In conflict with the crash of shivering points,
   And thunder.  Yet it seemed a dream, I dreamed
   Of fighting.  On his haunches rose the steed,
   And into fiery splinters leapt the lance,
   And out of stricken helmets sprang the fire.
   Part sat like rocks:  part reeled but kept their seats:
   Part rolled on the earth and rose again and drew:
   Part stumbled mixt with floundering horses.  Down
   From those two bulks at Arac's side, and down
   From Arac's arm, as from a giant's flail,
   The large blows rained, as here and everywhere
   He rode the mellay, lord of the ringing lists,
   And all the plain,--brand, mace, and shaft, and shield--
   Shocked, like an iron-clanging anvil banged
   With hammers; till I thought, can this be he
   From Gama's dwarfish loins? if this be so,
   The mother makes us most--and in my dream
   I glanced aside, and saw the palace-front
   Alive with fluttering scarfs and ladies' eyes,
   And highest, among the statues, statuelike,
   Between a cymballed Miriam and a Jael,
   With Psyche's babe, was Ida watching us,
   A single band of gold about her hair,
   Like a Saint's glory up in heaven:  but she
   No saint--inexorable--no tenderness--
   Too hard, too cruel:  yet she sees me fight,
   Yea, let her see me fall! and with that I drave
   Among the thickest and bore down a Prince,
   And Cyril, one.  Yea, let me make my dream
   All that I would.  But that large-moulded man,
   His visage all agrin as at a wake,
   Made at me through the press, and, staggering back
   With stroke on stroke the horse and horseman, came
   As comes a pillar of electric cloud,
   Flaying the roofs and sucking up the drains,
   And shadowing down the champaign till it strikes
   On a wood, and takes, and breaks, and cracks, and splits,
   And twists the grain with such a roar that Earth
   Reels, and the herdsmen cry; for everything
   Game way before him:  only Florian, he
   That loved me closer than his own right eye,
   Thrust in between; but Arac rode him down:
   And Cyril seeing it, pushed against the Prince,
   With Psyche's colour round his helmet, tough,
   Strong, supple, sinew-corded, apt at arms;
   But tougher, heavier, stronger, he that smote
   And threw him:  last I spurred; I felt my veins
   Stretch with fierce heat; a moment hand to hand,
   And sword to sword, and horse to horse we hung,
   Till I struck out and shouted; the blade glanced,
   I did but shear a feather, and dream and truth
   Flowed from me; darkness closed me; and I fell.


   Home they brought her warrior dead:
      She nor swooned, nor uttered cry:
   All her maidens, watching, said,
      'She must weep or she will die.'

   Then they praised him, soft and low,
      Called him worthy to be loved,
   Truest friend and noblest foe;
      Yet she neither spoke nor moved.

   Stole a maiden from her place,
      Lightly to the warrior stept,
   Took the face-cloth from the face;
      Yet she neither moved nor wept.

   Rose a nurse of ninety years,
      Set his child upon her knee--
   Like summer tempest came her tears--
      'Sweet my child, I live for thee.'




VI



   My dream had never died or lived again.
   As in some mystic middle state I lay;
   Seeing I saw not, hearing not I heard:
   Though, if I saw not, yet they told me all
   So often that I speak as having seen.

        For so it seemed, or so they said to me,
   That all things grew more tragic and more strange;
   That when our side was vanquished and my cause
   For ever lost, there went up a great cry,
   The Prince is slain.  My father heard and ran
   In on the lists, and there unlaced my casque
   And grovelled on my body, and after him
   Came Psyche, sorrowing for Aglaia.
        But high upon the palace Ida stood
   With Psyche's babe in arm:  there on the roofs
   Like that great dame of Lapidoth she sang.


      'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen:  the seed,
   The little seed they laughed at in the dark,
   Has risen and cleft the soil, and grown a bulk
   Of spanless girth, that lays on every side
   A thousand arms and rushes to the Sun.

      'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen:  they came;
   The leaves were wet with women's tears:  they heard
   A noise of songs they would not understand:
   They marked it with the red cross to the fall,
   And would have strown it, and are fallen themselves.

      'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen:  they came,
   The woodmen with their axes:  lo the tree!
   But we will make it faggots for the hearth,
   And shape it plank and beam for roof and floor,
   And boats and bridges for the use of men.

      'Our enemies have fallen, have fallen:  they struck;
   With their own blows they hurt themselves, nor knew
   There dwelt an iron nature in the grain:
   The glittering axe was broken in their arms,
   Their arms were shattered to the shoulder blade.

      'Our enemies have fallen, but this shall grow
   A night of Summer from the heat, a breadth
   Of Autumn, dropping fruits of power:  and rolled
   With music in the growing breeze of Time,
   The tops shall strike from star to star, the fangs
   Shall move the stony bases of the world.

        'And now, O maids, behold our sanctuary
   Is violate, our laws broken:  fear we not
   To break them more in their behoof, whose arms
   Championed our cause and won it with a day
   Blanched in our annals, and perpetual feast,
   When dames and heroines of the golden year
   Shall strip a hundred hollows bare of Spring,
   To rain an April of ovation round
   Their statues, borne aloft, the three:  but come,
   We will be liberal, since our rights are won.
   Let them not lie in the tents with coarse mankind,
   Ill nurses; but descend, and proffer these
   The brethren of our blood and cause, that there
   Lie bruised and maimed, the tender ministries
   Of female hands and hospitality.'

        She spoke, and with the babe yet in her arms,
   Descending, burst the great bronze valves, and led
   A hundred maids in train across the Park.
   Some cowled, and some bare-headed, on they came,
   Their feet in flowers, her loveliest:  by them went
   The enamoured air sighing, and on their curls
   From the high tree the blossom wavering fell,
   And over them the tremulous isles of light
   Slided, they moving under shade:  but Blanche
   At distance followed:  so they came:  anon
   Through open field into the lists they wound
   Timorously; and as the leader of the herd
   That holds a stately fretwork to the Sun,
   And followed up by a hundred airy does,
   Steps with a tender foot, light as on air,
   The lovely, lordly creature floated on
   To where her wounded brethren lay; there stayed;
   Knelt on one knee,--the child on one,--and prest
   Their hands, and called them dear deliverers,
   And happy warriors, and immortal names,
   And said 'You shall not lie in the tents but here,
   And nursed by those for whom you fought, and served
   With female hands and hospitality.'

        Then, whether moved by this, or was it chance,
   She past my way.  Up started from my side
   The old lion, glaring with his whelpless eye,
   Silent; but when she saw me lying stark,
   Dishelmed and mute, and motionlessly pale,
   Cold even to her, she sighed; and when she saw
   The haggard father's face and reverend beard
   Of grisly twine, all dabbled with the blood
   Of his own son, shuddered, a twitch of pain
   Tortured her mouth, and o'er her forehead past
   A shadow, and her hue changed, and she said:
   'He saved my life:  my brother slew him for it.'
   No more:  at which the king in bitter scorn
   Drew from my neck the painting and the tress,
   And held them up:  she saw them, and a day
   Rose from the distance on her memory,
   When the good Queen, her mother, shore the tress
   With kisses, ere the days of Lady Blanche:
   And then once more she looked at my pale face:
   Till understanding all the foolish work
   Of Fancy, and the bitter close of all,
   Her iron will was broken in her mind;
   Her noble heart was molten in her breast;
   She bowed, she set the child on the earth; she laid
   A feeling finger on my brows, and presently
   'O Sire,' she said, 'he lives:  he is not dead:
   O let me have him with my brethren here
   In our own palace:  we will tend on him
   Like one of these; if so, by any means,
   To lighten this great clog of thanks, that make
   Our progress falter to the woman's goal.'

        She said:  but at the happy word 'he lives'
   My father stooped, re-fathered o'er my wounds.
   So those two foes above my fallen life,
   With brow to brow like night and evening mixt
   Their dark and gray, while Psyche ever stole
   A little nearer, till the babe that by us,
   Half-lapt in glowing gauze and golden brede,
   Lay like a new-fallen meteor on the grass,
   Uncared for, spied its mother and began
   A blind and babbling laughter, and to dance
   Its body, and reach its fatling innocent arms
   And lazy lingering fingers.  She the appeal
   Brooked not, but clamouring out 'Mine--mine--not yours,
   It is not yours, but mine:  give me the child'
   Ceased all on tremble:  piteous was the cry:
   So stood the unhappy mother open-mouthed,
   And turned each face her way:  wan was her cheek
   With hollow watch, her blooming mantle torn,
   Red grief and mother's hunger in her eye,
   And down dead-heavy sank her curls, and half
   The sacred mother's bosom, panting, burst
   The laces toward her babe; but she nor cared
   Nor knew it, clamouring on, till Ida heard,
   Looked up, and rising slowly from me, stood
   Erect and silent, striking with her glance
   The mother, me, the child; but he that lay
   Beside us, Cyril, battered as he was,
   Trailed himself up on one knee:  then he drew
   Her robe to meet his lips, and down she looked
   At the armed man sideways, pitying as it seemed,
   Or self-involved; but when she learnt his face,
   Remembering his ill-omened song, arose
   Once more through all her height, and o'er him grew
   Tall as a figure lengthened on the sand
   When the tide ebbs in sunshine, and he said:

        'O fair and strong and terrible!  Lioness
   That with your long locks play the Lion's mane!
   But Love and Nature, these are two more terrible
   And stronger.  See, your foot is on our necks,
   We vanquished, you the Victor of your will.
   What would you more? Give her the child! remain
   Orbed in your isolation:  he is dead,
   Or all as dead:  henceforth we let you be:
   Win you the hearts of women; and beware
   Lest, where you seek the common love of these,
   The common hate with the revolving wheel
   Should drag you down, and some great Nemesis
   Break from a darkened future, crowned with fire,
   And tread you out for ever:  but howso'er
   Fixed in yourself, never in your own arms
   To hold your own, deny not hers to her,
   Give her the child!  O if, I say, you keep
   One pulse that beats true woman, if you loved
   The breast that fed or arm that dandled you,
   Or own one port of sense not flint to prayer,
   Give her the child! or if you scorn to lay it,
   Yourself, in hands so lately claspt with yours,
   Or speak to her, your dearest, her one fault,
   The tenderness, not yours, that could not kill,
   Give _me_ it:  _I_ will give it her.
                                   He said:
   At first her eye with slow dilation rolled
   Dry flame, she listening; after sank and sank
   And, into mournful twilight mellowing, dwelt
   Full on the child; she took it:  'Pretty bud!
   Lily of the vale! half opened bell of the woods!
   Sole comfort of my dark hour, when a world
   Of traitorous friend and broken system made
   No purple in the distance, mystery,
   Pledge of a love not to be mine, farewell;
   These men are hard upon us as of old,
   We two must part:  and yet how fain was I
   To dream thy cause embraced in mine, to think
   I might be something to thee, when I felt
   Thy helpless warmth about my barren breast
   In the dead prime:  but may thy mother prove
   As true to thee as false, false, false to me!
   And, if thou needs must needs bear the yoke, I wish it
   Gentle as freedom'--here she kissed it:  then--
   'All good go with thee! take it Sir,' and so
   Laid the soft babe in his hard-mailed hands,
   Who turned half-round to Psyche as she sprang
   To meet it, with an eye that swum in thanks;
   Then felt it sound and whole from head to foot,
   And hugged and never hugged it close enough,
   And in her hunger mouthed and mumbled it,
   And hid her bosom with it; after that
   Put on more calm and added suppliantly:

        'We two were friends:  I go to mine own land
   For ever:  find some other:  as for me
   I scarce am fit for your great plans:  yet speak to me,
   Say one soft word and let me part forgiven.'

        But Ida spoke not, rapt upon the child.
   Then Arac.  'Ida--'sdeath! you blame the man;
   You wrong yourselves--the woman is so hard
   Upon the woman.  Come, a grace to me!
   I am your warrior:  I and mine have fought
   Your battle:  kiss her; take her hand, she weeps:
   'Sdeath!  I would sooner fight thrice o'er than see it.'

        But Ida spoke not, gazing on the ground,
   And reddening in the furrows of his chin,
   And moved beyond his custom, Gama said:

        'I've heard that there is iron in the blood,
   And I believe it.  Not one word? not one?
   Whence drew you this steel temper? not from me,
   Not from your mother, now a saint with saints.
   She said you had a heart--I heard her say it--
   "Our Ida has a heart"--just ere she died--
   "But see that some on with authority
   Be near her still" and I--I sought for one--
   All people said she had authority--
   The Lady Blanche:  much profit!  Not one word;
   No! though your father sues:  see how you stand
   Stiff as Lot's wife, and all the good knights maimed,
   I trust that there is no one hurt to death,
   For our wild whim:  and was it then for this,
   Was it for this we gave our palace up,
   Where we withdrew from summer heats and state,
   And had our wine and chess beneath the planes,
   And many a pleasant hour with her that's gone,
   Ere you were born to vex us?  Is it kind?
   Speak to her I say:  is this not she of whom,
   When first she came, all flushed you said to me
   Now had you got a friend of your own age,
   Now could you share your thought; now should men see
   Two women faster welded in one love
   Than pairs of wedlock; she you walked with, she
   You talked with, whole nights long, up in the tower,
   Of sine and arc, spheroid and azimuth,
   And right ascension, Heaven knows what; and now
   A word, but one, one little kindly word,
   Not one to spare her:  out upon you, flint!
   You love nor her, nor me, nor any; nay,
   You shame your mother's judgment too.  Not one?
   You will not? well--no heart have you, or such
   As fancies like the vermin in a nut
   Have fretted all to dust and bitterness.'
   So said the small king moved beyond his wont.

        But Ida stood nor spoke, drained of her force
   By many a varying influence and so long.
   Down through her limbs a drooping languor wept:
   Her head a little bent; and on her mouth
   A doubtful smile dwelt like a clouded moon
   In a still water:  then brake out my sire,
   Lifted his grim head from my wounds.  'O you,
   Woman, whom we thought woman even now,
   And were half fooled to let you tend our son,
   Because he might have wished it--but we see,
   The accomplice of your madness unforgiven,
   And think that you might mix his draught with death,
   When your skies change again:  the rougher hand
   Is safer:  on to the tents:  take up the Prince.'

        He rose, and while each ear was pricked to attend
   A tempest, through the cloud that dimmed her broke
   A genial warmth and light once more, and shone
   Through glittering drops on her sad friend.
                                              'Come hither.
   O Psyche,' she cried out, 'embrace me, come,
   Quick while I melt; make reconcilement sure
   With one that cannot keep her mind an hour:
   Come to the hollow hear they slander so!
   Kiss and be friends, like children being chid!
   _I_ seem no more:  _I_ want forgiveness too:
   I should have had to do with none but maids,
   That have no links with men.  Ah false but dear,
   Dear traitor, too much loved, why?--why?--Yet see,
   Before these kings we embrace you yet once more
   With all forgiveness, all oblivion,
   And trust, not love, you less.
                                 And now, O sire,
   Grant me your son, to nurse, to wait upon him,
   Like mine own brother.  For my debt to him,
   This nightmare weight of gratitude, I know it;
   Taunt me no more:  yourself and yours shall have
   Free adit; we will scatter all our maids
   Till happier times each to her proper hearth:
   What use to keep them here--now? grant my prayer.
   Help, father, brother, help; speak to the king:
   Thaw this male nature to some touch of that
   Which kills me with myself, and drags me down
   From my fixt height to mob me up with all
   The soft and milky rabble of womankind,
   Poor weakling even as they are.'
                                   Passionate tears
   Followed:  the king replied not:  Cyril said:
   'Your brother, Lady,--Florian,--ask for him
   Of your great head--for he is wounded too--
   That you may tend upon him with the prince.'
   'Ay so,' said Ida with a bitter smile,
   'Our laws are broken:  let him enter too.'
   Then Violet, she that sang the mournful song,
   And had a cousin tumbled on the plain,
   Petitioned too for him.  'Ay so,' she said,
   'I stagger in the stream:  I cannot keep
   My heart an eddy from the brawling hour:
   We break our laws with ease, but let it be.'
   'Ay so?' said Blanche:  'Amazed am I to her
   Your Highness:  but your Highness breaks with ease
   The law your Highness did not make:  'twas I.
   I had been wedded wife, I knew mankind,
   And blocked them out; but these men came to woo
   Your Highness--verily I think to win.'

        So she, and turned askance a wintry eye:
   But Ida with a voice, that like a bell
   Tolled by an earthquake in a trembling tower,
   Rang ruin, answered full of grief and scorn.

        'Fling our doors wide! all, all, not one, but all,
   Not only he, but by my mother's soul,
   Whatever man lies wounded, friend or foe,
   Shall enter, if he will.  Let our girls flit,
   Till the storm die! but had you stood by us,
   The roar that breaks the Pharos from his base
   Had left us rock.  She fain would sting us too,
   But shall not.  Pass, and mingle with your likes.
   We brook no further insult but are gone.'
        She turned; the very nape of her white neck
   Was rosed with indignation:  but the Prince
   Her brother came; the king her father charmed
   Her wounded soul with words:  nor did mine own
   Refuse her proffer, lastly gave his hand.

        Then us they lifted up, dead weights, and bare
   Straight to the doors:  to them the doors gave way
   Groaning, and in the Vestal entry shrieked
   The virgin marble under iron heels:
   And on they moved and gained the hall, and there
   Rested:  but great the crush was, and each base,
   To left and right, of those tall columns drowned
   In silken fluctuation and the swarm
   Of female whisperers:  at the further end
   Was Ida by the throne, the two great cats
   Close by her, like supporters on a shield,
   Bow-backed with fear:  but in the centre stood
   The common men with rolling eyes; amazed
   They glared upon the women, and aghast
   The women stared at these, all silent, save
   When armour clashed or jingled, while the day,
   Descending, struck athwart the hall, and shot
   A flying splendour out of brass and steel,
   That o'er the statues leapt from head to head,
   Now fired an angry Pallas on the helm,
   Now set a wrathful Dian's moon on flame,
   And now and then an echo started up,
   And shuddering fled from room to room, and died
   Of fright in far apartments.
                               Then the voice
   Of Ida sounded, issuing ordinance:
   And me they bore up the broad stairs, and through
   The long-laid galleries past a hundred doors
   To one deep chamber shut from sound, and due
   To languid limbs and sickness; left me in it;
   And others otherwhere they laid; and all
   That afternoon a sound arose of hoof
   And chariot, many a maiden passing home
   Till happier times; but some were left of those
   Held sagest, and the great lords out and in,
   From those two hosts that lay beside the walls,
   Walked at their will, and everything was changed.


   Ask me no more:  the moon may draw the sea;
      The cloud may stoop from heaven and take the shape
      With fold to fold, of mountain or of cape;
   But O too fond, when have I answered thee?
                          Ask me no more.

   Ask me no more:  what answer should I give?
      I love not hollow cheek or faded eye:
      Yet, O my friend, I will not have thee die!
   Ask me no more, lest I should bid thee live;
                          Ask me no more.

   Ask me no more:  thy fate and mine are sealed:
      I strove against the stream and all in vain:
      Let the great river take me to the main:
   No more, dear love, for at a touch I yield;
                          Ask me no more.




VII



   So was their sanctuary violated,
   So their fair college turned to hospital;
   At first with all confusion:  by and by
   Sweet order lived again with other laws:
   A kindlier influence reigned; and everywhere
   Low voices with the ministering hand
   Hung round the sick:  the maidens came, they talked,
   They sang, they read:  till she not fair began
   To gather light, and she that was, became
   Her former beauty treble; and to and fro
   With books, with flowers, with Angel offices,
   Like creatures native unto gracious act,
   And in their own clear element, they moved.

        But sadness on the soul of Ida fell,
   And hatred of her weakness, blent with shame.
   Old studies failed; seldom she spoke:  but oft
   Clomb to the roofs, and gazed alone for hours
   On that disastrous leaguer, swarms of men
   Darkening her female field:  void was her use,
   And she as one that climbs a peak to gaze
   O'er land and main, and sees a great black cloud
   Drag inward from the deeps, a wall of night,
   Blot out the slope of sea from verge to shore,
   And suck the blinding splendour from the sand,
   And quenching lake by lake and tarn by tarn
   Expunge the world:  so fared she gazing there;
   So blackened all her world in secret, blank
   And waste it seemed and vain; till down she came,
   And found fair peace once more among the sick.

        And twilight dawned; and morn by morn the lark
   Shot up and shrilled in flickering gyres, but I
   Lay silent in the muffled cage of life:
   And twilight gloomed; and broader-grown the bowers
   Drew the great night into themselves, and Heaven,
   Star after Star, arose and fell; but I,
   Deeper than those weird doubts could reach me, lay
   Quite sundered from the moving Universe,
   Nor knew what eye was on me, nor the hand
   That nursed me, more than infants in their sleep.

        But Psyche tended Florian:  with her oft,
   Melissa came; for Blanche had gone, but left
   Her child among us, willing she should keep
   Court-favour:  here and there the small bright head,
   A light of healing, glanced about the couch,
   Or through the parted silks the tender face
   Peeped, shining in upon the wounded man
   With blush and smile, a medicine in themselves
   To wile the length from languorous hours, and draw
   The sting from pain; nor seemed it strange that soon
   He rose up whole, and those fair charities
   Joined at her side; nor stranger seemed that hears
   So gentle, so employed, should close in love,
   Than when two dewdrops on the petals shake
   To the same sweet air, and tremble deeper down,
   And slip at once all-fragrant into one.

        Less prosperously the second suit obtained
   At first with Psyche.  Not though Blanche had sworn
   That after that dark night among the fields
   She needs must wed him for her own good name;
        Not though he built upon the babe restored;
   Nor though she liked him, yielded she, but feared
   To incense the Head once more; till on a day
   When Cyril pleaded, Ida came behind
   Seen but of Psyche:  on her foot she hung
   A moment, and she heard, at which her face
   A little flushed, and she past on; but each
   Assumed from thence a half-consent involved
   In stillness, plighted troth, and were at peace.

        Nor only these:  Love in the sacred halls
   Held carnival at will, and flying struck
   With showers of random sweet on maid and man.
   Nor did her father cease to press my claim,
   Nor did mine own, now reconciled; nor yet
   Did those twin-brothers, risen again and whole;
   Nor Arac, satiate with his victory.

        But I lay still, and with me oft she sat:
   Then came a change; for sometimes I would catch
   Her hand in wild delirium, gripe it hard,
   And fling it like a viper off, and shriek
   'You are not Ida;' clasp it once again,
   And call her Ida, though I knew her not,
   And call her sweet, as if in irony,
   And call her hard and cold which seemed a truth:
   And still she feared that I should lose my mind,
   And often she believed that I should die:
   Till out of long frustration of her care,
   And pensive tendance in the all-weary noons,
   And watches in the dead, the dark, when clocks
   Throbbed thunder through the palace floors, or called
   On flying Time from all their silver tongues--
   And out of memories of her kindlier days,
   And sidelong glances at my father's grief,
   And at the happy lovers heart in heart--
   And out of hauntings of my spoken love,
   And lonely listenings to my muttered dream,
   And often feeling of the helpless hands,
   And wordless broodings on the wasted cheek--
   From all a closer interest flourished up,
   Tenderness touch by touch, and last, to these,
   Love, like an Alpine harebell hung with tears
   By some cold morning glacier; frail at first
   And feeble, all unconscious of itself,
   But such as gathered colour day by day.

   Last I woke sane, but well-nigh close to death
   For weakness:  it was evening:  silent light
   Slept on the painted walls, wherein were wrought
   Two grand designs; for on one side arose
   The women up in wild revolt, and stormed
   At the Oppian Law.  Titanic shapes, they crammed
   The forum, and half-crushed among the rest
   A dwarf-like Cato cowered.  On the other side
   Hortensia spoke against the tax; behind,
   A train of dames:  by axe and eagle sat,
   With all their foreheads drawn in Roman scowls,
   And half the wolf's-milk curdled in their veins,
   The fierce triumvirs; and before them paused
   Hortensia pleading:  angry was her face.

        I saw the forms:  I knew not where I was:
   They did but look like hollow shows; nor more
   Sweet Ida:  palm to palm she sat:  the dew
   Dwelt in her eyes, and softer all her shape
   And rounder seemed:  I moved:  I sighed:  a touch
   Came round my wrist, and tears upon my hand:
   Then all for languor and self-pity ran
   Mine down my face, and with what life I had,
   And like a flower that cannot all unfold,
   So drenched it is with tempest, to the sun,
   Yet, as it may, turns toward him, I on her
   Fixt my faint eyes, and uttered whisperingly:

        'If you be, what I think you, some sweet dream,
   I would but ask you to fulfil yourself:
   But if you be that Ida whom I knew,
   I ask you nothing:  only, if a dream,
   Sweet dream, be perfect.  I shall die tonight.
   Stoop down and seem to kiss me ere I die.'

        I could no more, but lay like one in trance,
   That hears his burial talked of by his friends,
   And cannot speak, nor move, nor make one sign,
   But lies and dreads his doom.  She turned; she paused;
   She stooped; and out of languor leapt a cry;
   Leapt fiery Passion from the brinks of death;
   And I believed that in the living world
   My spirit closed with Ida's at the lips;
   Till back I fell, and from mine arms she rose
   Glowing all over noble shame; and all
   Her falser self slipt from her like a robe,
   And left her woman, lovelier in her mood
   Than in her mould that other, when she came
   From barren deeps to conquer all with love;
   And down the streaming crystal dropt; and she
   Far-fleeted by the purple island-sides,
   Naked, a double light in air and wave,
   To meet her Graces, where they decked her out
   For worship without end; nor end of mine,
   Stateliest, for thee! but mute she glided forth,
   Nor glanced behind her, and I sank and slept,
   Filled through and through with Love, a happy sleep.

        Deep in the night I woke:  she, near me, held
   A volume of the Poets of her land:
   There to herself, all in low tones, she read.


      'Now sleeps the crimson petal, now the white;
   Nor waves the cypress in the palace walk;
   Nor winks the gold fin in the porphyry font:
   The fire-fly wakens:  wake thou with me.

      Now droops the milkwhite peacock like a ghost,
   And like a ghost she glimmers on to me.

      Now lies the Earth all Danae to the stars,
   And all thy heart lies open unto me.

      Now lies the silent meteor on, and leaves
   A shining furrow, as thy thoughts in me.

      Now folds the lily all her sweetness up,
   And slips into the bosom of the lake:
   So fold thyself, my dearest, thou, and slip
   Into my bosom and be lost in me.'


   I heard her turn the page; she found a small
   Sweet Idyl, and once more, as low, she read:


      'Come down, O maid, from yonder mountain height:
   What pleasure lives in height (the shepherd sang)
   In height and cold, the splendour of the hills?
   But cease to move so near the Heavens, and cease
   To glide a sunbeam by the blasted Pine,
   To sit a star upon the sparkling spire;
   And come, for love is of the valley, come,
   For love is of the valley, come thou down
   And find him; by the happy threshold, he,
   Or hand in hand with Plenty in the maize,
   Or red with spirted purple of the vats,
   Or foxlike in the vine; nor cares to walk
   With Death and Morning on the silver horns,
   Nor wilt thou snare him in the white ravine,
   Nor find him dropt upon the firths of ice,
   That huddling slant in furrow-cloven falls
   To roll the torrent out of dusky doors:
   But follow; let the torrent dance thee down
   To find him in the valley; let the wild
   Lean-headed Eagles yelp alone, and leave
   The monstrous ledges there to slope, and spill
   Their thousand wreaths of dangling water-smoke,
   That like a broken purpose waste in air:
   So waste not thou; but come; for all the vales
   Await thee; azure pillars of the hearth
   Arise to thee; the children call, and I
   Thy shepherd pipe, and sweet is every sound,
   Sweeter thy voice, but every sound is sweet;
   Myriads of rivulets hurrying through the lawn,
   The moan of doves in immemorial elms,
   And murmuring of innumerable bees.'


   So she low-toned; while with shut eyes I lay
   Listening; then looked.  Pale was the perfect face;
   The bosom with long sighs laboured; and meek
   Seemed the full lips, and mild the luminous eyes,
   And the voice trembled and the hand.  She said
   Brokenly, that she knew it, she had failed
   In sweet humility; had failed in all;
   That all her labour was but as a block
   Left in the quarry; but she still were loth,
   She still were loth to yield herself to one
   That wholly scorned to help their equal rights
   Against the sons of men, and barbarous laws.
   She prayed me not to judge their cause from her
   That wronged it, sought far less for truth than power
   In knowledge:  something wild within her breast,
   A greater than all knowledge, beat her down.
   And she had nursed me there from week to week:
   Much had she learnt in little time.  In part
   It was ill counsel had misled the girl
   To vex true hearts:  yet was she but a girl--
   'Ah fool, and made myself a Queen of farce!
   When comes another such? never, I think,
   Till the Sun drop, dead, from the signs.'
                                            Her voice
   choked, and her forehead sank upon her hands,
   And her great heart through all the faultful Past
   Went sorrowing in a pause I dared not break;
   Till notice of a change in the dark world
   Was lispt about the acacias, and a bird,
   That early woke to feed her little ones,
   Sent from a dewy breast a cry for light:
   She moved, and at her feet the volume fell.

        'Blame not thyself too much,' I said, 'nor blame
   Too much the sons of men and barbarous laws;
   These were the rough ways of the world till now.
   Henceforth thou hast a helper, me, that know
   The woman's cause is man's:  they rise or sink
   Together, dwarfed or godlike, bond or free:
   For she that out of Lethe scales with man
   The shining steps of Nature, shares with man
   His nights, his days, moves with him to one goal,
   Stays all the fair young planet in her hands--
   If she be small, slight-natured, miserable,
   How shall men grow? but work no more alone!
   Our place is much:  as far as in us lies
   We two will serve them both in aiding her--
   Will clear away the parasitic forms
   That seem to keep her up but drag her down--
   Will leave her space to burgeon out of all
   Within her--let her make herself her own
   To give or keep, to live and learn and be
   All that not harms distinctive womanhood.
   For woman is not undevelopt man,
   But diverse:  could we make her as the man,
   Sweet Love were slain:  his dearest bond is this,
   Not like to like, but like in difference.
   Yet in the long years liker must they grow;
   The man be more of woman, she of man;
   He gain in sweetness and in moral height,
   Nor lose the wrestling thews that throw the world;
   She mental breadth, nor fail in childward care,
   Nor lose the childlike in the larger mind;
   Till at the last she set herself to man,
   Like perfect music unto noble words;
   And so these twain, upon the skirts of Time,
   Sit side by side, full-summed in all their powers,
   Dispensing harvest, sowing the To-be,
   Self-reverent each and reverencing each,
   Distinct in individualities,
   But like each other even as those who love.
   Then comes the statelier Eden back to men:
   Then reign the world's great bridals, chaste and calm:
   Then springs the crowning race of humankind.
   May these things be!'
                        Sighing she spoke 'I fear
   They will not.'
                  'Dear, but let us type them now
   In our own lives, and this proud watchword rest
   Of equal; seeing either sex alone
   Is half itself, and in true marriage lies
   Nor equal, nor unequal:  each fulfils
   Defect in each, and always thought in thought,
   Purpose in purpose, will in will, they grow,
   The single pure and perfect animal,
   The two-celled heart beating, with one full stroke,
   Life.'
         And again sighing she spoke:  'A dream
   That once was mind! what woman taught you this?'

        'Alone,' I said, 'from earlier than I know,
   Immersed in rich foreshadowings of the world,
   I loved the woman:  he, that doth not, lives
   A drowning life, besotted in sweet self,
   Or pines in sad experience worse than death,
   Or keeps his winged affections clipt with crime:
   Yet was there one through whom I loved her, one
   Not learned, save in gracious household ways,
   Not perfect, nay, but full of tender wants,
   No Angel, but a dearer being, all dipt
   In Angel instincts, breathing Paradise,
   Interpreter between the Gods and men,
   Who looked all native to her place, and yet
   On tiptoe seemed to touch upon a sphere
   Too gross to tread, and all male minds perforce
   Swayed to her from their orbits as they moved,
   And girdled her with music.  Happy he
   With such a mother! faith in womankind
   Beats with his blood, and trust in all things high
   Comes easy to him, and though he trip and fall
   He shall not blind his soul with clay.'
                                          'But I,'
   Said Ida, tremulously, 'so all unlike--
   It seems you love to cheat yourself with words:
   This mother is your model.  I have heard
   of your strange doubts:  they well might be:  I seem
   A mockery to my own self.  Never, Prince;
   You cannot love me.'
                       'Nay but thee' I said
   'From yearlong poring on thy pictured eyes,
   Ere seen I loved, and loved thee seen, and saw
   Thee woman through the crust of iron moods
   That masked thee from men's reverence up, and forced
   Sweet love on pranks of saucy boyhood:  now,
   Given back to life, to life indeed, through thee,
   Indeed I love:  the new day comes, the light
   Dearer for night, as dearer thou for faults
   Lived over:  lift thine eyes; my doubts are dead,
   My haunting sense of hollow shows:  the change,
   This truthful change in thee has killed it.  Dear,
   Look up, and let thy nature strike on mine,
   Like yonder morning on the blind half-world;
   Approach and fear not; breathe upon my brows;
   In that fine air I tremble, all the past
   Melts mist-like into this bright hour, and this
   Is morn to more, and all the rich to-come
   Reels, as the golden Autumn woodland reels
   Athwart the smoke of burning weeds.  Forgive me,
   I waste my heart in signs:  let be.  My bride,
   My wife, my life.  O we will walk this world,
   Yoked in all exercise of noble end,
   And so through those dark gates across the wild
   That no man knows.  Indeed I love thee:  come,
   Yield thyself up:  my hopes and thine are one:
   Accomplish thou my manhood and thyself;
   Lay thy sweet hands in mine and trust to me.'




CONCLUSION



   So closed our tale, of which I give you all
   The random scheme as wildly as it rose:
   The words are mostly mine; for when we ceased
   There came a minute's pause, and Walter said,
   'I wish she had not yielded!' then to me,
   'What, if you drest it up poetically?'
   So prayed the men, the women:  I gave assent:
   Yet how to bind the scattered scheme of seven
   Together in one sheaf?  What style could suit?
   The men required that I should give throughout
   The sort of mock-heroic gigantesque,
   With which we bantered little Lilia first:
   The women--and perhaps they felt their power,
   For something in the ballads which they sang,
   Or in their silent influence as they sat,
   Had ever seemed to wrestle with burlesque,
   And drove us, last, to quite a solemn close--
   They hated banter, wished for something real,
   A gallant fight, a noble princess--why
   Not make her true-heroic--true-sublime?
   Or all, they said, as earnest as the close?
   Which yet with such a framework scarce could be.
   Then rose a little feud betwixt the two,
   Betwixt the mockers and the realists:
   And I, betwixt them both, to please them both,
   And yet to give the story as it rose,
   I moved as in a strange diagonal,
   And maybe neither pleased myself nor them.

        But Lilia pleased me, for she took no part
   In our dispute:  the sequel of the tale
   Had touched her; and she sat, she plucked the grass,
   She flung it from her, thinking:  last, she fixt
   A showery glance upon her aunt, and said,
   'You--tell us what we are' who might have told,
   For she was crammed with theories out of books,
   But that there rose a shout:  the gates were closed
   At sunset, and the crowd were swarming now,
   To take their leave, about the garden rails.

        So I and some went out to these:  we climbed
   The slope to Vivian-place, and turning saw
   The happy valleys, half in light, and half
   Far-shadowing from the west, a land of peace;
   Gray halls alone among their massive groves;
   Trim hamlets; here and there a rustic tower
   Half-lost in belts of hop and breadths of wheat;
   The shimmering glimpses of a stream; the seas;
   A red sail, or a white; and far beyond,
   Imagined more than seen, the skirts of France.

        'Look there, a garden!' said my college friend,
   The Tory member's elder son, 'and there!
   God bless the narrow sea which keeps her off,
   And keeps our Britain, whole within herself,
   A nation yet, the rulers and the ruled--
   Some sense of duty, something of a faith,
   Some reverence for the laws ourselves have made,
   Some patient force to change them when we will,
   Some civic manhood firm against the crowd--
   But yonder, whiff! there comes a sudden heat,
   The gravest citizen seems to lose his head,
   The king is scared, the soldier will not fight,
   The little boys begin to shoot and stab,
   A kingdom topples over with a shriek
   Like an old woman, and down rolls the world
   In mock heroics stranger than our own;
   Revolts, republics, revolutions, most
   No graver than a schoolboys' barring out;
   Too comic for the serious things they are,
   Too solemn for the comic touches in them,
   Like our wild Princess with as wise a dream
   As some of theirs--God bless the narrow seas!
   I wish they were a whole Atlantic broad.'

        'Have patience,' I replied, 'ourselves are full
   Of social wrong; and maybe wildest dreams
   Are but the needful preludes of the truth:
   For me, the genial day, the happy crowd,
   The sport half-science, fill me with a faith.
   This fine old world of ours is but a child
   Yet in the go-cart.  Patience!  Give it time
   To learn its limbs:  there is a hand that guides.'

        In such discourse we gained the garden rails,
   And there we saw Sir Walter where he stood,
   Before a tower of crimson holly-hoaks,
   Among six boys, head under head, and looked
   No little lily-handed Baronet he,
   A great broad-shouldered genial Englishman,
   A lord of fat prize-oxen and of sheep,
   A raiser of huge melons and of pine,
   A patron of some thirty charities,
   A pamphleteer on guano and on grain,
   A quarter-sessions chairman, abler none;
   Fair-haired and redder than a windy morn;
   Now shaking hands with him, now him, of those
   That stood the nearest--now addressed to speech--
   Who spoke few words and pithy, such as closed
   Welcome, farewell, and welcome for the year
   To follow:  a shout rose again, and made
   The long line of the approaching rookery swerve
   From the elms, and shook the branches of the deer
   From slope to slope through distant ferns, and rang
   Beyond the bourn of sunset; O, a shout
   More joyful than the city-roar that hails
   Premier or king!  Why should not these great Sirs
   Give up their parks some dozen times a year
   To let the people breathe?  So thrice they cried,
   I likewise, and in groups they streamed away.

        But we went back to the Abbey, and sat on,
   So much the gathering darkness charmed:  we sat
   But spoke not, rapt in nameless reverie,
   Perchance upon the future man:  the walls
   Blackened about us, bats wheeled, and owls whooped,
   And gradually the powers of the night,
   That range above the region of the wind,
   Deepening the courts of twilight broke them up
   Through all the silent spaces of the worlds,
   Beyond all thought into the Heaven of Heavens.

        Last little Lilia, rising quietly,
   Disrobed the glimmering statue of Sir Ralph
   From those rich silks, and home well-pleased we went.

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1

posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
