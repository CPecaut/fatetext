The remaining chapters will explain how products which arise and disintegrate do not have even the slightest essence of inherent existence..(i.e. They are like figures seen in clouds, like swirls at the surface of the ocean. All merely imputed by the mind, but not from the mind only. Not existent, not non-existent, not both, not neither. All equal and pure in emptiness; non-dual: not two, not one.).L1: [Section II - A : Extensively explaining ultimate truth].-- Chapter 9 - Refuting Permanent Functional Phenomena - Everything is both cause and effect, whole and part, merely imputed by the mind - the Middle Way in causality: no absolute causality / path, no absence of causality - P.203-- Chapter 10 - Refuting Misconceptions of the Self - There is nothing permanent that is having rebirths, or is being Liberated - P.215-- Chapter 11 - Refuting Truly Existent Time - There is no truly existing absolute time, duration or impermanence - P.227-- Chapter 12 - Refuting Wrong Views - We need a gradual path combining virtuous methods and wisdom.

There is not limits to this in both direction. -- Because all functional things are in interdependence, everything is impermanent.-- Cause and effect cannot exist simultaneously; one stops, one starts-- Cause and effect cannot exist separately-- Because everything is cause & effect, everything is impermanent-- Nothing last even a moment, everything is continually changing, a continuous flow of interdependence.-- So everything is just an illusion, everything is empty of inherent existence.-- BECAUSE EVERYTHING IS DEPENDENTLY ARISING, EVERYTHING IS EMPTY OF INHERENT EXISTENCE -- It is the mind that puts names on the flow, and then thinks things really exist on their own..-- About liberation & a liberated self-- Liberation is, like space, a negation, not a functional thing. Otherwise as an effect, it would also be a cause, and there would be no end.-- No self imputed on the aggregates is liberated, thus no real functional liberation; it is just a concept.-- There would be no need for consciousness at liberation; and there is no person without consciousness-- at liberation there is no more seed of consciousness either-- There no need to speculate about anything after liberation, after the cessation of those illusions-- There is no other self outside of the aggregates that could be liberated-- So thinking about liberating a self is a mistake-- To maintain morality, the belief in a self may be necessary for beginners)..L3: [I.

Actual meaning].\ ###\ 201.\ ALL ARE PRODUCED FOR THEIR EFFECT,\ THUS NONE ARE PERMANENT.\ There are no Tathagatas other than\ Subduers [who know] things as they are..(i.e. Everything is a cause and an effect, thus impermanent. First, without being a cause of something / functional, anything would be as if non-existent - not even perceptible by the six senses; and there were be no need to talk about it. So everything produced is a cause / functional.-- Second, since their causing-action is necessarily triggered and modulated by their own causes and conditions, all causes are also an effect.-- Beside being dependent on other causes and conditions, and having a triggered beginning for its casing function, there is necessary an end to this causing-action, thus they are all impermanent.).(i.e. All is functional phenomena ausing an effect, and being dependent on other causes & conditions, thus nothing is permanent -- this apply to space, time, mind, self, particles ... Functional things are by definition the causes of some effects, their functions, and are themselves the results of causes and conditions, because there is no absolute cause producing an absolute result 100% of the time whatever happen. There are always mitigating conditions. Thus functional phenomena are both cause and effect. And they are not permanent, because as effect they cannot be there before the production, and as cause they have to go away after the production otherwise there would be continuous production.-- This means that the division of the categories of existent phenomena into permanent and functional / impermanent is artificial.-- Everything is functional / impermanent.-- There is absolutely nothing permanent.-- The four types of permanent phenomena (see bellow) are thus not valid: space, analytical cessation, non-analytical cessation, and even suchness.-- And all functional phenomena -- form, sense organs, objects, consciousness, mind, mental factors, self, karma, concepts ... -- are all both cause and effect, impermanent, not independent, not self-- Everything is in dependence, everything is empty of inherent existence-- So "permanent" and "functional" are contradictory terms.).10 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]-- In the world it is accepted that when a laborer work hard for his wage, it is for the result and not because it is his nature to do so. Similarly all external and internal functional phenomena do not arise of their own accord. Since they are produced solely through a multifarious aggregation of factors consisting of interrelated causes and effects, functional things are produced for their effects. They therefore are not permanent, inherently produced or truly existent. They do not have an essence able to sustain analysis, nor do they exist as things in and of themselves.Only Subduers, because they have the abilities of perfected body, speech and mind, directly know impermanence, emptiness and all things without exception as they are. Since no one else does, there are no other Tathagatas. Moreover the Teacher said, "Whatever is produced inevitably ceases, for aging and death are conditioned by birth." Thus, since production is for the sake of disintegration, nothing endures by way of its own entity.Some refute permanence and true existence by virtue of autonomous reasons. The unfeasibility of this is explained in Candrakirti's commentary. There is no commonly appearing subject, such as a sprout, posited by tenets, in relation to which a direct valid cognition perceiving it is valid, since all except Prasangikas assert that it is valid in relation to a sprout existing by way of its own character. Prasangikas assert this is impossible..L4: [B.

Thus never is there anywhere a permanent functional phenomenon. Since whatever exists only exists dependently, it does not have even the slightest existence by way of its own entity.).L3: [II.

We do not assert that time is non-existent, for it says:13 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]~ The actions of the embodied do not~ Go to waste even in a hundred aeons.~ When conditions assemble and the time is ripe~ Their fruit will mature.) .L5: [2.

So time is necessarily a functional thing, both a cause and an effect, thus impermanent.).(-- If proponents of time as a cause accept it as such, they should also accept it as an effect.-- Without the effect it produced, a cause lacks that which establishes it as a cause, for the establishment of a cause depends on its effects.

So the effect would be without a cause. That would be absurd; nothing is without cause and conditions. So, there cannot be a permanent functional thing, a cause that is not an effect itself, that is not itself dependent, and thus impermanent. All causes are effects, and impermanent.)14 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2].(-- If one does not accept that time, too, changes, it follows that a functional thing, such as a sprout whose cause is unchanging permanent time, has come about of its own accord because of being produced by a cause that has not come into being.

If some parts coalesce, those that do are causes while those that do not are not causes.-- It therefore follows that the smallest particle has parts, because some of its sides are causes while others are not.

The path is not the real cause of Liberation. Liberation is not an effect caused, or produced by the path as if they were absolute cause, and absolute effect. If Liberation was a final effect produced by an absolutely perfect causing path, then it would be dependent and impermanent. It would also be a cause and have further samsaric effect. Thus it would not be called Liberation. -- As demonstrated above, there are no real causes and effects as we usually think they exist. Liberation, like space, is the negation of something else. But this something else, as we will see, is not really inherently existing either - and that is the whole point. Liberation and samsara are co- dependently arisen concepts. Transcendence is going beyond this duality - not taking one side like accepting one and rejecting the other, nor both, nor neither. Transcendence is seeing through illusions created by our own mind, seeing through all opposites / dualities.).(About real cessations: liberation is just another concept. There is no causal path, and no final result. (i.e. Liberation is taught as the final effect, caused but not causing anything else. A permanent functional phenomena.) If it is a produced functional thing, it would necessarily have an effect, a function. If liberation is caused, and the path exist, then it would be an effect. By there is no effect which are not cause of something else. So it would not be called liberation, because it18 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]would produce something else -- more karma. So "liberation" is not a functional thing, but a mere concept.-- Finally the chapter presents a critique of liberation as asserted by the opponent. It cannot be a functional phenomenon as claimed, for then it should produce an effect, but none can be identified.-- Assertion of our own sectarians who do not understand uncompounded phenomena as merely nominal: Although it is true that Buddhas do not mention permanent particles, they say uncompounded phenomena are permanent. Thus there is substantially existent cessation, which is like a dam. If this were not so it would be inappropriate to speak of the third noble truth.-- Answer: True source bind to cyclic existence, true sufferings are that which is bound and true paths are the means which liberate one from sufferings and their sources. If liberation which is other than these were a functional phenomena, it should facilitate an effect, but it does not produce any effect and not the slightest facilitation occurs. Thus it is inappropriate to call such a substantially existent cessation "liberation." It contradicts what the Teacher said: "Monks, these five are only names - past time, future time, space, nirvana, and the person." One should therefore accept liberation as a mere term, a mere imputation and not as substantially existent.).L6: [b.

According to proponents of functional things as truly existent, this citation means the aggregates are entirely non-existent in the sphere of nirvana. Nor can there be a person imputed in dependence upon them, for neither the reliance nor reliant exist-- cd: Neither the aggregates nor the person are seen as a truly existent reliance which reaches nirvana through the ending of disturbing attitudes and rebirth.

You also assert that it is the person's nature to be conscious and that this is permanent and immutable. What is the value of accepting the existence of consciousness during liberation?

Instead of speculating about what is beyond all conceptualization, we should concentrate on the actual problem: the belief in a permanent self, and the realization that it is the root cause of all suffering. That is a sure thing in the actual context.).(So don't think about liberating a permanent self -- that would be a mistake: So without the perception of a self based on the five aggregates, there is no more suffering. And there is no other causeless permanent self which does not depend on the aggregates. There is no liberated self.-- It is certain that in the state of nirvana, people who have gained liberation from suffering by completely abandoning the contaminated aggregates through the total elimination of disturbing attitudes and emotions have no other causeless permanent self which does not depend on the aggregates. Therefore people who aspire to become free should always affirm that the complete ending forever of conceptions of a self is good and should never assert the existence of such a20 / 117useless liberated self.) .Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]L3: [III.

Between the two truths, or between two extremes, it is preferable for beginners to think that there is a self that has to be Liberated by following a path consisting of virtuous methods - to think in real cause and effect like taught in the teaching of dependent origination, the Wheel of Life. It is preferable to start with the Hinayana teachings, because of the danger of total rejection of the dharma or failing into nihilism are great. Then it is preferable to teach love, compassion, patience, bodhicitta. Receptivity to a more subtle wisdom will come later. But, of course, a right path has to combine method and wisdom (the two accumulations) all the time, because only the wisdom directly realizing the true nature of reality is the final antidote, and only accumulating enough merit can make this possible.).(-- Assertion: "the four lines of the stanza."-- If during liberation there is no liberated self, and nirvana which is termed the ultimate is said to be mere ending of conceptions of a self through the non-recurrence of that which is composite, what is the purpose of striving for such an ultimate? It is preferable for those interested in their own good to accept conventionalities like eyes, sprouts and so forth but not to assert any ultimate, for ordinary people have some belief in virtuous and non-virtuous actions, their homes, forests and so forth but none whatsoever in the ultimate.-- This stanza was written in connection with the extensive refutation of the self in the following chapter.

But that doesn't mean that there is no cause, condition or causality at all, or that we should drop all virtuous paths right now.

And all the mental constructions based on this assumption are stopped. There is no more acquisition of karma resulting in the five aggregates (from rebirth, or as adaptation within a suppose "life").

Gender cannot be an essential attribute of the permanent inner self since it can change with rebirths. The basis for the attributes cannot be found in the whole. All attributes that would define a permanent self are like that, they change, they are impermanent. So they cannot be used to prove the existence of an inherently existing self.).-- i.e. To maintain the need for morality with ordinary people who do not understand the true meaning of emptiness, some feel that there is a need to teach about a self, although very subtle, that could be liberated, and about a self that goes through rebirths. Otherwise they would think there is nothing after death, that they could escape the consequences of their actions through death, or that liberation is like annihilation of their own self. So, lets try to find this self..(First the self asserted by the Vaisesikas. First it is shown that gender, which differs from one life to the next, is incompatible with the idea of a permanent self.-- Male, female, neuter are not absolute attribute of a permanent self.-- If the so-called self existed by way of its own entity, [it should be seen in the state of nirvana.] Fearing its discontinuation because it is not seen during nirvana, they say, "The conventional is preferable," and so forth. However the self does not exist by way of its own entity for if it did, it should be male, female or neuter, but that is inappropriate. The Forders assert two selves, an inner and an outer self. The first is inside the body, and this inner agent which makes the various sense organs engage with objects is the focus of the conception "I" The second is a combination of the body and sense organs which assists the first.It follows that the inner self does not exist by way of its own entity. If it did a woman should in the future lives too only ever be a woman, yet change is observed. Femaleness and so forth are also not attributes of the self. Thus it follows that the inner agential person does not exist by way of its own entity, for when the inner self is neither female, male or neuter, it is just out of ignorant confusion that you imagine your own self male. It is a fabrication like mistaking a mottled rope for a snake. Sutra says:~ An attitude of doubt foments poison,~ And though it has not entered one, one faints) .L6: [b.

Gender cannot be an attribute of the outer self either since we cannot find it in the parts; gender is merely an imputation, a conventional name. All attributes that would be used to define an inherently existing self are like that.).23 / 117.Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2](If you try to find this "female state", as the goddess did in the Vimalakirti Sutra, you will not find it. It is merely a name attributed, by convention, to some basis. So the self is not "essentially by nature" male, or female, or neuter.-- Assertion: Male gender, female gender and so forth are marks of the outer self. Through its connection with this the inner self is male and so forth.-- Answer: It follows that because of their connection with the outer self, the four great elements would also be a male self and so forth. If that were so, all the elements would be the person, since for truly existent functional things there can be no differences between what is and is not male and so forth.-- When all the elements do not have male, female or neuter gender, how can the inner self which relies upon the outer self -- those elements -- feasibly be male, female or neuter? It cannot. If all the elements were male, female or neuter, it would follow that even during the early stages of the fetus, maleness and so forth should be observable.-- Objection: The same error is entailed for you.-- Answer: Since we impute gender in dependence upon elements which lack inherent existence, there is no error.).L6: [c.

It is merely an imputation of the mind, a convention, a concept.).(Sort of like: the perception of the "self" of someone is relative. It depends on the subject and on many other factors. It is a creation of the mind, an imputation on a valid base. If the "I" was an absolute functional thing everybody would see it as such, the "I", independently of who is looking. But, as we all know, the "I" is relative to the person looking. Exactly like right and left is relative to the position of the subject.-- It follows that the personal self is not established by way of its own entity. If it were, just as the thought "blue" arises universally in relation to blue, the thought "I" should arise in Yajna when he observes Devadatta's self, but it does not. -- Since that which is your self is not my own self, it follows that the object of your conception of "I" is not a self existing by way of its own entity, because it is not ascertained as the object of my conception of "I" or my attachment to the self. Therefore doesn't the thought "I" arise in relation to impermanent things called form and so forth? The self is only imputed.).L5: [2. Refuting the proofs]L6: [a.

We cannot find a self that would be separated from the aggregates.).(-- Assertion: The self is permanent because of being the one that enters and leaves cyclic existence. If there were no self, who would be in cyclic existence because of accumulation actions? Who would gain freedom from cyclic existence? Thus the self exists.-- Answer: It follows that it is illogical for the self you assert to be permanent and a separate entity from the body, because the person, like the body, changes from one rebirth as a god, human and so forth to another.).L6: [b.

This is like the problem of the interaction between mind and matter in western philosophy. It has never been seen that an intangible could cause an effect on a tangible. So this inner self cannot exist and be the "driver" of your actions. This is like the fact that a permanent cause cannot create an impermanent effect as mentioned in chapter 9.-- Nor can a permanent intangible self act as agent of the body's movement, as is claimed, since only something tangible can cause motion.-- Assertion: Without a self there would be no physical movements such as stretching of flexing because the body would lack an activator. Thus an inner agential person exists who activates the body just as Devadatta drives his chariot. -- Answer: That is illogical. It follows that your life force or self is not the instigator of physical movement because the self is not tangible.-- It is so because, just as a chariot can only be moved by something tangible and not by anything intangible, an intangible functional thing cannot actually move that which has form from one place to another. Though Vaisesikas assert that the self has form, they do not accept that it has external tangibility and so forth.).L7: [(2) Showing what invalidated [belief in] a permanent self].\ ###\ 231.\ Why [teach] non-violence and wonder about\ Conditions for a permanent self?\ A diamond never has to be\ Protected against woodworm..(i.e. A permanent self would not need morality: On the contrary, it is the though of a permanent self that would eliminate the need for morality.).(-- A permanent self would be invulnerable to harm of any kind and would therefore not need to seek spiritual practices as a means of protection.-- It follows that if the self is permanent, it is contradictory to teach non-violence as a practice to protect it from dangers such as a bad rebirth or to wonder what conditions are not unfavorable to it, because nothing can harm a permanent functional thing, just as a diamond which is not in danger of harm is never protected against woodworms, nor does it need to be.).L6: [c.

There is no need for inherently existing causes and effects to explain interdependence, to support dependent origination. On the contrary, one would not exist without the other; dependent origination and emptiness implies each other. The continuum permits the uninterrupted flow of influences / information / cause & effect, without assuming inherently existing causes and effects.)25 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2].(-- Nor does memory of past lives establish the self as permanent, but demonstrates the presence of a continuum of consciousness, consisting of moments which arise in dependence upon each other.-- Assertion: The self is permanent because there is memory of previous rebirths. Memory of other lives is not feasible for a composite thing whose nature is to disintegrate as soon as it is produced.-- Answer: You may consider the self permanent because there is memory of past lives, like thinking, "I was human in my last rebirth." Then how could your body be impermanent? It should be permanent because in a past life you saw the scar of a wound inflicted on the body and now, when you see a birthmark which resembles that previously inflicted wound, you say, "That is the scar of the wound inflicted in the past." According to us the object of the thought "I" is co- extensive with both the past and of this life. Since it is merely imputed, memory of past rebirths is feasible.There is a bowl of curd in a house. The footprint of a pale-colored pigeon perched on the thick thatch is visible on it, even though its foot has not touched the curd and so forth. Similarly, all actions and agents are feasible for that which arises dependently.).L7: [(2) Unfeasibility of mindless matter remembering past rebirths].\ ###\ 233.\ If the self when possessing that\ Which has mind is a knower,\ By that [same argument] that which has mind would be\ Mindless and the person permanent..(i.e. The self is not different, nor the same as karma / memories: On the contrary, the simple fact that it can accumulate memory makes this self impermanent. This self cannot be separated from the mind, nor can it be the same as the mind - next verse.).(-- If, as claimed, the person were mindless matter only capable of memory through an association with consciousness, then the person could not be permanent and unchanging, since it would first lack and then possess the faculty of remembering-- It follows that the self cannot remember past rebirths because it is asserted as mindless matter. It is also unreasonable to assert that it remembers past lives by virtue of having mind, because by first lacking memory and later possessing memory, it has given up its entity.-- If the self, despite being matter, is a knower of the past because of possessing that which has mind, by that [same argument] the attribute, that which has mind, should be mindless and matter because of possessing a self which is classified as matter. It follows that the self is also not permanent because first it does not remember but later newly develops memory of past lives.).L7: [(3) Entailment of permanence, if that which has attributes such as intelligence remembers past rebirths].\ ###\ 234.\ A life force which has pleasure and so forth\ Appears as various as pleasure and so forth.\ Thus like pleasure it is not\ Suitable as something permanent..(i.e. The self is not different, nor the same as the five aggregates: The simple fact that it can change makes it impermanent.).(-- Moreover something which at different times has different attributes, such as pleasure and pain, cannot be permanent either.-- If the life force or self has mind because of having attributes like intelligence, then because of having attributes like pleasure and pain, it should appear as different as pleasure and so forth while experiencing satisfaction and affliction. Thus like pleasure and so forth it cannot be permanent either.).26 / 117.\ ###Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]L4: [B.

Those two are interdependent, two concepts co-dependently arisen.).(-- The Samkhya assertion that a permanent conscious person exists is then examined and its flaws are revealed. What role would the eyes and other senses play, if such a continually conscious person existed?-- Samkhya assertion: If the self is asserted as matter these inconsistencies apply, but since, according to us, the person's nature is to be conscious, there is not the least unwanted entailment.-- Answer: Samkhyas define twenty-five categories of phenomena of which twenty-two are matter and the twenty-fifth is asserted as the knower, person and self . They assert that the person experiences objects which the intellect makes it crave. This is explained extensively elsewhere.-- If the conscious person is asserted as permanent, it follows that agents such as the eyes and so forth which permit experience of objects are superfluous and useless because the person that experiences objects exists as a permanent functional thing.

So there is no permanent consciousness.).(Maybe like in "the doer does" the subject and the action are not one, neither separate. Here, the self and the activity of being conscious cannot be thought as separated independent entity, nor as the same. Consciousness is not something added to a permanent self.-- Assertion: The person whose nature is potential consciousness is the experiencer of objects and being conscious is the activity of experiencing. Since this depends on agents like the eye, there is no flaw.-- Answer: Movement does not occur unless, for instance, a tree is agitated by the wind, but those fallacies would entail movement until the substantial entity disintegrates. The phenomenon of activity depends on the substantial entity and its motion.-- The activity of moving depends on the substantial entity and may cease even though the substantial entity has not disintegrated. The nature of the substantial entity does not likewise change between its production and its disintegration. By contrast, consciousness and the person are an indifferentiable permanent entity.

Any transition from the potential consciousness to actual consciousness indicates that the person is not permanent.-- Assertion: Although there is no consciousness prior to experiencing objects, its potential and thus the person exists. -- Answer: On occasions other than when objects are being experienced one sees potential consciousness, and when objects are being experienced, consciousness itself. In that case, like molten iron which later becomes a solid mass, former potential consciousness later becomes actual consciousness.

Since a part of the self the mere size of a particle has mind, there is consciousness of objects. It depends on just this part with mind. A person that is conscious and not separate from mind is produced through this association. The person is permanent and very extensive like space.-- Answer: Since except for a part as small as a particle the rest of this permanent and extensive self is not associated with consciousness, that self's nature does not seem to have consciousness of objects.

Eliminating any fault of annihilation with regard to selflessness]L4: [A. Although there is no self, there is no danger of the composite and transitory discontinuing].\ ###\ 247.\ If the impermanent discontinues\ How could there be grass at present?\ If, indeed, this were true,\ No one would have ignorance either..(i.e. No-self doesn't mean no possible continuity of karma or Liberation: There is no need for a permanent self, to support karma and rebirth, to explain bondage and continuity, and the possibility of Liberation. There is a flow of interdependence without any inherently existing entities in it. There is continuity in the endless chain of causes and effects without the need to postulate any inherently existing cause or effect. - This is the same as saying that emptiness doesn't deny dependent origination, or that the Two Truths are not contradictory, but inseparable...).(Nothing has origination, duration, cessation; nothing is impermanent; this model would not explain continuity and bounding; there is just the flow without anything inherently existent in it. Reality should not be seen as real impermanent things changing from one moment to another through discrete steps. Nothing really originate or discontinue. There is no real cause and effect. Just the continuum. The model consisting of "moments" (ksana) is not consistent, it cannot explain continuity, nor the dependence in samsara. See Karikas 19-21. There is no need for permanence to have continuity, and the illusion of duration; on the contrary, permanent cause and effect would inhibit any change. Bondage is explained with the continuous flow of cause & effect, without the necessity for a permanent self to be the holder of karma.-- All these views are based on a failure to understand that impermanence does not necessitate discontinuation. Nothing impermanent can be produced from a permanent cause. Therefore a permanent self is not feasible as an initiating cause of activity. Products which undergo change moment by moment are neither permanent nor do they discontinue. This become clear when we correctly understand the nature of dependent arising, for though the cause ceases an effect has arisen from it and thus there is continuity.-- Assertion: if there is no self, composite things whose nature is to disintegrate moment by moment would discontinue because of disintegration as soon as they are produced.-- Answer: Understanding impermanence to mean discontinuation is unacceptable. If it did, how could there today be fields and grass whose continuity is beginningless? There should not be any, for if impermanence meant discontinuation, then whatever is impermanent would have the defect of discontinuing. If the view that whatever is impermanent discontinues were true, it follows that no one would have ignorance because it is impermanent. It also follows that pleasure and desire would not occur either.).31 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]L4: [B. Even if a self exists, it is unsuitable as the cause that starts and stops [production]].\ ###\ 248.\ Even if the self exists\ Form is seen to arise from other [causes],\ To continue by virtue of others\ And to disintegrate through others..(i.e. The self is not a primary cause: As we have seen in the previous chapter, a permanent cause cannot explain the effect. The effect is always dependent on an infinity of other causes and conditions, never on only one absolute cause. This cause would itself need to be triggered and stopped. So the self should not be seen as a permanent cause, independent of any other causes and conditions.).(If the self is a permanent cause, all its effects should not be also dependent on other causes and conditions. But that is not what is seen. The self is not a primary permanent absolute cause of everything that is attributed to it. Another way to see this: Seems to point to the fact that "it is not completely mind fabrications"; there are other causes and conditions beside the mind; things are not "non-existent" at all. There is a flow out there, although the chunks are created by our own mind.-- It follows that even if the self exists, it is not acceptable as the initiating cause of things which are seen to arise exclusively from other causes. Fire arises from the contact between sunlight and a fire-crystal, water from the contact between moonlight and a water-crystal, the sprout from the seed, and forms such as the sense organs from an earlier stage of the fetus. They continue because of other factors: fire keeps burning because of fuel and so forth and just as it does not burn when there is insufficient fuel, they disintegrate through other factors. The self cannot exist for if it did, it alone should produce all effects.).L4: [C. Producers and that which is produced exist in relation only to impermanent things].\ ###\ 249.\ Just as the sprout which is a product\ Is produced from a product, the seed,\ Similarly all that is impermanent\ Comes from the impermanent..(i.e. No permanent self, just an endless chain of interdependence / karma: The actual self is an impermanent self that is the result of an endless chain of causes and effects. The five aggregates produce karma; karma conditions the production of the next five aggregates; and both are interdependent endlessly, until one can transcend the whole cycle by seeing through its real nature. There is no need for a permanent self here; there has never been any permanent self; there is no self Liberation.).(-- An effect cannot arise from something permanent and thus, just as the sprout, a product, arises from the seed which is a product, all that is impermanent comes from impermanent causes. Therefore composite things, undergoing production and disintegration moment by moment, can never be permanent nor discontinue. The thunderbolts of permanence and annihilation which strike and destroy the relationship of cause and effect between composite things aredriven off to a distance by the wise with the mantra of dependent arising.) .L4: [D. Showing briefly how permanence and annihilation are avoided in terms of the conventional].\ ###\ 250.\ SINCE FUNCTIONAL THINGS ARISE\ THERE IS NO DISCONTINUATION\ AND BECAUSE THEY CEASE\ THERE IS NO PERMANENCE..(i.e. The Two Truths: dependent origination and emptiness, or karma and no-self. We need both method and wisdom together (the two accumulations) to stay away from all extremes. Dependent origination or karma is the antidote to32 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]nihilism or discontinuity, and emptiness or no-self is the antidote to inherent existence or permanence. Merit is accumulated using methods based on dependent origination, the explanation of the Wheel of Life, the law of karma ... Wisdom is accumulated by gradually combining the realization of the emptiness of inherent existence of all dharmas (including the self) with the various methods until we can transcend it all. Dependent origination and emptiness (or karma and no-self) do not contradict each other; one implies the other.).(-- Since resultant things like sprouts arise and are produced, the cause's continuum is not in danger of being annihilated.

Permanent time would mean that the past and present would still exist in the future - or that the future exist in the present. But, the causes, past and present, are not the same as the effect, future, otherwise there would be no need for production of the future.

Though water, manure, seeds and so forth are present, one observes that sprout, flowers and the like are not produced at certain times but are produced at others. From this one can infer the presence of another cause which is time. Though it is a permanent entity different from the functional things which exist in the three times, it is revealed in terms of instants, moments, brief spans, and so forth.-- Answer: This is unacceptable, for if time were an entity different from functional things it should be perceived but it is not perceived. That has already been refuted. In this context the refutation is made taking a future pot to represent future time. The same should be understood with respect to the other two times.-- It follows that the present pot does not exist in the future pot, nor does the past pot exist at that time, for if they both existed at that time, time would be disrupted, since things which are to occur later would already exist at an earlier time. Also at any one time another cannot exist. For these reasons, since both the past and present would be future if they existed at the time of the future pot, they do not already exist at that time. If the future of the future existed by way of its own entity, it should be future. In that case since all three times would have to be future, there could not be any past or present. If that were so, the future itself would not exist, since it could not be posited as future in relation to anything.).L6: [b.

Since there is a part of it which has not yet come into existence as an entity that has occurred, there is no error.-- Answer: If at the time of the future pot, the disintegrated pot existed in the future as an entity which had not yet come into existence, it would follow that the pot was future because of being, by way of its own entity, that which had not yet occurred at the time of the future pot. If this is accepted, it follows that there would be no past. This would necessarily be so, for how could anything that truly existed as future in nature become past? It is contradictory. Moreover by virtue of this reasoning, if the future relation to the pot is asserted as truly existent it must be accepted as being only future, which undermines the contention.).L6: [c.

It is false to pretend that one can see the future as if really existing now. But still this doesn't mean that the future is completely non-existent either. A Buddha can directly see their real non-dual nature: the beginningless chain of causes, and the endless chain of effects. A flow of interdependence without any inherently existing entities in it.).( -- Assertion: The future exist because there is Yogic perception of wished-for objects which focuses on future things, and because predictions concerning the future are later seen to turn out just as predicted. This is impossible in relation to a barren woman's child.-- Answer ab: If future things are directly perceived by way of their own entity in the period before their production, why are non-existent things not seen? It follows that they would be seen, for it is not feasible to make distinctions between what is seen and not seen with regard to the non-existent. Such fallacies arise for those who assert that the past and future exist by way of their own entity, but no fallacies accrue to us who assert the three times as arising dependently without inherent existence.Buddhas directly perceive in the present even those things which will occur after ten millions aeons. Though they are future at the time of the consciousness perceiving them, they are neither non-functional nor permanent for they will not remain for a second moment after their formation. There is no need for a Buddha to cognize the present explicitly and the past and future implicitly, for though the latter do not exist at that time, they are in general directly perceived. Similarly it is not contradictory for objects of aspiration, though they do not exist at that time, to appear clearly to Yogic perception of that which is wished for, just as a dream appears to be real.Even though the barley seed exists, the sprout which has not yet come into existence may be called future but the sprout itself must not be called future. An understanding of the other two times should be inferred from this. In our ownsystem we accept that Buddhas perceive all three times directly and not at all assert to trainees that they merely appear to do so.-- cd: Moreover there cannot be a distant time for a protagonist for whom the future exists by way of its own entity because the future exists in terms of its own entity.).L8: [(b) Consequence that fresh restraint from non-virtue and so forth are unnecessary if the future is substantially existent].\ ###\ 262.\ If virtue exists though nothing is done,\ Resolute restraint is meaningless.\ If even a little is done\ The effect cannot exist..(i.e. If the future already exist.

Liberation is beyond causality space and time. But, still, without a path combining the accumulation of merit and wisdom we will probably remain in samsara for an eternity.

We need both method and wisdom together all the time.).( -- According to Sautrantikas and so forth who assert that future functional things do not have the slightest existence, liberation will occur without any exertion to generate the paths of the Exalted in order to prevent future disturbing emotions and suffering, because future things do not exist. This would be like liberated Foe Destroyers for whom there are no future disturbing emotions and so forth and who thus do not need to exert themselves because of them.

For proponents of dependent arising free from inherent existence, there is no possibility of error and thus everything is properly established.In meditative equipoise the Exalted who are still learning do not perceive dependently arising phenomena as existent. Failure to distinguish between this non-perception and the perception of phenomena as non-existent, as well as inability to posit conventional valid cognition in one's own system, seem to give rise to numerous errors. One must therefore master the meaning of the establishment of the two truths by valid cognition in our own system.).L4: [C.

Such transformations are not perceived even by mental consciousness that engages with extremely subtle objects, let alone observed by the five kinds of sense consciousness. Although transformation with respect to the present and its causes is not observed, those who lack wisdom and are ignorant about the meaning of suchness consider the present truly existent.).L3: [II.

Since time may be investigated by considering functional things but not on its own, time is truly existent.-- Answer: How can functional things, the basis for time, be truly existent? It follows that they are not because of not having inherent duration. How could they have inherent duration, since they are continually consumed by impermanence?

If one does, the object of observation of a visual consciousness cannot act as object of observation for a subsequently arising consciousness. The sutra passage means that the visual consciousness cognizes the form clearly and the mental consciousness which is produced subsequently cognizes it in an unclear way.).L5: [2.

Memory focuses on an object which one has experienced.-- Though things seen previously do not reappear later, and though awareness observing objects belonging to a past rebirth does not occur again, memory arises with a sense of seeing as one sees present objects. Memory which is in fact mistaken and deceived arises in relation to a so-called remembered object which is false and deceptive like an optical illusion. However, we do not deny that memory focusing on past objects arises dependently. This is certainly accepted in our own system.).L3: [The summarizing stanza:] .\ ###\ Not knowing how to posit continuity and transitoriness,\ They say time is permanent and the three times exist substantially.\ Having understood that phenomena are like optical illusions,\ Learn how the three times are perceived..(i.e. There is no need for inherently existing time to support dependent origination / karma: Because we observe some regularity and continuity, and long to be able to control everything, we assume the inherent existence of causes, effects, space and time as if objectively existing. We think dependent origination implies inherent existence. But, on the contrary, dependent origination implies emptiness of inherent existence, and vice versa. Causes, effects, space and time are not inherently existing, not completely non-existing, not both, not neither.

Prerequisite qualities of the listener].\ ###\ 276.\ An unprejudiced, intelligent and interested\ Listener is called a vessel.\ Neither the teacher's nor the student's\ Good qualities will be taken as faults..(i.e. Prerequisites: Not everybody is receptive enough at first. Many find faults in the teachings because they are conditioned by their own accumulated karma. One has to be open-minded, intelligent and interested.).(-- The twelfth chapter begins by examining what qualities make one an ideal recipient for explanations concerning emptiness. Only benefit ensues for both student and teacher when the nature of reality is explained to such a person, while in the absence of these qualities the consequences may be grave.-- The ideal recipient for instruction on emptiness is therefore open-minded, intelligent and interested.-- Question: even though you have explained selflessness very clearly and extensively and the Tathagata fully understood and gave instruction on it, why do most people not follow this teaching?-- Answer: Although the one who formulated it and those who elucidate it may be the perfect embodiment of greatness, a listener with great qualities is extremely hard to find.-- What qualities does one need?-- Answer: One should be unprejudiced, without attachment to one's own position or aversion to others' positions. Heart of the Middle Way says:~ One will never know peace~ While prejudice afflicts the mind.-- If one is not unprejudiced one will fail to understand a good explanation because of thinking it is someone else's. One must have the intelligence to distinguish between good and bad explanations, otherwise one may reject correct explanations and adopt incorrect ones. A keen interest in good explanations is needed, for without that one will make no effort and simply be like the lifeless picture of a human being. One should appreciate and be attentive to the teaching and the teacher. A listener with these five qualities is said to be a vessel for the teaching. Someone with all these attributes will recognize the teacher's good qualities and fully understand the clarity and orderliness of the teaching, as well as the good intentions of other listeners. The teacher's lack of self-interest and the like will not be seen as faults and other than as they are, but only as virtues. Nor will the good qualities of the listeners be construed as faults.).L5: [2.

He taught about true paths, the means to peace, such as the eightfold path of the Exalted, and also about peace, liberation and nirvana. He taught the four noble truths for those who seek liberation, but ordinary people who make no effort to hear, think and meditate are unaware that they do not possess all the qualities of a suitable vessel. Whatever they fail to understand correctly, they see as the Subduer's fault, saying he did not explain it in sufficient detail. However, merely that does not mean the Teacher is to blame. A blind person's inability to see is not the sun's fault.).45 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]L5: [3.

Why do they dislike it when the person and aggregates are said to be empty of existence by way of their own entities? The understanding of this destroys all that is associated with disturbing emotions. Therefore they should be glad. Sutra says:~ In nirvana there are no phenomena.~ Whatever does not exist then never existed.~ The suffering of those with ideas of existence and non-existence~ Who act accordingly will not be pacified..Since only the Buddha's words contain undistorted statements about suchness, and Samkhyas and so forth do not make even the slightest mention of it, one should recognize it as a unique teaching.).L7: [(2) Why there is no liberation in any teaching other than the Teacher's].\ ###\ 279.\ How will one who does not know\ The means to give it up, do so?\ Certainly, therefore, the Subduer said\ There is no peace in any other [teaching]..(i.e. It is not about artificially dropping all, but about directly seeing the real nature of everything: They do not know how to drop all attachments; they have no methods. It only by directly seeing the real nature of our own mind, and thus of everything, that all attachments and fears are automatically dropped. It is not by artificially trying to drop them all that one attain Nirvana. Nirvana is not produced by doing this or not doing that, by getting this or dropping that; it is beyond causality space and time.).(-- Question: If these strange people all agree that one attains nirvana by giving up everything, what difference is there between you and the Forders?-- Answer: They are different in that they merely have the wish to give everything up but do not know how to do so.-- How can those belonging to other systems give up cyclic existence while they cling to the wrong methods? They do not know that the means to give it up is to understand that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence. Therefore certainly with this in mind the Subduer said, "The first practitioner of virtue has come about thus. The second and third have come about thus. The fourth has come about thus. Others' doctrines lack such practitioners of virtue." On account of this he said, "There is no peace in any teaching other than this.").L7: [(3) Means to gain certainty regarding extremely hidden matters taught by the Teacher]46 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2].\ ###\ 280.\ Whoever doubts what the Buddha said\ About that which is hidden\ Should rely on emptiness\ And gain conviction in him alone..(i.e. Gradually gaining confidence and faith in this Buddha's teachings can be done first by understanding intellectually the importance and efficacity of realizing the emptiness of all dharmas in the elimination of all causes of suffering. One also realize then that a mere intellectual understanding is not enough to actualize Nirvana, but one has to directly see this truth in his own mind in action in the present.).(-- It is thus vital to gain conviction in the importance and efficacity of understanding emptiness.-- Question: If he is omniscient, he must have super-knowledge of hidden things such as the size of Mount Meru and the continents, but how can one be sure of that?-- Answer: One can ascertain it with the help of inference.-- One might wonder whether what the Buddha has said is true or not regarding the size of the abodes, bodies and lifespans of the six kinds of gods of the Desire Realm and so forth from whom one is separated by time and place, and regarding the size of the human physical world and so on, all of which are hidden to common beings. To dispel such doubts one should take as example the fact that the feature of the two truths which are very subtle and difficult to understand -- the teaching that all phenomena are empty of inherent existence together with the feasibility of all actions and agents -- are actually as he explained. Understanding through this that the extremely hidden things he taught are just as he described, one should gain conviction that he alone is omniscient. Having ascertained dependent arising free from fabricated extremes through correct reasoning without relying on scriptural citations as proof, one should ascertain extremely hidden things relying on the Buddha's words as reason. Regarding the general presentation of this, the explanations of Dignaga and his spiritual son are like those of the great trailblazers. In this context objects can be understood through the presentation of four kinds of valid cognition.).L6: [b.

Why some, although seeking liberation, follow the Forders].\ ###\ 282.\ The unwise take no delight in letting\ Their mind follow a guide\ Who has done that which is\ Most difficult -- attained nirvana.47 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2].(i.e. Lack of interest: Because they do not find short term gratification for their self, and fear emptiness. See next verse.).(-- Lack of interest prevents one from finding out how to gain liberation and from following what was explained by the Buddha who taught from his own experience.-- Question: Why do those who seek liberation follow the Forders?-- Answer: Because they are afraid to listen to teaching on emptiness. It is as follows: "the four lines of this verse".-- To be taken care by a spiritual friend and go to the city of Nirvana, having rid oneself of the stains of conceiving things as truly existent, is very difficult. Though one with great compassion who did what was difficult to do has come to guide them, unwise people take no delight in letting their minds follow this guide because they fear emptiness.).L6: [b. Recognizing a person who fears emptiness].\ ###\ 283.\ When it is not seen, fear does not begin.\ When seen, it stops completely.\ Thus one can say with certainty;\ Those who know a little are afraid..(i.e. Fear of emptiness: They fear because they know a little, but not enough, about emptiness.).(-- Ingrained ideas about the self prevent ordinary people from considering the possibility of emptiness and cause them to fear it.-- Question: Who is afraid?-- Answer: People like cowherds, who see neither virtues not faults in it, can hear about emptiness a hundred times without beginning to feel afraid, because they do not regard it as either beneficial or harmful. When one perceives emptiness directly through a gradual process of hearing, thinking and meditating, fear stops completely because one is free from conceptions of a self which are the cause of fear. Thus one can say with certainty that fear arises in people who have only a little knowledge of emptiness. It is like the following analogy: A well-trained person is not afraid to mount a mad elephant, nor is an extremely stupid person. Yet someone who knows a little about the dangers and benefits involved feels frightened.).L6: [c. Why childish people fear emptiness].\ ###\ 284.\ Childish beings are certainly only\ Familiar with that which involves them.\ Because of unfamiliarity\ They fear that which extricates them..(i.e. All of this because of unfamiliarity with emptiness: It is a childish reaction due to unfamiliarity with emptiness).(-- Question: Why do they fear emptiness?-- Answer: Because of a lack of familiarity.--- Childish beings are certainly only familiar with innate and intellectually formed conception of a self which involve them in cyclic existence. Since such childish beings have no previous familiarity with a teaching that extricates one from the cycle of birth and death, they fear emptiness. One should therefore give up doctrines that are wrong and unwholesome.-- Emptiness should be taught to those who, because they feel grateful to the Tathagata, are suitable vessels, but who, because of their great fear, are tempted to reject it.).L5: [2.

This being so, what chance is there of such a person attaining liberation, since such actions are grave ill deeds? Rejecting dependent arising free from fabricated extremes is a more serious ill deed than killing a hundred million people, so one must take care in this matter to avoid deceiving oneself.).L5: [3. Taking care to lapse from the view of suchness].\ ###\ 286.\ Lapsing from ethics is preferable\ To lapsing from the view.\ Through ethics one gains a high rebirth;\ The supreme state is reached by means of the view..(i.e. Even if only emptiness is the final antidote: But, ultimately, only the wisdom realizing the emptiness of all dharmas is the final antidote to all karma formation and sufferings. All other methods can only create merit and better rebirth conditions; but we are still stuck in samsara. It is always necessary to combine wisdom to any method.).(-- Since denying emptiness is most detrimental to oneself and others, a lapse in ethical conducts is preferable. One should never lapse from the view of emptiness, for while the result of ethical conduct is a high rebirth, the view that understands emptiness takes one to the supreme states of liberation and enlightenment. Sutra says:~ A lapse in ethics is preferable;~ A lapse in view is not.) .L5: [4.

It is also said:~ Taught to fools, it confuses them~ And does not further peace.~ When snakes drink milk~ Their poison only increases.-- It is best to teach the uneducated and unreceptive that there is a self in accordance with their conceptions of a self, for their attachment to the self will cause them to give up harmful behavior, making it easier for them to find a happy rebirth. It is not good to teach them emptiness, for they will ruin their three doors by rejecting or misunderstanding it. Thus teaching emptiness has a disadvantageous as well as an advantageous aspect. On the one hand, rejecting it through lack of appreciation or denying cause and effect because of taking non-existence to be the meaning of emptiness leads49 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]to a bad rebirth.

Dependent arising's lack of inherent existence is called the fundamental mode of existence, ultimate truth, emptiness and selflessness, and is the object of Hearer and Solitary Realizer Exalted one and of all Exalted Buddhas.

Nonetheless this teaching of emptiness burns up others' wrong contentions just as fire consumes its fuel without formulation the intention to burn. The Master also says:~ Like the dew on the tips of the grass~ When it meets with the rays of the sun,~ Opponents' arguments and errors~ Evaporate when they meet you.) .L5: [2. Why this is so] L6: [a. Actual meaning].\ ###\ 291.\ Whoever knows this teaching\ Will not relish others.\ Thus to me this teaching seems\ Like the door to destruction..(i.e. Emptiness is merely the antidote to any view, to inherent existence: It destroys all other views because they are all based on the inherent existence of something or another. By realizing the real nature of anything, its dependence and lack of inherent existence, one automatically drop any attachment or fears associated with it. Ultimately all views are seen as flawed, or not absolute; but still can be used when appropriate as adapted skillful means.).( -- Question: How does this teaching burn up others' contentions, when understanding of it arises in the mind of someone with interest in it?-- Answer: Whoever comes to know the nectar-like taste of this teaching, the emptiness of inherent existence, through hearing, thinking and meditating will not relish views adhering to the true existence of things. The Master Aryadeva therefore says that this teaching of emptiness seems to him like the door and means to the destruction of wrong views. Alternatively he says it with texts on emptiness in mind, in that the words of the Buddha that teach emptiness also seem like this to the Master.).L6: [b. Why the Exalted do not experience fear].\ ###\ 292.\ For those who think there is\ In reality no self and abide in this thought,\ How will existence cause pleasure\ Or non-existence cause fear?.(i.e. No more cause for attachments and fears: By realizing the real nature of anything, its dependence and lack of inherent existence, one automatically drop any attachment or fears associated with it.).( -- Question: Why does emptiness not cause the Exalted fear?-- Answer: Because they have destroyed the seed of attachment to the self.-- Since they have no attachment to views of a self or hostility toward selflessness, how will those who think that external and internal phenomena are in reality selfless and who abide in a direct understanding of this be pleased by the existence of the self or frightened by selflessness? Fear therefore does not arise in those who have direct understanding of selflessness because they have eliminated the cause of fear.).L5: [3.

Seeing this and knowing the nature of these teachings, who with a Bodhisattva's disposition would not feel pity for those who long for a teaching that will liberate them from cyclic existence? Therefore one must show sentient beings the path of non-inherent existence so that they will not be ravaged by the Forders' snakes.).L4: [D.

But Liberation cannot be produced by any of those superficial methods alone. It is only through realizing the very subtle nature of everything that one can be truly Liberated from the whole cycle of samsara. On the other hand, to be able to appreciate this one needs to have already accumulated enough merit through virtuous methods.).(-- Since emptiness is difficult to understand, and since the transformation of one's attitude, the focus of Buddhist practice, is hard to achieve, many people choose physical and verbal forms of practice by which they hope to attain liberation.-- Question: Why, despite their inclination toward virtue, do people mostly follow Forders' systems and not the Buddha's teaching?-- Answer: Since the teaching of the Sakyas, the Nirgranthas and Brahmins is understood by the mind, the eyes and the ears respectively, the Subduer's textual system is more subtle and thus most people do not follow it. The sun-like view, the understanding of non-inherent existence, is said to illuminate one's mindstream. It destroys all the thickets of unwholesome views. Seeing all products as being like dreams makes one's mindstream stainless. All this must be understood through meditative equipoise, and thus the Sakyas's teaching is subtle. Since the practices of Nirgranthas consist of a lack of hygiene and physical pain caused by the sun and wind, they can be understood by merely seeing them, and since Brahmins take recitation alone as the essence of their practice, it can be understood by hearing it. These are therefore easier to comprehend.).L5: [2. Specific explanation]L6: [a. Those seeking liberation should not try these systems] .\ ###\ 295.\ Brahmin practices are said\ Mainly to be an outward show.\ The practices of Nirgranthas\ Are said to be mainly stultifying..(i.e. Most of these methods are not even wholesome enough, or creating enough merit, because they are just for the benefits of the appearances and of the ego. Instead of helping to diminish the ego and the illusions, they amplify them.) .52 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2](-- Assertion: If ordinary people engage in outsiders' practices because they may be perceived by coarse forms of awareness, it is right for you to do so too.-- Answer: Since most Brahmin practices such as recitation, burnt offerings, auspicious incantation, repentance, confession and so forth are mainly an outward show for the sake of reward and respect, it is said that they should not be performed by those who seek liberation. Similarly it is said that most of the Nirgranthas' practices, such as allowing their hair to become matted and employing the five fires, are stultifying. Therefore those who seek liberation should avoid them completely.).L6: [b.

Thus some unintelligent people revere Brahmins because they adopt orthodox practices such as reciting the Vedas ad so forth. They revere and pity Nirgranthas because they adopt painful and deluded forms of behavior such as mortifying the body through sun and wind.).L6: [c. Why those systems are not excellent teaching].\ ###\ 297.\ Suffering is a maturation\ And thus is not virtuous.\ Similarly, birth too is not virtuous,\ Being a maturation of actions..(i.e. No method alone can produce Liberation from samsara: Liberation is not about ascetic practices or Brahmin's views. It is not about doing this or not doing that, getting this or dropping that. All choices are karma formation, all discrimination are based on ignorance. All methods, wholesome or unwholesome actions, are all creating more causes for suffering. Without wisdom they are all bondage. The only way out of samsara is by realizing the real nature of this cycle, the real nature of everything.).(-- Painful sensations such as mortification of the body are not virtuous but are instead, like the suffering in the hells, the maturation of non-virtuous actions. Similarly, because it is a maturation of past actions as are eyes and so forth, birth as a Brahmin is not something virtuous enabling the attainment of liberation.)L3: [II. Exposition of good explanation in brief] L4: [A. Actual meaning].\ ###\ 298.\ In brief Tathagatas explain\ VIRTUE AS NON-VIOLENCE\ And EMPTINESS AS NIRVANA --\ Here there are only these two..(i.e. The Middle Way: What we need is both virtuous methods based on non-violence that diminish the importance of the ego and of the illusions (like morality, patience, love, compassion, bodhicitta) and wisdom based on emptiness. One is the accumulation of merit, the other the accumulation of wisdom. But, using only methods (dependent origination) is not enough. And using only wisdom (emptiness) is not enough. We need both method and wisdom together all the time,53 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]because only then are we more and more in accord with the real non-dual nature of everything, with the inseparability of the Two Truths. Only this kind of path can lead to total Enlightenment.).(-- Although non-violence and emptiness are the salient principles of the Buddha's teaching and the only way by which a good rebirth and liberation can be attained, attachment to their own particular religious practices and views prevents people from adopting what the Buddha taught.-- Question: If birth and suffering are not virtuous, what is?-- Answer: Harmful thoughts toward others as well as physical and verbal actions thus motivated constitute violence toward others. Non-violence is the opposite of this, namely the ten virtuous paths of action.-- In brief Tathagatas say that the principle through which one attains a high rebirth is non-violence. The principle through which liberation is attained is natural nirvana, the emptiness of inherent existence of all phenomena. By directly experiencing this and recognizing that suffering will never arise again, there is separation from adventitious stains -- the nirvana of separation from adventitious stains. Here [in this system] there are only these two."Sixty Stanzas of Reasoning" says:~ When reality is seen~ Nirvana is attained; the task is accomplished..It is posited that having reached the path of seeing one attains mere nirvana. To attain this, all the aggregates do not have to cease. The reason for explaining this here is to show that one definitely needs to understand emptiness to attain liberation.).L4: [B.

In short people are stuck with their own accumulated conditioning, their own karma; they can't even see what is good for them.).(-- Question: When outsiders are aware of the Subduer's teaching, why do they not appreciate these two principles?-- Answer: Because they are attached to their own mistaken positions.-- Attachment to their own position is something ordinary people have been accustomed to since beginningless time. Like their birthplace they find it attractive and do not want to give it up because of their attachment. Why would you outsiders find attractive these two principles which preclude and are contrary to your own position? You do not follow the Buddha's teaching because you cling to your own wrong views.)L3: [III.

Actual meaning]L7: [(1) Refuting that a sense consciousness directly perceivesa pot existing by way of its own character].\ ###\ 301.\ When seeing its form, one does not in fact\ See the whole pot. Who that knows\ Reality would claim that the pot\ Is DIRECTLY PERCEPTIBLE also?.(i.e. Direct perception is impossible: otherwise we would perceive all of it, and there could be no mistake. There is no objective perception of an object; we only perceive part of it and make up for the rest. This also applies to the parts. We only perceive stimuli, compare them to memory and extrapolate the rest.).(-- We feel that since objects are directly perceptible they must have true existence. In that case we should see every aspect of an object, such as a pot, at once. A pot, however, consists of many diverse elements of which visual perception apprehends only one, its visual form. Yet this visual form too has its specific components. Therefore the pot and its constituents are merely imputed to a collection of components and do not exist in and of themselves as directly perceptible objects-- Question: When it says [in stanza 300]:~ The intelligent who seek what is good~ Adopt what is worthwhile even from others.what is this good explanation?-- Answer: It is about seeing that all phenomena have no inherent existence.-- Assertion: It is impossible to cognize that all phenomena have no inherent existence, for if they would be totally non- existent like the horns of a donkey and so forth, and would not be directly perceptible. However, since a pot and blue are directly perceptible, all functional thing are in fact inherently existent.-- Answer: It follow that direct perception of a pot which exists by way of its own entity is not feasible. If it were, the awareness perceiving the visible form of the pot should perceive all its parts. Yet when visual consciousness perceives the pot's form, it does not in fact perceive every single part of the pot. Who that knows the reality of things would claim that the pot is directly perceptible? "Also" refers to also blue existent by way of its own character.The pot is imputed in dependence on eight substances and therefore cannot exist by way of its own character, nor by seeing one part can one see all its parts. Similarly, if fire existed by way of its own entity, the fallacy that it should always keep burning would arise, since it would not require fuel.Dialecticians contradict both reasoning and common knowledge when they call awareness arising in dependence upon an individual sense organ direct perception, and assert that an awareness free from conceptuality in which a sound image and a generic image may be apprehended as merged is direct perception. Each individual moment of consciousness cannot be a direct perceiver. In the world objects like the waxing moon which are directly perceived by many people, are commonly held to be directly perceptible, whereas that which perceives these objects is not. Furthermore since they assert that sense consciousness is a direct perceiver, it is inconsistent to think that it is also a valid perceiver. An extensive explanation of this may be found in Candrakirti's commentary. it has not been included here for fear that it would be too long.).56 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]L7: [(2) Applying this reasoning to other instances].\ ###\ 302.\ By means of this very analysis\ Those with superior intelligence\ Should refute individuality\ All that is fragrant, sweet and soft..(i.e. This applies to all five senses; there is no direct perception, no objective perception.).(-- This same analogy procedure should be applied to the objects of the other senses: to sounds, smells, tastes and tactile objects. One will discover that none of these are truly existent directly perceptible objects.-- By means of this very analysis using the reasoning which refutes the assertion that sense consciousness is a direct perceiver in relation to a pot, blue and so forth, existent by way of their own entity, the wise with superior intelligence refute separately in each case the contention that sense consciousnesses are direct perceivers in relation to fragrances such as the fragrance of jasmine flowers, sweet tastes and that which is soft to touch, all existent by way of their own entity. Since one cannot make distinction such as seeing one part but not seeing others, or distinctions with regard to what touches and what does not, or with regard to closeness and distant in relation to truly existent functional things, such fallacies ensue.).L7: [(3) Absurdity of positing that other parts are seen because visible form existent by way of its own character is seen].\ ###\ 303.\ If because the form is seen\ Everything is seen,\ Why because of what is not seen\ Would the form not be unseen?.(i.e. We perceive only part of it.).(-- Assertion: All parts of the pot are seen when its visual form is seen, for the pot is not a separate entity from its visual form.-- Answer: If on the grounds that visual consciousness sees the pot's form one can posit that all parts of the pot are seen, why on the grounds that visual consciousness does not perceive the pot's smell would even the visible form, which is accepted as seen, not be unseen?

There is not the slightest thing existent by way of its own entity that is directly perceptible to any kind of awareness.)57 / 117.Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]L7: [(5) Showing that the proof and what is to be proved are alike].\ ###\ 305.\ This also applies when one examines\ Whether particles have parts or not.\ Thus to prove a thesis by that\ Which must be proved is not feasible..(i.e. And we cannot conclude that the form exist because we see the particles composing it because this is not proven. In fact the same argument about seeing only a part of it also applies to particles.).(... even particles, have parts.-- When all the parts are separated, that form is finally reduced to the smallest particles. An investigation of whether particles have parts or not applies to those particles too. If they have parts like a front and a back, they are, like the pot, imputed in dependence upon many parts, in which case they no longer are the smallest particles. If they do not have parts, they cannot exist because of being inapprehensible. Thus it is not feasible to prove that the pot exists by way of its entity as a directly perceptible object of comprehension by means of that which must be proved, for things do not exist by way of their own character.).L7: [(6) Showing other lines of reasoning].\ ###\ 306.\ EVERYTHING TOO IS A COMPONENT\ AS WELL AS BEING A COMPOSITE.\ Thus even a spoken syllable\ Does not have existence here..(i.e. Everything is empty because everything is composed of parts, and there is no direct perception because we seeonly part of any object - we assume the rest. And this applies to the parts, ...Everything is empty of inherent existence because dependent on its parts. That is how perception works: we receive stimuli based on an endless flow of interdependence, and through habituation we imagine invariants (entities ...) in it in our attempt to try to control it. But all those objects, characteristics, relations, are mere hypothesis, created by our own mind and by conventions. We just forget that they are our own fabrications and think they exist by themselves independently of our own mind out there. Everything is merely imputed by the mind.).(-- Thus each is simultaneously a component as well as a composite.-- Moreover when objects apprehended by the physical sense organs are examined, all are components in relation to their composites as well as composites in relation to their components and are therefore merely imputed in dependence upon their parts. As with the analysis of the smallest particle, names, which are ultimately reduced to spoken syllables such as "a," are also just conventions in this world and do not exist by way of their own entity. Thus you must recognize all dependently arising phenomena as mere names and terms.).L5: [2. Individual refutations]L6: [a.

Even (parts like) shape and colors are not inherently existing characteristics, independent of anything else, and directly perceptible as if truly existent on their own out there. Here it is proven that shape and color are not two, not one; they are interdependent, thus not existing on their own, not inherently existing. Those characteristics are also dependent on many many other factors. So we first receive stimuli (part of parts), compare them to memory, filter them through accumulated karma, and assume the rest like shape and colors, and then label the object, and then we have the illusion of perceiving the object as if it truly exist on its own. All the possible mistakes (optical illusions, color change due to other factors, miss-identification ...), proves that there is no objective perception of anything.).(-- Assertion: The pot is directly perceptible since visual consciousness sees the pot's visible form existent by way of its own character, consisting of color and shape.-- Answer: Are color and shape inherently one or distinct? If shape such as length and so forth is inherently distinct from color, how can a visual consciousness take shape as its object of apprehension? It follows that it cannot because shape is an entity distinct from color. Alternatively, if they are not distinct but inherently one, why does touch not apprehend color in the dark just as it apprehends shape? It follows that it should because they are one.).L9: [b: Refutation through the consequence that because the elements are present, a visual consciousness taking a visible form as its object would apprehend both].\ ###\ 308.\ Only the form is visible\ But the form's causes are not seen.\ If indeed it is thus,\ Why are both not also\ Perceived by just the eyes?.(i.e. Even parts like the so called elementary components are not inherently existing, or directly perceived: We cannot use the assumption of the elementary components to prove that a form really exist on its own. This is circular reasoning; they are assume based on the resulting form. Those elementary components have not been proven to exist on their own. In fact it is easy to prove that they could not exist as such as done in a previous chapter.).(-- An analysis of the relationship between the four elements and their outcome, visual form, is then made to demonstrate that they are neither inherently one nor different.-- Assertion: The visible form source exists because the four great elements which are causal forms exist.-- Answer ab: Only the resultant form is visible but the form's causes such as the earth element are not seen. Since causal form is imputed in dependence upon resultant form, they cannot be inherently different. If they are inherently one, they must be one.-- cde: In that case why does just visual consciousness itself not apprehend both the causal and resultant forms?

So we cannot say we have direct perception of a form because we directly perceive those elementary components.).59 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]( -- Earth is seen as firm and stable and furthermore is apprehended by tactile consciousness. Thus only that which is tangible is referred to as earth. Therefore since visible forms are objects apprehended by visual consciousness and the four elements are objects apprehended by tactile consciousness, they are different. If one accepts them as truly existent, they are unrelated. It would thereby follow that visible form is causeless.).L9: [2: Refuting contentions of other sectarians].\ ###\ 310.\ Since it was produced as something visible,\ It is of no use at all to the pot.\ As with the production of visibility,\ It lacks even the entity of existence..(i.e. The case of the "visibility" characteristic: And "visibility" is not another directly perceptible, inherently existing elementary characteristic. This characteristic is also dependently arisen.).(-- Vaisesika assertion: A pot is not visible by way of its own entity but neither is it not a visible object, since it is directly perceptible by virtue of possessing visibility, a separate generality.-- Answer ab: This too is unacceptable. Has the pot come into existence as something visible through its own causes or not? In the first case it would follow that an association with the separate generality of visibility is of no use in making the pot directly perceptible, because it has come into existence as something visible through its own causes. For this reason the generality of visibility is not produced in relation to the pot.-- cd: Further, a pot that has no connection with visibility and is not something visible lacks any inherently established entity of existence.

The eye is also composed of parts, dependent on multiple factors, the fruit of evolution or accumulated karma. It is not a perfect organ capable of true objective perception, of direct perception. All of its mistakes are proof of that. As everything is samsara it is based on mistaken assumptions, illusions, ignorance and accumulated karma. The emptiness of the sense organs, and of the objects of the senses, doesn't mean that they are completely non-existent, it only means that they are dependently arisen, not independent, not existing on their own. Emptiness doesn't deny dependent origination; one implies the other.).(-- The sense and the process of perception are examined next. Confusing lack of true existence with total non- existence, the opponent argues that the Madhyamika presentation of the senses contradicts what was said by the Buddha about the eyes and so forth being the maturation of past actions. In answer it is established that although nothing can sustain ultimate analysis, since nothing is findable when subjected to this kind of investigation, our experience confirms the existence of our senses and other phenomena. Thus the Buddha's statements about the relationship between actions and their effects are in no way contradicted, since such statements refer to the conventional existence of actions and their effects.-- Assertion: Because sense organs exist -- such as the eyes, which are instruments of perception -- directly perceptible objects such as visible exist.-- Answer ab: Regarding the subject, the eye organ: since the eye perceives visual stimuli while other senses do not, it does not perceive visual form by way of its own entity, for like the nose sense organ it is an outcome of the elements.

Thus recognizing that the maturation of actions is inconceivable, one should accept it without applying analysis by reasoning. Certainly therefore the Subduer said that the fruition of actions is inconceivable.

Alternatively if it exist after looking at the form, it follows that the eye consciousness is of no use in looking at the form, because looking takes place before it exists. As a third possibility one might think that that which looks and consciousness are simultaneous.

Since it cannot relinquish its nature even in relation to itself, if it is an instrument of looking by way of its own entity, why does the eye not perceive itself? It follows that it should since the eye organ even with the eye as its object cannot give up its nature as an instrument of looking. Yet valid cognition negates that the eye perceives itself. Thus the subject, the eye, is not an instrument of looking at form by way of its own entity, because it does not look at itself.).L9: [5: Refuting a combination of three factors as the instrument of looking at visible form].\ ###\ 317.\ The eye does not have consciousness\ And consciousness lacks that which looks.62 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]\ If form has neither of these,\ How can they see form?.(i.e. The theory of the contact between the three: the sense organ, the object perceived, and the consciousness of a sense, doesn't make sense when looked at in details.

Likewise that which perceives the exclusive aspects of an object, a mental factor positing the exclusive signs of all phenomena is called the aggregate of recognition.

Those two - dependent origination and emptiness - are not in real opposition, separate, different, nor are they one.

There is no direct perception of anything. All perceptions are dependent on accumulated karma. Everything in samsara is like an illusion. -- Our goal is to follow a gradual path of more and more subtle methods and wisdom that will permit us to directly realize the real nature of the objects of the three realms, and their inseparability. This threesome purification of our body, speech and mind is what can lead us to the inseparable trikaya of a Buddha. Once we directly realize the real non-dual nature of our own mind, and thus of everything in the three realms, then automatically all attachments and fears are dropped off, no more karma is produced and we are free from any accumulated karma because we see its real nature.

There is no exception at all - not even for the permanent basic elements described in the Abhidharma, not even for karma, dependent origination or emptiness itself, not even for the Buddha-nature, not even for the a primary awareness. Dependently arisen means dependent on its causes and conditions, on its parts or characteristics, on the mind perceiving or labeling it, on accumulated karma. Empty of inherent existence doesn't mean complete non-existence; that would be jumping to the other extreme: nihilism. Nor does it mean both existence and non-existence together (dualism), nor neither existence nor non-existence (monism). Everything is merely imputed by the mind, but still not from the mind only. The Middle Way between all extremes consists of staying away from all extreme conceptions, thinking that any view is the absolute final truth, or rejecting them all thinking they are all useless (that is also an extreme).).(-- The fourteenth chapter continues by refuting extreme conceptions of reified existence and total non-existence. If phenomena were inherently existent, they should be independent and findable when sought by a reasoning consciousness analyzing their final mode of existence, but they are neither. Emphasis is placed on the fact that ultimate or inherent existence is being refuted, and that this should not be misinterpreted to mean that things do not have valid conventional existence. The reason of not being inherently one or many is first presented concisely and then applied to refute non-Buddhist as well as Buddhist contentions, in order to establish that neither what is imputed nor its basis of imputation has true existence.-- Question: If, like the ring formed by a firebrand and so forth, worldly existence, because of being dependent arising, does not exist inherently, what has inherent existence?-- Answer: Not the slightest thing has inherent existence.-- Anything existing by way of its own entity would not rely on anything else at all, but not the least thing is independent or exists without relying on something else. If anything existed inherently, independence would be established as its nature when examined by the reasoning which investigates the ultimate, yet this does not exist anywhere. A mode of existence of phenomena not merely posited by nominal convention is known as independent existence, existence by way of their entity, existence by way of their character, inherent existence and true existence. This clearly indicates the object of negation through whose refutation there is no focus for conceptions of true existence. Since Candrakirti's commentary repeatedly mentions qualifying the object of negation when refuting fabrications of true existence, one should not deprecate the Madhyamika view.).L4: [B.

By analyzing the relations between the object and its characteristics with these assumptions we find that it turns into complete absurdity. Taking the pot and its form as example, we find that a pot cannot first exist on its own and then have a form that could also exist on its own. Each of those two cannot exist without the other. But still they are not the same thing. One cannot possess the other. They are not different, not the same. They are interdependent. They are two co-dependently arisen concepts. So there is no inherently existing (independent) object or characteristics. Everything is dependently arisen, thus empty of inherent existence.).(The pot and the form, not one, not separate:-- The text first examine whether the pot and its constituents, like visual form, are inherently one or different. If they were inherently one, there should be a pot wherever there is a visual form. Alternatively, if the pot possessed visual form as something inherently different from itself, the two would be unrelated, and we should be able to see a pot without necessarily seeing its form.-- If the composite known as "pot" exists by way of its own entity, are the visible form and the pot one or different?-- In the first case it follows that the pot in the statement "The form is a pot" are not inherently one, otherwise there would be a pot wherever there was a visible form. One might think that the pot which is something distinct from visible form possessed form the way Devadatta possesses a cow, as something separate. However it follows that the pot which has form is not inherently separate from the form, otherwise it would be apprehensible independently of its form. The pot does not have form as something apart which depends upon it, nor does the form have a pot dependent upon it, like a dish and its contents, because neither exists inherently.).L6: [b.

Here, the relationship between a substantial entity (a pot) and its attributes and the relationship between one attribute and another are also investigated..According to Vaisesika contentions one would not be able to say that the pot exists because the pot and existence are inherently different and thus unrelated.-- Vaisesika assertion: Though the pot and its form are not different substantial entities, existence and the pot are. The pot is a substantial entity and is said to exist through its connection with the great generality "existence," which is something separate from it.-- Answer: Existence and the pot are seen to have the dissimilar characteristics of a generality and of a specific. It is not feasible for the pot to be a substantial entity which is separate from existence, for if it were, why would existence not be a separate entity from the pot? It follows that it would be.

But still they are not the same thing. One cannot possess the other. They are not different, not the same. They are interdependent. They are two co-dependently arisen concepts.

All empty but still dependently arisen and functional. That is the meaning of the inseparability of appearances and emptiness, the inseparability of the Two Truths, of dependent origination and emptiness.).(-- A pot comes into existence through causes which require their own causes.

Anything, therefore, that needs to rely on causes does not exist by way of its own entity. If it existed by way of its own entity, it follows that it would be causeless. This reasoning which refutes the existence of a pot by way of its own entity should be applied to all effects.).L8: [(b) Briefly refuting that though there are many components, the composite is a truly existent single unit].\ ###\ 339.\ Though they meet and come together\ Form cannot be smell.\ Therefore like the pot\ The composite cannot be one..(i.e. Emptiness can only produce emptiness - empty parts and characteristics can only define an empty whole: the parts and characteristics keep their own individual parts, characteristics and functions. They do not become "one and the same" with the whole. The whole and its parts, or characteristics, or causes and conditions, are not different or separate, but still not the same. Not two, but still not one. They are interdependent, co-dependently arisen concepts.).(-- When the components retain their own particular properties, how can their combination form a truly existent unit?-- Assertion: Though it has many components, the pot is a truly existent single unit.-- Answer: Though visible form, smell and so forth meet and combine, form cannot be smell, for things that create the composite do not give up their different characteristics. Though form, smell and so forth combine they do not have one nature. Thus just as the pot as a truly existent single unit was refuted by the words [in stanza 332],~ Because the pot is not separate from~ Its characteristics, it is not one,the composite too cannot be a truly existent single unit.) .L5: [2.

Thus fire is that which burns and the other three elements that which is burnt.Fire burns only fuel whose nature is the other three elements, yet hot fuel is fire and no longer fuel to be burnt. If it is not hot, since it is unrelated to fire how will it burn? Thus fuel independent of fire does not exist by way of its own entity and because of this, fire independent of fuel does not exist by way of its own entity either.).L6: [c.

When it is overpowered by fire, it grows hot and is that which is burnt.-- Answer: Even if fuel grows hot only when overpowered by fire, why is it not fire? It follows that it should be fire because it is hot and burns. Yet if fuel is not hot at the same time, it is implausible to claim that something else which is not hot is present in fire. In that case just heat divorced from the other three elements would be fire, but if one of the great elements does not exist the others cannot exist either. Moreover it contradicts the statement, "Things that arise simultaneously are reciprocal effects like the elements.").L6: [d.

Since it therefore would follow that uncaused fire exists, one should not assert a smallest substantial particles as do the Vaisesikas. If one admits that even the fire particle has fuel, for fear of the conclusion that it would otherwise be causeless, it follows that there is no single- natured particle since the other elements are certainly present in each particle.).L5: [3.

Nor do they have truly existent plurality for the very reason by which they are not truly single, since plurality comes about through an accumulation of single units. External and internal phenomena are not truly existent because they are neither one nor many. They are like reflections.).L6: [b.

Yet even in their system the smallest earth particle is threefold in that it has substantial entity, singleness and existence. Attributes have attributiveness, singleness and existence. By virtue of the fact that everything is threefold even in their system, just unaccompanied singleness does not exist. Thus precisely the same fallacies apply to them.).L5: [4.

Because there is no absolute view, only adapted skillful means. Nirvana is not about doing something or not doing something, getting something or dropping something, seeing something or not seeing something. Nirvana is like space. -- Another way to present it would be: staying away from the four extremes: thinking causes and effects are the same (self-causation), different or separate (other causation), ...-- Another way to present it would be to say: staying away from the four extremes: thinking parts and whole are the same, different or separate, both separate and the same, neither separate nor the same.-- Another way to present it would be to say: staying away from the four extremes: thinking characteristics and the characterized are the same, different or separate, both separate and the same, neither separate nor the same.-- Another way to present it would be to say: staying away from the four extremes: thinking the world and the mind are the same, different or separate, both separate and the same, neither separate nor the same ... etc.-- The same for the Two Truths, for dependent origination and emptiness, for appearances and emptiness, for body and mind, for stillness and occurrence, for samsara and Nirvana, ... etc. The same for any duality. For all dualities, all76 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]opposites, all relations: one side doesn't assimilate the other (one being true and the other false), not are they different or separate (both being true), nor are they the same (both being false). They are all non-dual: not two, not one. They are interdependent, inseparable. - This is the method to apply to all problems.-- All of these different form of presentation mean the same thing. All duality problems come down to the same problem of inherent existence. Resolving the problem of inherent existence (the perfection of the wisdom of emptiness) is solving the problem of all dualities, of all discriminations, of causality space and time, of the self vs the world, of the whole samsara (the perfection of the wisdom of dependent origination). And perfecting wisdom is to realize their inseparability. All problems comes from ignoring this real non-dual nature of everything. And Nirvana comes only from directly realizing this true non-dual nature of our own mind, and of everything, that is like luminous space - empty of inherent existence but still dependently arisen and functional, inseparability of appearances and emptiness, the perfect Union of The Two Truths. Realizing this emptiness, great compassion arises!).(-- Those who have mastered the art of employing the meaning of suchness always refute oneness, otherness, both and neither by applying the kinds of reasoning which refute the assertions-- of those like the Samkhyas who claim the effect exists at the time of the cause;-- of the Sautrantikas who assert that cause and effect truly exist but that the effect does not exist at the time of the cause;-- of the Nirgranthas who assert both existence and non-existence in that a thing is permanent in nature yet temporarily impermanent;-- and of those who assert that though things are substantially existent, they neither exist nor do not exist since they cannot be said to be this nor that.They apply the reasons previously explained in [stanza 265], "For those who assert effects exists ..."; the reason of dependent arising, the lack of being one or many, the diamond fragments reason and so forth.).L3: [II.

That is the way it is presented in the Abhidharma. But their inherent existence is not necessary to explain karma, dependent origination, the cycle of samsara and the possibility of Liberation (or any conventional truths like morality, laws, sciences). On the contrary they would inhibit any possibility of change, and this mistake still creates subtle grasping and suffering, thus keeping us in samsara. Everything is dependently arisen (dependent on causes and conditions, on parts and characteristics, on the mind and karma perceiving it or labeling it) and thus empty of inherent existence; everything is like an illusion; like a figure on a cloud, like a swirl at the surface of the ocean, merely labeled by the mind, but not from the mind only. And there is no reason to fear this because it doesn't mean complete non-existence, or nihilism. But this is very subtle, hard to understand and usually not presented to beginners as discussed above.).(-- Through inability to understand the continuum of things or the nature of composites correctly, they are thought to be permanent and truly existent. However their lack of true existence should not be confused with non-existence. Things are like magical illusions, in that they appear to exist and of themselves, but actually depend upon each other. Inherent existence implies permanence which precludes the coming into existence of things in dependence on other factors.-- Question: if things therefore do not have the slightest inherent existence, for what reason do those opponents hold that they are truly existent?-- Answer: Though there is no valid reason, in the case of a thing which lasts three days, they feel compelled to assert that whatever existed before must exist later. Functional things are said to be permanent when the continuum which is posited through imputation upon former, intermediate and later moments is misapprehended. Similarly when the composite is misapprehended, it is said that there are truly existent functional things. There seem to be even many adherents to the "Seven Treatises on Valid Cognition" who, through not knowing how to posit the composite and the continuum, follow outsiders.)77 / 117.Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]L3: [III.

It teaches that this is the only way to produce total Liberation, that grasping at the inherent existence of anything is still creating more causes for suffering. It teaches that cause and effect are interdependent; whole and parts are interdependent; characteristics and characterized are interdependent; even elementary particles are interdependent; that consciousnesses, sense organs, perception, and objects perceived are interdependent; that the whole world and the mind are interdependent; that everything is dependent on accumulated karma, and that ignoring this is the root cause of all suffering, while removing this ignorance is total Liberation.).( -- Question: We too accept that effects are not independent, so what is the difference?-- Answer: The difference is that you do not understand that dependent arising means mutual reliance.-- Since nothing is produced by way of its own entity, things do not assemble and come together to produce an effect unless there is an effect to produce. Since anything inherently existent would be permanent, it could not rely on an effect. Aggregation for the sake of an effect is not included within the perception of the Exalted during meditative equipoise which sees suchness, because it directly perceives the lack of inherent existence of things.)78 / 117.Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]L4: [B.

Grasping at any absolute, any view, any method, any path, is still grasping. But that doesn't mean we should drop everything right now.).(-- Only by understanding that things do not exist as perceived by conceptions of true or inherent existence can the seed of cyclic existence be destroyed. We should therefore make a great effort to develop a correct understanding of reality. -- One gains release from cyclic existence when deluded ignorance which conceives things as truly existent ends. This depends on understanding emptiness of inherent existence.-- The seed of worldly existence is the conception that phenomena are truly existent. Objects such as form are its sphere of activity.

Dependently originated phenomena cannot exist and then be empty of inherent existence. Nor can something empty exist and then be dependently originated. Each of those two cannot exist without the other. But still they are not the same thing. One cannot possess the other. They are not different, not the same. They are interdependent. They are two co-dependently arisen concepts. Thus both dependent origination and emptiness itself are also empty of inherent existence because dependently arisen. They are both conventional truths, even if emptiness is called the ultimate truth, or sacred truth. The real final truth is something else beyond any conceptualization. They are like two complementary antidotes, or skillful means. One fights nihilism or non-existence, the other fights realism or existence. This is the same thing as saying "we need both method and wisdom together all the time". - We cannot say what is the absolute truth beyond conceptualization (so we say there is no absolute truth, only adapted skillful means), but we can say what it is not; and it is not Dependent Origination (conventional truths), not emptiness (ultimate truth), not both together, not neither or something else that those two. That is how we stay away from the four extremes conceptions. The final truth is beyond conceptualization, it cannot be described and has to be directly seen, but it is called the Union of the Two Truths, the inseparability of appearances and emptiness, the perfection of dependent origination and of emptiness where one realize their non-duality: not two but still not one.).\ ###\ This is the fourteenth chapter from the Four Hundred on the Yogic Deeds, showing how to meditate on the refutation of extreme conceptions.79 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2].This concludes the commentary on the fourteenth chapter, showing how to meditate on the refutation of extreme conceptions, from Essence of Good Explanations, Explanation of the "Four Hundred on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas".80 / 117.Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2] L2: [Chapter 15 - Refuting Truly Existent Characteristics [of products] -Production / origination, duration, cessation - P.277](i.e. SHOWING HOW TO MEDITATE ON THE REFUTATION OF THAT WHICH CONSTITUTES PRODUCTS..-- Refuting the inherent existence of production, duration and disintegration, the characteristics of products.-- One of the argument used to assert the true existence of things is based on the supposedly objective observation of their production, duration and disappearance. It may also be assumed that things change into something else.-- But the exact link between the cause and conditions and the effect is not clear at all. They cannot overlap in time, nor be simultaneous in time. Why? Because they are both merely imputed by the mind. They are mental constructions, based on each other. So there is no stopping of the cause, and starting of the effect at all.-- There is no real production, and so forth, otherwise we would have infinite regress.-- When we say a thing is in the process of production; it is never absolute. Some conditions can change and there would be no final product as expected. So nothing is absolutely in the process of production; nothing is being produced. -- The process of production itself is unclear; it cannot be found.-- So the exact time of production cannot be found. And the distinction between past, present and future become blur. Why? Because there is no real production and so forth; it is merely labeled by the mind.-- So thing are not produced from other things, nor by themselves, nor from non-things, ... And things do not change.-- The three characteristics of impermanent things (the product) are not real characteristics either. They cannot exist independently of each other, and of the characterized. Nor are they all the same. Neither simultaneous, nor consecutive.-- In general, the characteristics and the characterized are not different, not the same. Why? Because they are both merely imputed by the mind. They are mental constructions, based on each other.-- So there is no real cause, production, product. There is no real impermanent things with origination, duration, cessation. Production cannot be used as an argument to prove the existence of things.-- Nothing is before, during or after production / change.-- There is no real past, present, future. Why? Because they are relative to the existence of something real, and nothing is real.-- But, still, there is no effect without a cause.).-- (Assumption: Things exist and change; they have origination, duration and cessation. Because there is this inherent production, things really exist.).L3: [I.

Thus how can anything which does not exist at the time of its cause be produced by way of its own entity? It cannot. How can anything which exist at the time of its cause be produced? It follows that it will not be produced, since anything existing at the time of its cause was produced from the outset, prior to being itself. The subject, a sprout, is not produced by way of its own entity, for neither that which exists at the time of its cause nor that which does not exist at the time of its cause is produced by way of its own entity.).L7: [(2) Establishing its mode [of operation]].\ ###\ 352.\ Since the effect destroys the cause,\ That which does not exist will not be produced.\ Nor will that which exists be produced\ Since what is established needs no establisher..(i.e. The cause and the effect cannot be sequential, not overlapping, because then there is no causal link between the two and it would mean that the effect is without any cause, that anything could be produced from anything else. The cause and the effect cannot overlap either because if the effect is already existing at the time of the cause what need is there to produce it again?).(-- Something non-existent at the time of its causes cannot come into being in and of itself. If it could, even totally non- existent things like rabbits' horns could occur, since they would not depend on producing causes. On the other hand, neither would something already existent at the time of its causes require anything to bring it into existence.-- ab: Since the sprout cannot be produced unless the seed undergoes change, the process which produces the resultant sprout destroys the causal seed. Thus something which does not exist at the time of the seed will not be produced by way of its own entity. In general, even though a sprout which is non-existent at the time of the seed is produced, it is incorrect to accept truly existent production, for then one must also accept production of rabbits' horns.-- cd: Since something which is established at the time of its cause does not need anything to establish it, that which exists at the time of its cause will not be produced.).L7: [(3) Refutation by examining the time of production].\ ###\ 353.\ There is no production at that time,\ Nor is there production at another.\ If not produced at that time nor another,\ When will there ever be production?.(i.e. There is no inherent production because the exact time of production cannot be found: At the time of the cause there is no production yet; at the time of the effect there is no more production. And since those two cannot overlap or be separated, then when exactly is there production ?).(-- A thing is not produced while it exists nor while it is non-existent. Since there is no other possibility, how can production be truly existent, for when analyzed nothing is findable.-- At a time when the sprout itself exists there is no production, since it does not need to be produced. Other than that, when it does not exist there is no production, since it cannot be produced. If it is not produced at that time nor at the other, when will there ever be production?

Neither is that milk produced as something else, i.e. curd, for the two are different entities.-- see Karikas 13 -- Nothing is being produced, and nothing is changing into something else. For example, when we say "milk changes into curds"; it is not milk that is curds, so milk has not changed. Like "milk becoming curd"; it is not "milk" existing as "curds". It is not the same continuing. It is about the duality "existence" vs "other-existence"; neither exist independently.).L6: [b.

To be inherently existing those three characteristics have to be able to exist independently, on their own. But they cannot exist before the product; they are dependent on a product. And they cannot exist independently of each other because a product need to have those three to be a product. They have no real existence on their own, they are empty of inherent existence because co-dependently arisen concepts. We would never be able to see them directly contrary to what the Abhidharma say the Yogis can do.).(-- Do the three characteristics -- production, duration and disintegration -- occur sequentially? They cannot, for they are simultaneous aspects of an on-going process, dependent on one another. Unless a thing has all three of these features, it cannot be a product.-- There is no inherent production for the following reason too:-- ab: First production, then duration and lastly disintegration are not possible prior to production, because that which is unproduced cannot have production, duration and disintegration.-- Assertion: Production while a thing is being produced, duration while it lasts and disintegration when it disintegrates exists consecutively by way of their own entity.-- cd: How could each at its particular time begin without the other two? Duration and disintegration are impossible without production. The same applies to the other two. Moreover a product is not feasible without any one of these characteristics.).L6: [c.

The clay does not exist by way of its own entity either, since it depends on pebbles. Thus the pot does not come into existence either from self or from other, for since neither self nor other exist by way of their own entity, there is no inherent production.).L6: [d.

The product and its production are two co-dependently arisen concepts..).(-- Since production, duration and disintegration cannot be found to exist before, simultaneously or after that which they characterize, they cannot exist inherently.-- Moreover there is no inherent production, since it is impossible to say that production and so forth exist before, after or simultaneously with the pot. Therefore the pot's production does not occur simultaneously with the pot by way of its own entity. If it did, since the basis and that which is based upon it would be co-existent, it would follow that the pot had been produced, for it must exist even as it is approaching production.).L7: [(2) Refuting proof of inherent production].\ ###\ 358.\ That which was previously produced\ Was not old when first produced.\ Also that which afterwards has been\ Constantly produced is not old..(i.e. No real duration or getting old: a product do not last and get old. As it conventionally get old it never stays the same, it continually changes. There is no duration of the same product. Nothing is produced and last. Nothing exist and change.).(-- Even aging is relative, for a product constantly undergoes production.-- Assertion: The pot's production exists, for without it there could be no oldness and so forth, but there is oldness characterized by cessation.-- That is incorrect.-- The previously produced pot was not old when first produced because at that time it was new. A previously produced thing does not grow by way of its own entity. Nor is that old which afterwards has constantly been produced, for also at that time it is new. Since afterward it is newly produced, it will not become old by way of its own entity. Furthermore, by refuting production existent by way of its own entity, oldness existent by way of its own entity is refuted, but mere [conventional] oldness is accepted in our system too.).L6: [e.

The cause and the effect cannot be simultaneous, not sequentially in any order. Production is like an illusion. The product is like an illusion. The three characteristics are like illusions. All part of a conceptual system, an elaborate mental fabrications trying to justify inherent existence, and to control the apparent world.).(-- Since there is no inherent production in any of the three times, production does not truly exist.-- Since cause and effect are not simultaneous, a present thing does not come into existence from its present self. Nor does it come into existence from the future, not from the past. Moreover, since there is no inherent production in any of the three times, one must accept that production is false and like a magician's illusion.Sutra says: "Monks, it is as follows: when the eye is produced, it does not come from anywhere, and when it ceases, it does not go anywhere." Thus if there were inherent production, a thing should come from somewhere when it is produced, like the rising mood, and go somewhere when it ceases, like the setting moon. In that case it would be permanent, but since production and cessation are mere nominal imputations, one must accept that they are like magical illusions.).L5: [2. Summarized meaning: showing the effects of refuting production].\ ###\ 360.\ There is NO COMING of the produced,\ Likewise NO GOING of that which has ceased.\ Since it is thus, why should existence\ Not be like a magician's illusions?.(i.e. The Middle Way about production: Production / origination, duration, and cessation are like illusions. They are empty of inherent existence because dependently arisen. But that doesn't mean that they are completely non-existent. They are not existent, not non-existent, not both, not neither. They are dependent on the mind, but not from the mind only. They are like illusions but not total illusions.).(-- Since things do not come from anywhere when they are produced nor go anywhere when they cease, why should external and internal existence not be like a magician's illusions? When dependent arising is seen as it is, it is like a created illusion and not like a barren woman's child.At this point Candrakirti's commentary says that if mere production is negated, it is the kind of object of comprehension that a barren woman's child is and thus a denial of dependent arising. Inability to assert production in one's own system and placing hope in a system which claims production neither exists [nor does not exist] destroys the Madhyamika view. Since adherence to such an interpretation creates causes for bad rebirths, it should be discarded like a gob of spittle!-- Production is not truly existent, but, neither absolutely non existent.

It follows that it is not, for impermanence and the pot are inherently different. Alternatively, if they are inherently not different, the four, i.e. the three characteristics and that which they characterize, do not clearly have the entity of existing as functional things. It follows that the characteristics are not characteristics because of being one with that which they characterize, and that which they characterize is not what is characterized because of being one with the characteristics.

A produced thing is an origination; a produced non-thing is a cessation. A cause that is a thing is a cause that still exist (simultaneity) at the moment of origination or cessation. A cause that is a non-thing is a cause that do not exist anymore (separateness) at the moment of origination or cessation. So cause and effect (simultaneous or in sequence) cannot explain origination, nor cessation, and thus neither duration.).(-- Assertion: Production and so forth exist inherently because the agent of production exists inherently.-- Answer:-- The sprout, as an already existing functional thing, is not produced again while the seed as a functional thing exist, because a sprout is not produced unless the seed undergoes change. Also a sprout that has already been produced cannot be produced again. (simultaneity of cause and effect in the case of origination)-- The sprout as a functional thing is not produced from a non-functional seed, because a non-functional thing does not have the ability to produce an effect. (cause and effect being separate in the case of origination)-- Furthermore a non-functional effect is not produced from a non-functional cause: a burnt seed does not produce a burnt sprout. (cause and effect being separate in the case of cessation)-- A non-functional effect is not produced from a functional cause since the fallacies already explained apply.

The relationship between cause and effect and the function of production are then examined to establish their lack of inherent existence.-- Moreover, should one consider that production and disintegration pertain to that which has the nature of a functional thing or a non-functional thing? Both are inappropriate.-- Something already produced does not again become a thing being produced, since it is senseless for it to be produced again. (simultaneity of cause and effect in the case of origination)-- A non-functional thing is not produced again as a thing, otherwise it follows that even a barren woman's child could be born. Thus there is no inherent production of either functional or non-functional things.

That which is in the process of production is being produced.-- Answer: It follows that a sprout in the process of production is not being produced by way of its own entity, because that which is in the process of production must be posited as half produced and half unproduced. The produced part belongs to what has already been produced and the unproduced part to what is unproduced. There is nothing in the process of production with parts other than these existent by way of its own entity.

To demonstrate that this too is not produced in and of itself, that which is in the process of being produced is next investigated. Is it identifiable as half produced or half unproduced? Does it already have an identity or not? Is it findable as something between the past and the present? Can one find anything, when an attempt is made in this way to identify the process of production and that which is being produced?-- Assertion: There is a difference between that which is in the process of being produced and the unproduced. That which is in the process of production is said to be associated with the activity of production, whereas the unproduced is not necessarily associated with the activity of production.-- Answer: Since a thing in the process of being produced is associated with the activity of production, you assert that even though it has not completed that activity, it is other than unproduced and future. Yet in that case, since a thing in the process of being produced is other than something produced, you are saying that the unproduced is being produced.) .L7: [(3) Necessity of accepting that the unproduced is being produced, if that which is in the process of being produced is producedby way of its own entity].\ ###\ 373.\ That which is presently being produced,\ Though not yet existent, is later said to exist.\ The unproduced is thus being produced --\ But the non-existent does not arise..(i.e. Until a product is totally produce it is as good as non-existent, but it is certainly not half-produced.).(-- Since that which is presently being produced is other than something produced, you must accept that it is unproduced.

Concluding summary of the refutations of inherent existence [of production / origination, duration, cessation] ].\ ###\ 375.\ Since without a cause\ There is no effect,\ BOTH STARTING AND STOPPING\ ARE NOT FEASIBLE..(i.e. The Middle Way about production / dependent origination: there is no inherent production, no inherent origination, duration and cessation, because they are all dependent on other causes and conditions. Everything is empty of inherent existence because everything is dependently arisen - even production / dependent origination. Causes and effects cannot exist independently of each other. They are interdependent. They are co-dependently arisen concepts. There is no absolute (inherently existing) cause, effect, causality, production, origination, duration, cessation. But that doesn't mean that they are totally non-existent - or that we should drop right now the teaching of dependent origination completely. They exist as mere conventions, they are useful, they could be used as adapted skillful means. There is no absolute causality, but nothing is without a cause, and no cause is without an effect. They are dependent on the mind, but not totally from the mind. They are like illusions, but not totally illusions. They are like the figures seen on the clouds, or the swirls seen at the surface of the ocean. Everything is: not existent, not non-existent, not both, not neither. Cause and effect, like the two poles of any duality, are not different or separate, not the same; not simultaneous, not sequential.).(-- Through this investigation it becomes clear that causes and effects are interdependent, and that neither the arising of an effect nor the cessation of a cause occurs in and of itself.-- Investigation by reasoning shows that there is no effect without a cause. Since cause and effect, then, do not truly exist and since the bases therefore do not truly exist, the sprout's starting to be produced and the seed's stopping to exist are not feasible by way of their own entity. Sutra says:~ "Sentient beings, humans, those born from power whoever they may be.~ None that were born and died here were born [inherently].~ The nature of all things is empty like magician's illusions,~ But the Forders are unable to recognize it."For instance, the men and women conjured by an illusionist cause the spectators of the magic, who think of them as men and women, to feel attraction and aversion. Though they also appear to the magician, he does not think of them in this way. They do not even appear to those who are unaffected by the spell. You must understand that these analogies apply respectively to the perception of common beings who have not understood dependent arising's emptiness of inherent existence, to the wisdom of subsequent attainment of the Exalted, and to the mediative equipoise of the Exalted. You should learn how conventional phenomena are established by conventional valid cognition and ultimate truth by conceptual and non-conceptual reasoning consciousness from the presentation in [Gateway for Conqueror Children], Explanation of [Shantideva's] "Engaging in the Bodhisattva Deeds" and so forth.)L3: [The summarizing stanza:]\ PRODUCTION AND DISINTEGRATION OF COMPOSITE THINGS.\ ###91 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]\ ARE LIKE DREAMS AND LIKE ILLUSION.\ When they are mere terms and mere imputation,\ How could non-products be truly existent?.(i.e. There is no possible direct perception of origination, duration and cessation as taught in the Abhidharma; this cannot be used to prove the inherent existence of functional things, or the non-existence of others.

They exist in dependence.-- No thesis could be proven. All theses are flawed. -- Holding a thesis is believing something is absolutely right, absolutely truly existent, that in a polarity there is a right side and a wrong side. All thesis are based on inherent existence, polarity, one of the four lemmas.-- You can show the absurdity of a thesis, but never prove a thesis. -- Emptiness is a negation (of inherent existence) without affirming anything (emptiness of emptiness).-- No reasoning, or analogies, can prove a thesis. -- Like, the reasons are to the thesis, what the parts are to the whole, what origination duration and cessation are to the impermanent things. They are not one, they are not separate.-- The four positions are flawed. the Tetralemma: Although things are empty, they are non absolutely non-existent either. Things do not exist and then are empty. Things exist in dependence. ---- This is not a thesis: Madhyamika do not advances a thesis of their own; they do not hold thesis that things exist, do not, or do and do not exit ... And because of that, no counter-arguments can be found.-- Emptiness of emptiness: Even emptiness is empty of true existence, because its objects are not truly existent.-- Emptiness of Dependent Origination: There is a flow but no chunks in it; no real cause, effect, causality. These are all concepts dependent on each others.-- Beyond dualities: It is not about choosing the right side in a polarity. Both sides are dependent on each other; there is no right or wrong side. Taking side is choosing a thesis. All theses are flawed.-- Beyond the Tetralemma: Since all four theses are seen to be flawed, one should not accept any thesis of true existence. Refuting those four positions is the position of the Madhyamikas. And because of that they cannot be refuted themselves.-- Two skilful means / antidotes: Like: you can use "emptiness" to show the absurdity any theory based on the reality of something; and you can use "Dependent Origination" to disprove the theory that everything is non-existent at all. But none of them is by itself a final absolute theory. -- Seems like the idea is to use those tools (Emptiness and Dependent Origination) to destroy any positions based on the four possible theories (things exist, do not exist, exist then do not exist, something else).-- The Union of both: Ultimately one realize directly that things are empty because the dependently originate, and vice versa.-- No dualities, no differentiation, everything should be seen as pure: Since the polarity between existent and non- existent is flawed, in emptiness everything is equal, identical; there is no objective discrimination possible. There is no absolute right in opposition to an absolute wrong. Everything is relative, dependent. Everything could be used for the path. Obsession with right and wrong is the problem. But don't tell this to an unprepared mind.-- Seeing the emptiness of one thing is seeing the emptiness of all things -- they are all equal, everything has the same ultimate nature, no absolute discrimination.-- What good is it to perceive emptiness? : Thinking of things as truly existent causes one to accumulate actions and thereby wander in cyclic existence, but through fully understanding that all phenomena lack inherent existence, one gains release from worldly existence.-- Only through a very gradual adapted path can one be lead to the realization of the true nature of the three: subject, object, action. It is not like acquiring ordinary knowledge, or building something through a precise absolute method.

Without ascertaining the meaning of emptiness as it actually is, one cannot develop enthusiasm for omniscience or even for liberation through the giving up of attachment to cyclic existence. The emptiness of inherent existence of all phenomena frightens those who have not heard sufficient teaching and are bound by the noose of clinging to a self. As already described, the path leading to freedom from worldly existence should therefore only be explained after first making the mind ready, in the way that the death of a king's beloved queen was conveyed to him. -- Even though things are empty of inherent existence, they appear not to be empty and are thought of in this way for various reasons, such as considering them truly existent. All of the preceding fifteen chapters refute these reasons individually.).L3: [II. Eliminating remaining counter-arguments raised by misguided opponents] L4: [A.

There is no exception at all. Even the three gems are empty of inherent existence, even the body speech and mind of a Buddha is empty of inherent existence.

They exist conventionally, as adapted skillful means.).(-- Opponents support the contention of true existence by pointing out that both the author, his subject-matter and the words he uses exist. Of course they exist, but not inherently as is claimed, because they depend upon one another.-- Assertion: ab. If the chapters were written for these purposes, things are established as not being empty, since the author and the subject matter explained by the fifteen chapters exist. "Also" indicates the words that express the meaning of emptiness. Therefore it is incorrect to speak of the emptiness of inherent existence of things.-- Answer: cd According to us, the words, subject matter and author are imputations dependent on one another and do not exist independently. Whatever arises in dependence does not exist inherently. Since the author, subject matter and words are all dependently imputed, these three also do not have inherent existence. Thus emptiness is well established.) .L6: [b.

You, however, are simply engaged in dismissing the proponents of emptiness. If on the one hand you like disproving the thesis of others, why do you not like proving your own? You should! To proponents of emptiness whatever proofs you adduce to validate your own thesis remain as unestablished as that which is to be proved. You should therefore give up adherence to the thesis that things are inherently existent.).L6: [b.

None of those four philosophical position can be proven; none is the absolute truth. In other words: Emptiness is not it. Dependent origination is not it. Both together is not it. And it is not something else either. The real nature of everything is beyond any of those views, system, concepts, antidotes. To affirm an absolute truth is necessarily wrong; any system presenting itself as having the absolute truth is necessarily wrong, and can be disproved.).(All theses are flawed, the Tetralemma:-- Assertion ab: The thesis put forward by proponents of emptiness is not feasible since when thoroughly investigated, it is illogical. Something which does not exist as a knowable object is not an assertable thesis. Therefore the thesis put forward by proponents of true existence is established.-- Answer: No thesis is feasible when investigated by the reasoning that analyzes the ultimate.95 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]-- cd: Since negated by this reasoning, truly existent oneness, otherness and ineffability asserted by any opponent are also not theses.

So the teachings on this subject in the Abhidharma should not be taken as absolute, but merely as adapted skillful means for those not ready for the subtle emptiness, as provisional truths requiring further interpretation. They are not definitive truths like taught in the Heart of Wisdom Sutras, or in the teachings of Nagarjuna and his disciples.).(-- Assertion ab: The reason proving the pot empty of true existence is meaningless and ineffectual, for wherever there is a directly perceptible pot, that truly existent pot is, according to us, established by direct perception.-- Answer cd: In relation to the thesis of proponents establishing emptiness of true existence through reasoning, reasons appearing in their opponents' textual systems are unacceptable, because they are engaged in rejecting them.-- Question: Then are reasons from these textual systems inappropriate in all cases?-- Answer: Elsewhere there is no incompatibility, since they pertain where both protagonists' tenets are similar.).L6: [b. Since emptiness exists, its opposite, true existence, is not feasible].\ ###\ 382.\ When there is nothing that is not empty,\ How can emptiness be so?\ When the one does not exist,\ Why should the antidote exist?.(i.e. Even emptiness is a mere temporary adapted skillful means: Emptiness is the antidote to inherent existence (realism), like Dependent Origination is the antidote to complete non-existence (nihilism). But none of them is the final absolute truth. Once one has completely eradicated the belief in inherent existence, there is no more need for its antidote. The same for dependent origination.).(Emptiness is not a characteristic of something really existing:-- As part of a final refutation of extreme views, the fact that even emptiness lacks true existence is emphasized. If Madhyamika asserted that emptiness were truly existent, the phenomena which act as its basis would necessarily also be truly existent. However since no such assertion is made, how can these phenomena have true existence?-- Assertion: You proponents of emptiness accept the entity of emptiness, and since emptiness is not feasible unless it relies on non-emptiness, things are truly existent.-- Answer: It follows that the existence of emptiness does not establish its opposite, that there is true existence.-- If emptiness were truly existent, truly existent things as its basis would be feasible, but as there is nothing that is not empty of true existence, how can emptiness be truly existent? Its basis cannot possibly be truly existent. Why, when the basis does not have true existence, would the antidote negating it be truly existent? For emptiness to be truly existent, its basis would have to have a truly existent nature. Fundamental Wisdom says:~ If the slightest thing were not empty~ Emptiness would have some existence and so forth. The Two Truths says:~ Since the object of negation is non-existent,~ The negation clearly does not exist as [its own] reality.) .L4: [B.

Refuting that the non-thesis is a thesis].\ ###\ 383.\ If there were a thesis, absence of the thesis\ Would in entity be a thesis,\ But where there is no thesis\ What can be the counter-thesis?.(i.e. Transcending all dualities: Let's consider the duality Dependent Origination (based on inherently existing causes, effects, causality, particles, space, time, ...) and Emptiness (the negation of their inherent existence). Facing such duality (thesis and counter-thesis) some say that necessarily one is true and the other false, others might say that both are true, or that none of them is true, that it is something else that would include the opposites, a big One. Those are the four usual positions in relation to the polarity in any duality. These four positions corresponds to the usual Tetralemma. The solution presented here points toward the transcendence of the duality: not taking one side as true and rejecting the other, not taking both sides together, not rejecting both sides. And this is done by realizing the real nature of the duality, that there is no real opposition, that it is just an illusion. For example, between existence and non- existence, the solution is : not existence, not non-existence, not both, not neither. That is staying away from the four usual extremes; that is the Middle Way. As for this real nature of the duality of existence and non-existence, it has to be directly seen beyond all conceptualization. - In the case of thesis (emptiness) and counter-thesis (inherent existence or Dependent Origination as taught in the Abhidharma), one has to realize that both poles are empty of inherent existence because co-dependently arisen concepts. This permits to transcend the duality. This could be applied to any dualities, to any dharma in the three realms.).(About the thesis polarity: The opponent say that thesis are in polarity, if one is proven false, then the other must be true. But, both side, and the polarity itself, are illusions. If one side could be proven as truly existent, then the other one would be proven as existent, but none can be proven as truly existent. Each side cannot exist on its own, independent of the other side. In dualities, it is never one, nor the another, nor both, nor neither. -- So, even if emptiness is not an absolutely true absolute thesis, having its own absurdity, it does not prove that "existence" is a valid thesis. Both are dependent.-- This is followed by a summary of various refutations of true existence introduced in previous chapters.-- Assertion: Since there is not even the slightest emptiness, it cannot constitute one's thesis. Nevertheless by accepting the absence of a system of one's own as one's system, one is asserting a thesis. Since there is no thesis which does not depend on a counter-thesis, truly existent things--the counter-thesis--exist.-- Answer: If we had any thesis of existence by way of a thing's own entity, the absence of a thesis would in entity be a thesis existent by way of its own entity. However since we do not have any thesis of existence byway of a thing's own entity, a counter-thesis dependent upon that is also impossible. Moreover all theses concerning truly existent things have already been refuted above. Thus if the absence of a thesis does not exist by way of its own entity, what truly existent thing could constitute the counter-thesis? Neither thesis nor counter-thesis have even an atom of true existence. By this we refute truly existent emptiness as our system, which should not, however, be interpreted as showing that we have no system.).L6: [b.

It cannot, for there are no truly existent things. Above it was said that even hot fire does not exist inherently.[Stanza 341] says:~ That which is hot is fire but how~ Can that burn which is not hot?~ Thus so-called fuel does not exist,~ And without it fire too does not.~ This point has already been refuted.) .L7: [(2) Refuting the four extremes by reasoning].\ ###\ 385.\ If through seeing things one could refute\ The statement that things do not exist,\ Who then sees the elimination\ Of fallacies regarding ALL FOUR THESES..(i.e. The Middle Way about the Tetralemma: Tetralemma: There are four usual positions regarding existence: existence, non-existence, both, neither. There is no other possibility. None is the final view, the absolute truth. But they are antidotes to each other. Existence (or Dependent Origination) is the antidote to non-existence (nihilism or too much Emptiness). Emptiness is the antidote to existence (realism or too much Dependent Origination). Dualism and Oneness are antidotes to each other. The Middle Way consists of not accepting any of those four extremes as an absolute, an not rejecting them as if completely useless, meaningless - they could be used as adapted skillful means depending on the immediate problem. We have no choice, we cannot use the real absolute truth right now because it is beyond conceptualization, and we have not directly realized it yet. But when this will be done we would have transcended all of those dualities, all views and will need no more antidotes. Until then we need to use both method and wisdom together without falling into either of them. This could be applied to any dualities, to any dharma in the three realms.).(-- Moreover, even if, one seeing the thing which is fire, it were appropriate to refute the statement that fire does not exist truly, who sees the elimination of fallacies associated with the true existence of oneness and difference and of all four theses such as existence and non-existence and so forth exposed by the reasoning of dependent arising? Since all four theses are seen to be flawed, one should not accept any thesis of true existence. - see verse 346).L7: [(3) Not even the smallest particle of true existence can be observed].\ ###\ 386.\ When there is nowhere, even in particles,\ A truly existent entity, how can it occur?\ Even for Buddhas, it does not exist.\ Thus it is irrelevant..(i.e. Emptiness of everything means no inherent production: Using the methods described above we come to the conclusion that everything is empty of inherent existence. How can there be inherently production of anything then, as described in the teaching of Dependent Origination in the Abhidharma. There is conventional dependent origination, but there is no inherent cause, effect, causality, particles, space, time, etc. There is conventional production, but no inherent production. All productions are like illusions. - When Dependent Origination and Emptiness are correctly understood, there is no more opposition between the two as perceived by the opponents here. In fact, one implies the other. They are interdependent, and both empty of inherent existence. That is how this duality is transcended. When perfectly understood by a single mind it is called the Perfect Union of The Two truths. Then one is a Buddha.).(-- When one examines how fire exists, whether a thing and its parts are inherently one or different or how particles exist, one finds that nothing is truly existent but that everything depends on other factors.-- For the following reason, too, it is incorrect to assert true existence:-- As explained in the context of [stanza 305],~ This also applies when one examines98 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]~ Whether particles have parts.If there were a truly existent entity, it should be observable even in extremely small things such as particles, but it is not observable. How can truly existent production occur for that which does not exist anywhere? It is totally incorrect to accept as existent that which is non-existent to the perception of Buddhas, the sun-like radiance of whose consummate understanding of the suchness of things dispels all darkness of ignorance. Asserting true existence is thus unrelated to any feasible thesis.).L6: [c.

We could apply the treatment described above (V.383) to solve the opposition in the duality of existence and non-existence itself. We then find that existence and non-existence cannot exist one without the other, and they cannot exist together as two separate entities. They are interdependent, two co-dependently arisen concepts. Meaning that everything is: not existent, not non-existent, not both, not neither. The real nature of everything is beyond this duality, beyond all conceptualization. - But realizing the real nature of this duality it is easy to generalize the emptiness of inherent existence to everything that is thought to be inherently existent, or inherently non-existent, ...).(Since the duality [existent, non existent] is flawed:-- If there is no twofold division into truly existent and not truly existent, what, such as particles and so forth, could have a truly existent entity, since all forms of true existence have been precludes?

All criteria of differentiation are relative to an infinity of causes and conditions, among which is the very mind making the choices, and its accumulated karma. There is no impartial direct perception of any absolute characteristics or objects. All dualities like pure-impure, good-bad, desirable-not-desirable, stillness-occurrence, are illusions that need to be transcended. So, in that sense, everything is already pure. There is nothing to do or not do, nothing to get or drop, nothing to directly see or not see. Nirvana is not caused or produced through our own effort, or not. We already have the Buddha-nature.?-- No absolute basis for non-discrimination - everything exist conventionally: On the other hand, because those are not completely non-existent either (there is no real non-existence in the duality existence vs non-existence), we should think everything is the same, not drop all discrimination, do nothing, drop all paths. That would be like killing ourselves; we cannot escape samsara like that. They do exist conventionally, and are still dependently arisen and functional. There is still Dependent Origination, the Wheel of Life, karma formation and its consequences; they are just not inherently existent or absolute.?-- The Middle Way in discrimination: Everything is not different, not the same; non-dual: not two, not one.).(-- From the point of view of their fundamental nature, there are no distinctions among phenomena, for everything is99 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]equally empty of true existence.-- If any reasoning could disprove the thesis concerning emptiness of true existence, we would be convinced, but since things cannot be proved truly existent, you should accept only our thesis.-- If the nature of internal and external things were truly existent, they would not depend on causes and conditions. Also differentiations of truly existent and not truly existent are inappropriate with regard to the absence of truly existent things. There are no differences in the entity of space, because it is a mere absence of obstructing form. Similarly regarding emptiness of true existence, the nature seen in all substantial entities, [stanza 191] says:~ Whoever sees one thing,~ Is said to see all.~ That which is the emptiness of one~ Is the emptiness of all.-- Sutra says, "Whoever has come to know the non-functional with regard to functional things has no attachment to functional things." There are no distinctions of truly existent and not truly existent with regard to any phenomenon whatsoever.).L5: [2. Refuting the justification]L6: [a. Appropriateness of accepting the thesis of emptiness of true existence].\ ###\ 389.\ If owing to non-existence you claim\ No reply is made to the other's thesis,\ Why would you not also prove\ Your own thesis which is refuted by reasons?.(i.e. Failure to prove any side of a duality: If you still think dualities are real and that one of the two opposite thesis must be right and the other false, then how come you cannot prove your thesis ? Your failure only proves that taking side in any duality is never wise; we need to transcend all dualities, because all views are flawed (never absolute), because everything is empty of inherent existence because dependently arisen.).(-- If opponents of the Middle Way nevertheless choose to dispute this thesis, they must convincingly establish their own position, yet they repeatedly fail to do so.-- Challenge: After first analyzing, you should either accept emptiness or make a reply.-- Objection: It would be appropriate to make a reply if the slightest thing were accepted as truly existent, but since according to you everything is non-existent, how can any reply be made?-- Answer: If you claim that no reply is made to the Madhyamika thesis because everything is non-existent, why should it not also be proper to prove your own thesis which is refuted by the reasons that prove emptiness? Since one cannot refute another's thesis without proving one's own, yours has become non-existent.).L6: [b.

It is a negation without affirming anything. It is like space, like true cessation. It depends on nothing. It is not produced.).(-- Thus finding cogent arguments that invalidate the Madhyamika position is obviously not as simple as they claim.-- Assertion: Even if one is unable to prove one's thesis, it is said and well known in the world that reasons which refute others' theses are easy to find.100 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]-- Answer:-- Since in that case you too must be in possession of those easily found reasons with which to refute, why are even you unable to fault the others' thesis, that of the Madhyamikas? Thus as you are unable to fault the others' thesis, reasons refuting emptiness are not easy to find.).L4: [C. Showing parity of reasoning with regard to true existence or lack of true existence] L5: [1.

So the teachings on this subject in the Abhidharma should not be taken as absolute, but merely as adapted skillful means for those not ready for the subtle emptiness, as provisional truths requiring further interpretation. They are not definitive truths like taught in the Heart of Wisdom Sutras, or in the teachings of Nagarjuna and his disciples.).(-- If things were truly existent merely because one says they are, they would, by the same argument, be empty of true existence merely by saying they are; words alone do not affect reality.-- If even without reasoning, but merely by saying the words "They exist," things existed as their own suchness, why should their emptiness of true existence not also be established merely by our saying the words "They do not exist truly"? The reasoning is the same in all respects. Therefore, rejecting assertions regarding the two extremes, we both should firmly establish the textual system free from all fabrications which asserts non-existence of the two extremes.).L5: [2. Mere designation as truly existent will not make it so].\ ###\ 392.\ If a thing is not non-existent\ Because the term "existent" is ascribed,\ Neither is it existent\ because the term "existent" is applied..(i.e. Otherwise, there are other books that says other things ... And it is not because someone say that this was said by the Buddha that it makes it an absolute truth. It only proves that it was used as another adapted skilful means in a certain occasion by the Buddha. The Buddha said to stay away from all extremes.).(-- Assertion: If things do not exist ultimately, the designation "things exist" is incorrect and as unreasonable as terming a barren woman's child existent.-- Answer: If things do not lack true existence because the designation "they are and exist" is ascribed, neither are they truly existent because the designation "they exist truly" is applied. Calling someone with good eyesight blind or someone with a short life long-lived does not make them so. Besides, if things could be accomplished by words alone, it would be just as reasonable to accept that they lack true existence as to think they are truly existent.).L5: [3.

But obviously this means that they do not exist on their own, inherently; they are mere conventions, like illusion. We do not deny that.).(-- Another's assertion: Words do not reveal an object's entity. If they did, one's mouth would burn when saying "fire" or be full when saying "pot." Therefore we assert that ordinary people all have means of expression and terms for that which is being expressed which do not touch an object's own entity.-- Answer: Supposedly things all exist inherently and as conventions because ordinary people speak of them by means of words which do not touch their entity. But how can anything that exists inherently, existing as its own suchness, be a convention? It could only be ultimately existent.).L4: [D. Refuting non-existence as the thesis]L5: [1. Refuting that negation of truly existent things makes things utterly non-existent].\ ###\ 394.\ If things are non-existent because\ Things all do not exist,\ In that case it is incorrect that all these\ Concern the non-existence of things..(i.e. Emptiness doesn't mean complete non-existence: that would be falling to the other extreme, nihilism. Even if everything is empty of inherent existence, they are still dependently arisen and functional. Everything is dependent on the mind labeling it, but still not from the mind only. Nothing is really existent, non-existent, both, neither. The duality existence vs non-existence has to be transcended by directly seeing the real nature of the duality itself - not taking one side and rejecting the other, nor accepting both, nor rejecting both.).(-- Assertion: Since you deny that things have true existence, things are non-existent.-- Answer: If even the slightest thing is non-existent because things are not truly existent, it is incorrect that all Madhyamika theses concern the non-existence of things through refutation of previously existent truly established things, for there has never been any true existence.).L5: [2. As there are no truly existent things that which is non-functional cannot be truly existent either].\ ###\ 395.\ Since a thing does not exist\ A non-thing cannot exist.\ Without a thing's existence,\ How can a non-thing be established?.(i.e. Another reason - Because something that has never inherently existed cannot be completely non-existent later: If there is no inherent production of anything, if everything is empty of inherent existence, then there could be no inherent cessation or anything. So emptiness could not mean complete-non-existence. - Nirvana is not produced by dropping everything, since nothing was existent in the first place. It is just a matter of directly seeing this, which is like seeing luminous space.).(-- Since truly existent functional things, the object of negation, do not exist, their non-functional negation cannot be truly existent. In the world a completely disintegrated thing is said to be non-functional. In keeping with this, a completely disintegrated pot would not be feasible if the pot had never existed. Thus how could the non-functional be truly existent, when there are no truly existent functional things? The existence of a dependent thing is not feasible without that on which it depends.).L4: [E. Refuting that things are not empty because analogies and reasons to establish emptiness exist]L5: [1. Showing the invalidity in the form of absurd consequences [of asserting that] there is true existence because there are reasons].102 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]\ ###\ 396.\ If things are not empty because\ They are empty by virtue of reasons,\ The thesis would not be distinct from the reasons,\ And thus the reasons would not exist..(i.e. Could emptiness be an effect of a certain type of logic - reasons?: Let's suppose that it is a series of reasons that makes things empty of inherent existence, that they were not like this before the reasoning. This would mean the emptiness depends on those reasons, depends on a certain type of logic. That makes those reasons the "causes" and emptiness the "effect". Again using the method described above we could observe that this production is not inherent because the causes and the effect cannot be different or separate in time, nor the same or simultaneous. In other words there is no absolute causes (reasons) that could produce the effect (emptiness), and no absolute effect. Both are interdependent, co-dependently arisen concepts, empty of inherent existence because dependently arisen. And all this only confirm that everything is already empty even before any reasoning.).(-- It is a mistake to think that things were previously truly existent, but are rendered non-existent through refutation of their true existence. They never existed in this way in the first place.-- Assertion: In order to prove emptiness you must adduce reasons. Thus since the reasons exist, things are not empty, for like the reasons everything else is also truly existent.-- Answer: If things were not empty because emptiness of true existence is established through reasons, and the thesis and reasons were inherently distinct, they would be unrelated. If the thesis were not inherently distinct from the reason but inherently one with it, they would have to be one and therefore what is to be proved could not be understood by depending on the reason. Then it follows that there are no correct reasons, since the fallacy of there being no reasons arises when one asserts truly existent things. Therefore all phenomena are established as lacking inherent existence.).L5: [2. Showing the invalidity in the form of absurd consequences [of asserting that] things are not empty because thereare analogies].\ ###\ 397.\ If things are not empty because\ There are analogies for emptiness,\ Can one say, "Just like the crow,\ So too the self is black"?.(i.e. Could emptiness be an effect of a certain type of logic - analogies?: Same reasoning as the previous verse in the case of "logical analogies", otherwise everything would be possible like the example in this verse.).(About thesis and analogies:-- Neither the existence of reasons nor analogies establishing emptiness can be used to support the thesis that things are truly existent, for the reasons and analogies themselves lack true existence.-- Assertion: Since there are analogies for emptiness of inherent existence, such as the reflection and so forth, everything else, like those analogies, exists and is not empty.-- Answer: Is the analogy related or unrelated to the reason's meaning? The first has already been precluded by the reasoning which refutes truly existent reasons. In the second case, if the meaning is established through an analogy unrelated to the reason, is one able to say, "Just as the crow is black, so too is the self," because they are alike in being functional things? One should be able to do so. Yet an analogy, merely by virtue of its existence, is not suitable as an analogy for true existence.).L4: [F. Explaining the purpose of teaching emptiness].\ ###\ 398.\ If things exist inherently\ What good is it to perceive emptiness?\ Perception by way of conception binds.\ This is refuted here.103 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2].(i.e. The Middle Way about logic: The fact that all logic - reasons, analogies, ... - are empty of inherent existence doesn't mean that it is completely non-existent, useless, meaningless. We still can use illusions to help to go over other illusions - the important is that there is a progression toward reality. Even if emptiness and Dependent Origination are both empty of inherent existence, they are still dependently arisen and functional. They are efficient antidotes in their proper situation. - We have no choice, we cannot jump from here to Nirvana without a virtuous path, without a gradual deconditioning. A gradual path composed of more and more subtle methods and wisdom, of adapted skillful means, can help in gradually seeing through our conditioning / karma, and ultimately attain total Liberation. Using logic showing the absurdity of the illusions, of our conditioning, is part of this. -- It is not because everything is empty of inherent existence that everything is completely non-existent, useless, meaningless, or that we should drop everything, drop all paths, or kill ourselves. That would be jumping to the other extreme, and certainly not escaping samsara.).(-- Question: If analogies, reasons and all things do not exist, what is the purpose of writing all the chapters of your treatise?-- Answer: It is for the attainment of liberation and omniscience through understanding the meaning of suchness.-- If things existed inherently, what good would there be in perceiving / emptiness, since it would be erroneous? Thinking of things as truly existent causes one to accumulate actions and thereby wander in cyclic existence, but through fully understanding that all phenomena lack inherent existence, one gains release from worldly existence Thus as long as one sees things as truly existent, because of conceptions which cling to their true existence, one is bound to cyclic existence. In this treatise, therefore, the truly existent person and aggregates, which are the referent objects of conceptions of true existence are refuted by an extensive collection of reasoning. Sutra says, "All phenomena are empty in that they do not exist inherently" and so forth. Accordingly, this was written to teach lack of inherent existence, which does not contradict the acceptance in our system of al dependently arising phenomena.).L4: [G. Showing that conceptions of extremes of existence are erroneous].\ ###\ 399.\ To say one exists and the other does not\ Is neither reality nor the conventional.\ Therefore it cannot be said\ That this exists but that does not..(i.e. About the Mind Only School - the duality world-mind: One of the extremes, or skillful means, consist of thinking that only the mind inherently exist, and that everything else are completely non-existent, total fabrications of the mind. But this theory doesn't make sense nor from an absolute point of view, neither from a conventional point of view. We have already shown that everything is empty of inherent existence because everything is dependently arisen, and that there is no exception at all, not even for the three gems, dependent origination or emptiness, causality space or time, parts or characteristics, ... A consciousness cannot exist without being conscious of something; these are co-dependent. - This is about the duality world-mind. Taking one side as absolute and the other not is not transcending the problem; it is falling into one extreme. The solution is to see their interdependence, their emptiness of inherent existence. Staying away from the four extremes: taking one side and rejecting the other, taking both sides, rejecting both sides. This applies to all dualities.).(-- Among our own sectarians, Vijnaptivadins and all those who have not understood the actual meaning of the scriptures assert that consciousness is truly existent, and that external objects do not even exist conventionally. This is therefore shown to be wrong, for both are alike in existing conventionally but not ultimately.-- To say that one exists and the other does not is not a presentation of reality, since both do not exist ultimately and are not ultimate truths. Nor is it a presentation of the conventional, since both exist conventionally and are conventional truths. Therefore all five aggregates exist conventionally but not ultimately, and so it cannot be said that mind and mental factors exist truly while external objects do not even exist conventionally. Thus Madhyamikas, too, accept both external objects and consciousness as they are known in the world.).L4: [H.

This perfection consist of staying away from all four extreme (Tetralemma)s: existence, non-existence, both, neither. It consist of staying away from all four positions concerning any duality. It is the Middle Way: not accepting any view, not rejecting any view. And since there is no other conceptual possibility, it is a negation without affirming anything. It is like space, like true cessation. It depends on nothing. It is not produced. It is indestructible, and has incommensurable powers. Why? Because it is almost perfectly in accord with the real non-dual nature of everything which is beyond any conceptualization and seen only by a Buddha.).(-- Though things do not exist in and of themselves, they nevertheless exist. Through understanding their true mode of existence, we can gain freedom.-- When assertions regarding true existence of things and so forth have been thoroughly refuted in this way, it is impossible to state any refutation of the assertions regarding emptiness.-- Assertion: Even though we are unable to answer you at present, you will receive an answer--there will be those who make great effort on behalf of the Tathagata's teaching.-- Answer: That is a futile hope! If we held a faulty thesis, it could be refuted by proving its converse.-- No Madhyamikas hold the erroneous theses that things are inherently existent, that even the slightest thing is non- existent, that non-things are inherently both existent and non-existent, or neither. No matter how long one tries, no counter-arguments can be raised. You should understand that refuting skilled proponents of emptiness is as impossible as drawing pictures in space or causing space pain by beating it with an iron bar.-- The Master Dharmadasa gave one analogy for each stanza of the first eight chapters.

I have also tried to make it evident that the discussion is about showing that dependent origination, and the virtuous methods based on it, are still valid if properly understood as including no inherently existing elements (cause, effect, particles, space, time, causality, production) whatsoever. I have also stressed non-duality as not two, not one; as the inseparability of opposites, as co- dependent concepts..So, contrary to the usual western misunderstanding of the relation between dependent origination and emptiness, THEY ARE NOT ONE, THEY ARE NOT THE SAME. Non-duality means: not two, not one; or not different, but still not the same. Transcending a duality doesn't mean to reject completely the difference between the two poles, to reject the duality. The two poles are interdependent, inseparable, not different but still not the same; not two, not one. The Middle Way consist of not accepting anything as absolute, not rejecting everything as completely non-existent, useless, meaningless. TO THINK THAT DEPENDENT ORIGINATION AND EMPTINESS ARE THE SAME IS TO FALL INTO ONE OF THE FOUR EXTREMES. It is a grave mistake that inhibits one from pursuing their real nature and progressing in more subtle wisdom; it is an easy trap for intellectual fools seeking absolute certainties. Their non- duality is more subtle than this; it is beyond all conceptualization. I hope my comments will help in realizing this..Other complementary re?sume? presentations taken from the book are available in the Introduction, Preface and in each chapters..109 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]L2: [Re?sume? of all chapters together].On the path, we need both virtuous methods (based on dependent origination) and wisdom (based on emptiness) together, the two accumulations, corresponding to the Two Inseparable Truths.

ACCUMULATING MERIT USING CONVENTIONAL TRUTHS BASED ON THE HINAYANA POINT OF VIEW : the law of karma, dependent origination as presented in the Abhidharma, the three marks (impermanence, unsatisfactoriness, no-self), the Four Noble Truths..-- 1) Meditation on death and impermanence.-- 2) Meditation on unsatisfactoriness.-- 3) Meditation on the foulness of the body.-- 4) Meditation on no-self..PART I. B. ACCUMULATING MERIT USING SKILLFUL MEANS BASED THE MAHAYANA POINT OF VIEW: THE MIDDLE WAY.-- 5) THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT MORALITY: acting using more wisdom than following strict rules: the importance of the Bodhicitta motivation, relativity, interdependence, love, compassion, cooperation, exchanging self with others.-- 6) THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH DISTURBING EMOTIONS: using temporary antidotes, and wisdom in order to transcend them definitively, to transmute them into the five wisdoms.-- 7) THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT HOW TO DEAL WITH VIRTUES AND METHODS: perfecting them by combining their practice with the wisdom realizing the emptiness of the three: subject, object, action.-- 8) THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT THE PATH: using a gradual path composed of both method and wisdom together all the time until we can directly realize the real non-dual nature of the source of all disturbing emotions and thus transcend all karma..PART II. ACCUMULATING WISDOM BY GRADUALLY REALIZING THE ULTIMATE TRUTH.-- 9) NO ABSOLUTE DEPENDENT ORIGINATION, CAUSALITY, DETERMINISM, PATH (all causes, effects are empty of inherent existence because dependent on other causes and conditions, and interdependent). But there is conventional causality, causes and effect. Liberation is not a functional thing, not caused by an absolute path.-- 10) THERE IS NO SELF AS A PRIMARY CAUSE (free will), nothing permanent that is having rebirths, or that is being Liberated. But there is still continuity in samsara, and possible Liberation.-- 11) THERE IS NO ABSOLUTE TIME AS A PRIMARY CAUSE. Time, duration, impermanence, are relative to the existence of empty things.-- 12) THERE IS NO FINAL ABSOLUTE VIEW, OR SYSTEM. All views are flawed. But this has to be realized through a gradual path combining more and more subtle virtuous methods and wisdom - emptiness-- 13) THERE IS NO DIRECT PERCEPTION OF AN EXTERNAL INDEPENDENT REALITY BY OBJECTIVE SENSES AND INHERENT CONSCIOUSNESS. All perceptions are conditioned by accumulated karma. The world and the mind are both empty because interdependent, inseparable, non-dual.-- 14) THE PERFECTION OF WISDOM: All objects of the three realms (body, speech & mind) are: not inherently existent, not completely non-existent, not both, not neither. All dualities can be transcended by examining the interdependence of the two poles, their inseparability. Everything is non-dual: not two, not one; even the dualities like whole & parts / characteristics, cause & effect, existence & non-existence, dependent origination & emptiness, the Two Truths, impure & pure, samsara & Nirvana. Everything is already pure in emptiness. There is no absolute basis for discrimination or non-discrimination.-- 15) THE PERFECTION OF DEPENDENT ORIGINATION consists of uniting it with emptiness, transcending the duality.-- 16) THE PERFECTION OF EMPTINESS consists of uniting it with dependent origination, transcending the duality. That is the realization of THE UNION OF THE TWO TRUTHS, realizing their inseparability, their non-duality. Those expressions point toward a realization which is beyond all conceptualization..110 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]L2: [Re?sume? of each chapter]L3: [PART I - Explaining the Stages of the Paths dependent on CONVENTIONAL TRUTHS (accumulation of merit)] L4: [SECTION I - A : Showing how the aspiring altruistic intention is generated after training in the attitudes of a person of intermediate capacity by explaining elimination of the four errors.].CHAPTER 1 - ABANDONING BELIEF IN PERMANENCE (death & permanent) - THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT DEATH: Remembering death in order to abandon obsessions to worldly concerns, attachments, fears, and to have a strong motivation to practice the dharma. But not being obsessed by death either. On a more subtle level: everything is continually changing, impermanent..CHAPTER 2 - ABANDONING BELIEF IN PLEASURE (pleasurable) - THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT OUR BODY: not being slave to our insatiable body, not rejecting it completely as being useless; this precious human life is necessary to gain Enlightenment. Seeing the nature and relativity of pleasures. The three kinds of suffering: physical, mental, all- pervasive: everything that is impermanent is unsatisfactory. The five aggregates themselves are suffering if we cling to them. Developing compassion knowing everybody is in the same situation..CHAPTER 3 - ABANDONING BELIEF IN CLEANNESS (attractive) - THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT OTHERS. Not being slave to our insatiable sensual desires. Using the temporary antidote to sensual desire: foulness of the body. Seeing the relative or conventional nature of what we find attractive or not. On the other hand, not rejecting others completely; the reality is that we are interdependent. So we need to develop love, compassion, cooperation..CHAPTER 4 - ABANDONING PRIDE (self) - THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT OUR INDIVIDUALITY. There is no absolute basis for the "I" and "mine", or any status, or pride. Nothing that is impermanent, unsatisfactory and unclean can be the "self". But that doesn't means that the self is completely non-existent, or that we should reject self- confidence completely. We need to see the relativity of status, our interdependence and feel compassion for others..L4: [SECTION I - B : Explaining how to train in the deeds, having generated the practical altruistic intention.].CHAPTER 5 - BODHISATTVA DEEDS - THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT MORAL LAWS, THE BEST EFFICIENT WAY TO ACT AND GAIN POWER - THE WAY TO ACT LIKE A BUDDHA: Not accepting absolute moral laws, not rejecting morality completely. Going beyond simple morality based on absolute right and wrong, strict rules as taught in the Hinayana, and the belief in individual liberation. What counts is a more realistic motivation in all actions, Bodhicitta, and using gradual adapted skilful means (relativity) and wisdom (seeing the emptiness of all elements). This brings incommensurable efficiency and power, because it is more in accord with the real nature of everything: relativity, interdependence, the need for cooperation, emptiness, non-duality). What counts is not to follow absolute rules, but to find the best way to get out of samsara definitively; and the ego is one of the biggest obstacles..CHAPTER 6 - ABANDONING DISTURBING EMOTIONS - THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT CONTROLLING DISTURBING EMOTIONS: Not letting them go wild; but being able to recognize them and to use their specific temporary antidotes (based on the law of dependent origination) in order to diminish their negative consequences, otherwise we might get overwhelmed by negative karma. On the other hand, not getting obsessed by trying to control them all the time, because those antidotes are mere temporary solutions. The only final solution is to see their real nature (their dependence and emptiness of inherent existence) and to transmute them into the five wisdoms. So, in dealing with disturbing emotions, we need both methods (antidotes) and wisdom (emptiness) together all the time - the two accumulations; only then is it in accord with reality, with the two inseparable truths (not existence, not non- existence, not both, not neither)..CHAPTER 7 - ABANDONING ATTACHMENT TO SENSE OBJECTS (THE WHOLE SAMSARA) - THE MIDDLE WAY IN VIRTUOUS ACTIONS AND HAPPY REBIRTHS / SENSE OBJECTS: not grasping at any path, virtuous methods or the sense objects of happy rebirths, as if inherently existing, and not rejecting completely all virtues, all paths, as if useless (falling into the other extreme, nihilism). All actions are contaminated; all methods, virtuous or not, are ultimately creating bad karma; all higher rebirths will eventually end up in the lower realms. But, without accumulating enough merit, we do not have the requires conditions to develop insights, to directly realize the real nature of everything, and be totally Liberated; so, we will end un in those lower realms. What we need is both virtuous methods and wisdom together, the two accumulations. We need to perfect all Bodhisattva virtues / paramitas111 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]by practicing them while realizing the emptiness of the three: subject, action, object. There is no absolute method, only adapted skillful means that need to be combined with wisdom..CHAPTER 8 - THOROUGHLY PREPARING THE STUDENT - THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT TEACHING AND THE WAY TO GAIN LIBERATION: not grasping at any view or teaching, like dependent origination or emptiness, as if they were the absolute truth to be presented in all cases; and not rejecting all views completely as if useless (falling into the other extreme, nihilism). Liberation is not gained by getting to a final view, or by dropping all views and methods. Liberations is gained by realizing that the source of all disturbing emotions are empty of inherent existence because dependently arisen (one implying the other). Until then, and to get there, we need a gradual path composed of both skillful means (virtuous methods) and wisdom adapted to the students and their actual conditioning (karma). It is usually better to start with the teachings of virtues and the law of dependent origination, not directly with subtle emptiness, because there is a high risk of provoking total rejection of all teachings or nihilism...L3: [PART II - Explaining the stages of the paths dependent on ULTIMATE TRUTH (accumulation of wisdom)]L4: [SECTION II - A - Extensively explaining ultimate truth.].CHAPTER 9 - REFUTING PERMANENT FUNCTIONAL PHENOMENA - THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT CAUSALITY, DETERMINISM, THE NEED FOR A PATH TO CAUSE LIBERATION: There is no absolute, permanent, inherent causes, effects, causality. But, on the other hand, conventionally speaking, nothing functional is without a cause, there is no effect without a cause, and no cause without an effect. All functional things are conventionally both cause and effect, dependently arisen and functional. So there is no absolute path, as a cause for Liberation, but still the conventional / relative paths are not useless, or without any effect at all - they are useful in reducing the negative consequences of accumulating bad karma. As for Liberation, it is not a functional thing; it is not an effect caused by any possible causes and conditions, or path, nor a cause of something else. Liberation is beyond causality space and time. It is about directly seeing the real nature of all of those. It is more like space, a negation that is not affirming anything..CHAPTER 10 - REFUTING MISCONCEPTIONS OF THE SELF - THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT THE SELF AND FREE WILL: There is nothing permanent or inherently existing that is creating karma, accumulating karma, having rebirths, and possibly being liberated. There is no inherent self. But this doesn't mean that there is completely no self at all, that there is no continuity of actions and their consequences in samsara, or that there is no possible Liberation at all. In fact, there is no need for any kind of permanent self to explain interdependence, continuity, memories, the cycle of the five aggregates and karma (the rebirths in samsara), the possibility of Liberation through a Noble Path. On the contrary a permanent self would not be able to produce impermanent effects, and would not care about any morality or path. And it is this belief in a permanent self that is the very root cause of all suffering. The mere functionality of the self proves its impermanence, its dependence, that it is both a cause and an effect, merely imputed by the mind. Liberation, like explained in chapter 8, is gained by accumulating both merit (through virtuous methods based on dependent origination), and wisdom (gradually realizing the emptiness of inherent existence of all dharmas, the inseparability of the Two Truths) together. So the self is not inherently existing, not completely non-existent, not both, not neither..CHAPTER 11 - REFUTING TRULY EXISTENT TIME - THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT TIME: avoiding both extremes: not thinking it is absolute / existing, not thinking it is completely non-existent. There is no need for any kind of permanent time to explain interdependence, continuity, memories, the cycle of the five aggregates and karma (the rebirths in samsara), the possibility of Liberation through a Noble Path. On the contrary permanent past, present and future would negate the possibility of change, production, causality, morality, a path. Future cannot exist (now) otherwise there would be no need for further production, no need to work on it. Past and future cannot exist (now) otherwise they are not past and future. As for present, it is defined as actual duration of something (after origination, and before cessation), but this duration cannot be found because nothing can be found to exist by itself. There is no absolute basis for the definition and measurement of time. Even assuming the momentary model, duration or time cannot be directly seen. Time and duration (time interval) are two co-dependently arisen concepts. Even impermanence is not an absolute attribute; to say something exist (duration) and change (or is impermanent) is contradictory. Duration and impermanence are not two separate attributes, nor the same. A Yogi cannot see past and future as if they were truly existing; a Buddha does directly see the real non-dual nature of everything, the beginningless and endless flow of interdependence without any inherent existence in it. Things and time, defined on their duration, do not inherently exist; but they exist conventionally with all the imperfection that this brings..112 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]CHAPTER 12 - REFUTING WRONG VIEWS - THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT VIEWS: There is no final absolute view that is proposed here, no superficial absolute system easy to assimilate by ordinary people. On the contrary all views are said to be flawed, because based one way of another onto something inherently existing, which is contrary to the real non-dual nature of everything. But that doesn't mean that no system at all is proposed here, or that we should drop everything right now, or that everything is useless and meaningless. Emptiness doesn't deny dependent origination, or vice versa. While being in samsara, we still need adapted progressive skillful means combining both methods (based on non-violence) and wisdom (based on the emptiness of inherent existence) together in order to create the proper conditions, and ultimately to be able to see though all of our own conditioning (karma), and get completely Liberated from the whole samsara. - The chosen path need to be gradual because, there are prerequisites (open- mindness, intelligence, enough accumulated merit, humility, compassion) before someone could be taught the subtle emptiness. Because of accumulated karma, pride, conceit and grasping at one's own view through habituation, to start with emptiness may create too much resistance, total rejection, or a fall into nihilism. On the other hand, only the realization of the emptiness of our own mind and of everything is the final antidote to all disturbing emotions; so all paths will always converge toward this point. Once we realize emptiness, all attachments and fears drop by themselves automatically; artificially dropping all attachments would not work, no more than superficial methods based on the ego. - The system proposed here is not absolute; it is also perceived as empty dependently arisen adapted skillful means. It doesn't have to be absolute (inherently existing) in the usual sense to be efficient; it cannot be. But it has to be based on the real non-dual nature of everything, which is not describable because beyond all conceptualization; but which we know, from the Buddha, that it is : not existence, not non-existence, not both, not neither. So the perfection of any path is the combination of both more and more subtle methods and wisdom together all the time. Only then is it a valid Buddhist path..CHAPTER 13 - REFUTING TRULY EXISTENT SENSE ORGANS AND OBJECTS - REFUTING DIRECT PERCEPTION OF AN OBJECTIVE REALITY INDEPENDENT OF THE MIND - Refuting the assumption that there are truly existing objects because we have direct objective perception of them. The Middle Way about a perception, senses and consciousness: there is no objective direct perception of an external reality by impartial sense organs and consciousnesses, but there is relative or conventional perception conditioned by our own accumulated karma. All objects of the three realms (desire, form, non-form / body, speech and mind) are empty of inherent existence, merely imputed by the mind, like illusions. But that doesn't mean that everything is completely non-existent; they exist conventionally, in co-dependence with our own mind. Everything is dependent on the mind, but not from the mind only. The way perception works is that we always perceive the basis first (the parts); then label the object; then have the impression of directly seeing the object -- the same for the parts themselves. Everything is both whole and parts; and everything is empty of inherent existence because dependent on its parts, because dependent on the mind labeling it and recognizing it, dependent on our own accumulated karma / conditioning. The world and the mind are both empty of inherent existence because interdependent, non-dual: not two, not one. So the perfection of perception is something like to realize the inseparability of appearances and mind, the inseparability of The Two Truths..CHAPTER 14 - REFUTING EXTREME CONCEPTIONS [OF EXISTENCE, NON-EXISTENCE, BOTH, AND NEITHER] - THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT ALL DUALITIES, ALL OPPOSITES, ALL FOUR EXTREMES: All objects of the three worlds, including all characteristics or pseudo elementary components, are: not inherently existent, not completely non-existent; not both; not neither; because they are all co-dependently arisen, interdependent, merely imputed by the mind. All dualities (like: whole & parts/characteristics, cause & effect, pure & impure, body & mind, world & mind, appearances & emptiness, the Two Truths, dependent origination & emptiness, samsara & Nirvana, right & left, etc.) are non-dual: one side doesn't include the other, nor are they different, or the same. Or for some dualities: it is not the case that one side is true and the other false, or that both are true, or that both are false. All opposites, all relations are like that, non-dual: not two, not one. This Tetralemma, describing the four extremes that should be avoided as absolute position, also describes the four possible skillful means or antidotes that could be used if understood as merely relative, conventional, not absolute. In the case of any duality, the wise would not accept any of the four possible positions as an absolute, nor would he reject them all, because then that would be falling into the fourth position, nihilism. He would not accept the duality as inherently existing, not reject it completely as if non-existent or useless. That is the Middle Way about any duality. No absolute, only adapted skillful means. And this is the method to solve all problems related to inherent existence and dualities: to prove that the four positions leads to absurdity if taken as absolute, and to be ready to use any of them as a skillful means when required. It means not discriminating thinking there is an absolute basis for objective discrimination, not non-discriminating thinking there is no basis at all for discrimination and that it would be useless. Transcending the two poles of any duality means realizing their interdependence, their emptiness, and thus not accepting the duality nor rejecting it. -- As we will see, the perfection of wisdom, of understanding Dependent Origination and Emptiness (another duality), consist of realizing their non-duality113 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2](not two, not one), their inseparability, the perfect Union of the Two Truths beyond all conceptualization..CHAPTER 15 - REFUTING TRULY EXISTENT CHARACTERISTICS [OF PRODUCTS] - PRODUCTION / ORIGINATION, DURATION, CESSATION - THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT DEPENDENT ORIGINATION / PRODUCTION: there is no possible direct observation of inherent production, origination, duration and cessation, because inherent cause & effect are impossible; they cannot exist separately or at the same time; they could not be different or the same; they are all interdependent, merely imputed by the mind. The time of production itself cannot be pinpointed. It means all production should be seen like an illusion. So the law of dependent origination itself, the Wheel of Life, also have to be reinterpreted with more wisdom (emptiness) like in the case of methods and virtues. But that doesn't mean that they are totally non-existent - or that the teaching of dependent origination is completely false and should be dropped; that all paths based on it should be dropped right now. There is still conventional production, origination, duration, cessation; conventionally objects of the three realms still exist and should still be considered impermanent. The model of dependent origination as explained by the Buddha is still valid/ useful while being in samsara; it is just that it should be understood as implying no inherently existent cause, effect, or causality in it. No absolute truth here either. This teaching is also another adapted skillful means, a conventional truth. It is useful as a temporary imperfect model, as a framework to explain the causes of suffering and the path leading toward happiness; but it should not be grasped on as if it was an absolute truth, as if its elements were absolute or inherently existing. This mistake would inhibit the full completion of the path and the attainment of complete Enlightenment. So, even if there is no absolute dependent origination, we still need a gradual path composed of more and more subtle methods and wisdom; in order to get more and more in accord with the real non-dual nature of everything, creating less and less causes for suffering / karma. -- Things are not inherently produced; they do not last, grow old, and then ceased and completely become non-existent; that is true only conventionally. So, the perfection of Dependent Origination, beyond conceptualization, is to unite it with Emptiness. That is the meaning of the Union of The Two Truths, their inseparability..L4: [SECTION II - B - Showing how to meditate on settling [the procedure between] spiritual guides and students by way of [explaining] the purpose of the CHAPTERs and eliminating remaining counter-arguments by misguided opponents.].CHAPTER 16 - REFUTING REMAINING COUNTER-ARGUMENTS - THE MIDDLE WAY ABOUT EMPTINESS: emptiness itself is empty of inherent existence; it is not the absolute truth, the final system which is beyond any description, beyond any conceptualization. All objects of the three realms (desire, form, non-form, or body, speech and mind) are all empty of inherent existence. There is no exception. Even the three causal Gems (Buddha, Dharma and Sangha) are empty of inherent existence. They are all empty because interdependent, co-dependently arisen concepts, merely imputed by the mind. But, again, this doesn't mean that everything is inherently existing because emptiness is empty; or that everything is completely non-existent, useless because everything is empty; or that we should drop everything right now. Emptiness doesn't deny dependent origination, or vice versa; they are not mutually exclusive; on the contrary, they imply each other. Even if everything is empty of inherent existence, everything is still dependently arisen and functional, useful like Buddha activities if seen for what they really are, if used while realizing the emptiness of the three: subject, object, action. -- Emptiness is irrefutable because it doesn't pretend to be an absolute system, to be inherently existing. As a concept, as the antidote to inherent existence, it is just another conventional truth, another adapted skillful means. It is a concept co-dependently arisen with the concept of inherent existence, or with the concept of dependent origination based on inherently existing causes and effects as explained in the Abhidharma. They come together, and they go together: without anymore belief in inherent existence or absolute production / dependent origination, there is no more need for its antidote, emptiness; and vice versa, without the danger of falling into the extreme of nihilism, thinking that emptiness is an absolute, there is no more need for the proof of dependent origination. Dependent Origination and Emptiness form an apparent duality, like existence and non-existence, like method and wisdom, like the Two Truths, like pure and impure, like Nirvana and Samsara. But their real nature is non-dual: not two, not one; not different, not the same; inseparability. Their real nature is beyond any description, beyond all conceptualization; only a Buddha has realized their real non-dual nature. So, the perfection of Emptiness, beyond conceptualization, is to unite it with Dependent Origination. That is the meaning of the Union of The Two Truths, their inseparability. And the perfection of the perception of all objects of the three realms is to see their non-duality, and the inseparability of the three realms. The perfection of those objects (body, speech and mind) are the three inseparable resulting Gems, the inseparable trikaya.ONE LAST WORD: as I understand it today, there is nothing to do, nothing to not do, nothing to get, nothing to drop, nothing to see, nothing to not see. Nirvana is not caused by our own effort or dropping. Nothing gets perfected, nothing gets purified, nothing becomes united or inseparable. Everything is already like that. Everything is already pure; everything is equal, non-dual, in emptiness. We already have the Buddha-nature, the inseparable trikaya. The three114 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]realms have always been inseparable. Nirvana is not somewhere else different than samsara, nor is it the same. It is just a matter of directly seeing the real nature of our own mind and thus of everything as they really are right now (but to be able to see this we need enough merit, and a path to get there). And directly seeing this is not like perceiving something, or like understanding something; they say it is like seeing luminous space: a negation that is affirming nothing, not even nothingness. The closer we can get using concept is to say that there is no inherent existence, but still conventional dependent origination and functionality; or not existence, not non-existence, not both, not neither; or the Union of The Two Truths; or inseparability of appearances and emptiness; etc.~ Karikas 25:24~ "The cessation of accepting everything [as real]~ is a salutary (siva) cessation of phenomenal development (prapanca);~ No dharma anywhere has been taught by the Buddha of anything." ..115 / 117Aryadeva - The Treatise of the Four Hundred Stanzas on the Yogic Deeds of Bodhisattvas [3.2]L2: [Re?sume?
