           FRAGMENT A.

  Many men seyn that in sweveninges
  Ther nis but fables and lesinges;
  But men may somme swevenes seen,
  Which hardely ne false been,
  But afterward ben apparaunte.                   5
  This may I drawe to waraunte
  An authour, that hight Macrobes,
  That halt not dremes false ne lees,
  But undoth us the avisioun
  That whylom mette king Cipioun.                10
    And who-so sayth, or weneth it be
  A Iape, or elles [a] nycetee
  To wene that dremes after falle,
  Let who-so liste a fool me calle.

  That fallen after al openly.                    20
    Within my twenty yere of age,         THE DREAM.
  Whan that Love taketh his corage
  Of yonge folk, I wente sone
  To bedde, as I was wont to done,
  And fast I sleep; and in sleping,               25
  Me mette swiche a swevening,
  That lykede me wonders wel;
  But in that sweven is never a del
  That it nis afterward befalle,
  Right as this dreem wol telle us alle.          30
  Now this dreem wol I ryme aright,
  To make your hertes gaye and light;
  For Love it prayeth, and also
  Commaundeth me that it be so
  And if ther any aske me,                        35

  And in the water anoon was sene
  His nose, his mouth, his yen shene,
  And he ther-of was al abasshed;

  Of a child of greet beautee.

      Ung jour qu'il venoit d'archoier,         1480

  Wel couthe Love him wreke tho
  Of daunger and of pryde also,

  That, shortly al the sothe to telle,

  That atte laste he starf for wo.              1530

  That with an hegge aboute enclos is.

  Whan I was with this rage hent,
  That caught hath many a man and shent,
  Toward the roser gan I go.
  And whan I was not fer therfro,               1660
  The savour of the roses swote
  Me smoot right to the herte rote,
  As I hadde al embawmed [be.]

  And lest it greved or for-thoughte
  The lord that thilke gardyn wroughte.
  Of roses were ther gret woon,

          FRAGMENT B.

  Whan I had smelled the savour swote,
  No wille hadde I fro thens yit go,
  But somdel neer it wente I tho,
  To take it; but myn hond, for drede,
  Ne dorste I to the rose bede,                     1710
  For thistels sharpe, of many maneres,
  Netles, thornes, and hoked breres;
  [Ful] muche they distourbled me,
  For sore I dradde to harmed be.
    The God of Love, with bowe bent,                1715
  That al day set hadde his talent
  To pursuen and to spyen me,
  Was stonding by a fige-tree.
  And whan he sawe how that I
  Had chosen so ententifly                          1720
  The botoun, more unto my pay
  Than any other that I say,
  He took an arowe ful sharply whet,
  And in his bowe whan it was set,
  He streight up to his ere drough                  1725
  The stronge bowe, that was so tough,
  And shet at me so wonder smerte,
  That through myn eye unto myn herte
  The takel smoot, and depe it wente.
  And ther-with-al such cold me hente,              1730
  That, under clothes warme and softe,
  Sith that day I have chevered ofte.
    Whan I was hurt thus in [that] stounde,
  I fel doun plat unto the grounde.
  Myn herte failed and feynted ay,                  1735
  And long tyme [ther] a-swone I lay.
  But whan I com out of swoning,
  And hadde wit, and my feling,
  I was al maat, and wende ful wel
  Of blood have loren a ful gret del.               1740
  But certes, the arowe that in me stood
  Of me ne drew no drope of blood,
  For-why I found my wounde al dreye.
  Than took I with myn hondis tweye
  The arowe, and ful fast out it plight,            1745
  And in the pulling sore I sight.
  So at the last the shaft of tree
  I drough out, with the fethers three.
  But yet the hoked heed, y-wis,
  The whiche Beautee callid is,                     1750
  Gan so depe in myn herte passe,
  That I it mighte nought arace;
  But in myn herte stille it stood,
  Al bledde I not a drope of blood.
  I was bothe anguissous and trouble                1755
  For the peril that I saw double;
  I niste what to seye or do,
  Ne gete a leche my woundis to;
  For neithir thurgh gras ne rote,
  Ne hadde I help of hope ne bote.                  1760
  But to the botoun ever-mo
  Myn herte drew; for al my wo,
  My thought was in non other thing.
  For hadde it been in my keping,
  It wolde have brought my lyf agayn.               1765
  For certeinly, I dar wel seyn,
  The sight only, and the savour,
  Alegged muche of my langour.
    Than gan I for to drawe me
  Toward the botoun fair to see;                    1770
  And Love hadde gete him, in [a] throwe,
  Another arowe into his bowe,
  And for to shete gan him dresse;
  The arowis name was Simplesse.
  And whan that Love gan nyghe me nere,             1775
  He drow it up, withouten were,
  And shet at me with al his might,
  So that this arowe anon-right
  Thourghout [myn] eigh, as it was founde,
  Into myn herte hath maad a wounde.                1780
  Thanne I anoon dide al my crafte
  For to drawen out the shafte,
  And ther-with-al I sighed eft.
  But in myn herte the heed was left,
  Which ay encresid my desyre,                      1785
  Unto the botoun drawe nere;
  And ever, mo that me was wo,
  The more desyr hadde I to go
  Unto the roser, where that grew
  The fresshe botoun so bright of hewe.             1790
  Betir me were have leten be;
  But it bihoved nedes me
  To don right as myn herte bad.
  For ever the body must be lad
  Aftir the herte; in wele and wo,                  1795
  Of force togidre they must go.
  But never this archer wolde fyne
  To shete at me with alle his pyne,
  And for to make me to him mete.
    The thridde arowe he gan to shete,              1800
  Whan best his tyme he mighte espye,
  The which was named Curtesye;
  Into myn herte it dide avale.
  A-swone I fel, bothe deed and pale;
  Long tyme I lay, and stired nought,               1805
  Til I abraid out of my thought.
  And faste than I avysed me
  To drawen out the shafte of tree;
  But ever the heed was left bihinde
  For ought I couthe pulle or winde.                1810
  So sore it stikid whan I was hit,
  That by no craft I might it flit;
  But anguissous and ful of thought,
  I felte such wo, my wounde ay wrought,
  That somoned me alway to go                       1815
  Toward the rose, that plesed me so;
  But I ne durste in no manere,
  Bicause the archer was so nere.
  For evermore gladly, as I rede,
  Brent child of fyr hath muche drede.              1820
  And, certis yit, for al my peyne,
  Though that I sigh yit arwis reyne,
  And grounde quarels sharpe of stele,
  Ne for no payne that I might fele,
  Yit might I not my-silf withholde                 1825
  The faire roser to biholde;
  For Love me yaf sich hardement
  For to fulfille his comaundement.
  Upon my feet I roos up than
  Feble, as a forwoundid man;                       1830
  And forth to gon [my] might I sette,
  And for the archer nolde I lette.
  Toward the roser fast I drow;
  But thornes sharpe mo than y-now
  Ther were, and also thistels thikke,              1835
  And breres, brimme for to prikke,
  That I ne mighte gete grace
  The rowe thornes for to passe,
  To sene the roses fresshe of hewe.
  I must abide, though it me rewe,                  1840
  The hegge aboute so thikke was,
  That closid the roses in compas.
    But o thing lyked me right wele;
  I was so nygh, I mighte fele
  Of the botoun the swote odour,                    1845
  And also see the fresshe colour;
  And that right gretly lyked me,
  That I so neer it mighte see.
  Sich Ioye anoon therof hadde I,
  That I forgat my malady.                          1850
  To sene [it] hadde I sich delyt,
  Of sorwe and angre I was al quit,
  And of my woundes that I had thar;
  For no-thing lyken me might mar
  Than dwellen by the roser ay,                     1855
  And thennes never to passe away.
    But whan a whyle I had be thar,
  The God of Love, which al to-shar
  Myn herte with his arwis kene,
  Caste him to yeve me woundis grene.               1860
  He shet at me ful hastily
  An arwe named Company,
  The whiche takel is ful able
  To make these ladies merciable.
  Than I anoon gan chaungen hewe                    1865
  For grevaunce of my wounde newe,
  That I agayn fel in swoning,
  And sighed sore in compleyning.
  Sore I compleyned that my sore
  On me gan greven more and more.                   1870
  I had non hope of allegeaunce;
  So nigh I drow to desperaunce,
  I rought of dethe ne of lyf,
  Whither that love wolde me dryf.
  If me a martir wolde he make,                     1875
  I might his power nought forsake.
  And whyl for anger thus I wook,
  The God of Love an arowe took;
  Ful sharp it was and [ful] pugnaunt,
  And it was callid Fair-Semblaunt,                 1880
  The which in no wys wol consente,
  That any lover him repente
  To serve his love with herte and alle,
  For any peril that may bifalle.
  But though this arwe was kene grounde             1885
  As any rasour that is founde,
  To cutte and kerve, at the poynt,
  The God of Love it hadde anoynt
  With a precious oynement,
  Somdel to yeve aleggement                         1890
  Upon the woundes that he had
  Through the body in my herte maad,
  To helpe hir sores, and to cure,
  And that they may the bet endure.
  But yit this arwe, withoute more,                 1895
  Made in myn herte a large sore,
  That in ful gret peyne I abood.
  But ay the oynement wente abrood;
  Throughout my woundes large and wyde
  It spredde aboute in every syde;                  1900
  Through whos vertu and whos might
  Myn herte Ioyful was and light.
  I had ben deed and al to-shent
  But for the precious oynement.
  The shaft I drow out of the arwe,                 1905
  Roking for wo right wondir narwe;
  But the heed, which made me smerte,
  Lefte bihinde in myn herte
  With other foure, I dar wel say,
  That never wol be take away;                      1910
  But the oynement halp me wele.
  And yit sich sorwe dide I fele,
  That al-day I chaunged hewe,
  Of my woundes fresshe and newe,
  As men might see in my visage.                    1915
  The arwis were so fulle of rage,
  So variaunt of diversitee,
  That men in everich mighte see
  Bothe gret anoy and eek swetnesse,
  And Ioye meynt with bittirnesse.                  1920
  Now were they esy, now were they wood,
  In hem I felte bothe harm and good;
  Now sore without aleggement,
  Now softening with oynement;
  It softned here, and prikked there,               1925
  Thus ese and anger togider were.
    The God of Love deliverly
  Com lepand to me hastily,
  And seide to me, in gret rape,
 'Yeld thee, for thou may not escape!               1930
  May no defence availe thee here;
  Therfore I rede mak no daungere.
  If thou wolt yelde thee hastily,
  Thou shalt [the] rather have mercy.
  He is a fool in sikernesse,                       1935
  That with daunger or stoutnesse
  Rebellith ther that he shulde plese;
  In such folye is litel ese.
  Be meek, wher thou must nedis bowe;
  To stryve ageyn is nought thy prowe.              1940
  Come at ones, and have y-do,
  For I wol that it be so.
  Than yeld thee here debonairly.'
  And I answerid ful humbly,
 'Gladly, sir; at your bidding,                     1945
  I wol me yelde in alle thing.
  To your servyse I wol me take;
  For god defende that I shulde make
  Ageyn your bidding resistence;
  I wol not doon so gret offence;                   1950
  For if I dide, it were no skile.
  Ye may do with me what ye wile,
  Save or spille, and also sloo;
  Fro you in no wyse may I go.
  My lyf, my deth, is in your honde,                1955
  I may not laste out of your bonde.
  Pleyn at your list I yelde me,
  Hoping in herte, that sumtyme ye
  Comfort and ese shulle me sende;
  Or ellis shortly, this is the ende,               1960
  Withouten helthe I moot ay dure,
  But-if ye take me to your cure.
  Comfort or helthe how shuld I have,
  Sith ye me hurte, but ye me save?
  The helthe of lovers moot be founde               1965
  Wher-as they token firste hir wounde.
  And if ye list of me to make
  Your prisoner, I wol it take
  Of herte and wil, fully at gree.
  Hoolly and pleyn I yelde me,                      1970
  Withoute feyning or feyntyse,
  To be governed by your empryse.
  Of you I here so much prys,
  I wol ben hool at your devys
  For to fulfille your lyking                       1975
  And repente for no-thing,
  Hoping to have yit in som tyde
  Mercy, of that [that] I abyde.'
  And with that covenaunt yeld I me,
  Anoon doun kneling upon my knee,                  1980
  Profering for to kisse his feet;
  But for no-thing he wolde me lete,
  And seide, 'I love thee bothe and preyse,
  Sen that thyn answer doth me ese,
  For thou answerid so curteisly.                   1985
  For now I wot wel uttirly,
  That thou art gentil, by thy speche.
  For though a man fer wolde seche,
  He shulde not finden, in certeyn,
  No sich answer of no vileyn;                      1990
  For sich a word ne mighte nought
  Isse out of a vilayns thought.
  Thou shalt not lesen of thy speche,
  For [to] thy helping wol I eche,
  And eek encresen that I may.                      1995
  But first I wol that thou obay
  Fully, for thyn avauntage,
  Anon to do me here homage.
  And sithen kisse thou shalt my mouth,
  Which to no vilayn was never couth                2000
  For to aproche it, ne for to touche;
  For sauf of cherlis I ne vouche
  That they shulle never neigh it nere.
  For curteys, and of fair manere,
  Wel taught, and ful of gentilnesse                2005
  He muste ben, that shal me kisse,
  And also of ful high fraunchyse,
  That shal atteyne to that empryse.
    And first of o thing warne I thee,
  That peyne and gret adversitee                    2010
  He mot endure, and eek travaile,
  That shal me serve, withoute faile.
  But ther-ageyns, thee to comforte,
  And with thy servise to desporte,
  Thou mayst ful glad and Ioyful be                 2015
  So good a maister to have as me,
  And lord of so high renoun.
  I bere of Love the gonfanoun,
  Of Curtesye the banere;
  For I am of the silf manere,                      2020
  Gentil, curteys, meek and free;
  That who [so] ever ententif be
  Me to honoure, doute, and serve,
  And also that he him observe
  Fro trespas and fro vilanye,                      2025
  And him governe in curtesye
  With wil and with entencioun;
  For whan he first in my prisoun
  Is caught, than muste he uttirly,
  Fro thennes-forth ful bisily,                     2030
  Caste him gentil for to be,
  If he desyre helpe of me.'
    Anoon withouten more delay,
  Withouten daunger or affray,
  I bicom his man anoon,                            2035
  And gave him thankes many a oon,
  And kneled doun with hondis Ioynt,
  And made it in my port ful queynt;
  The Ioye wente to myn herte rote.
  Whan I had kissed his mouth so swote,             2040
  I had sich mirthe and sich lyking,
  It cured me of languisshing.
  He askid of me than hostages:--
  I have,' he seide, 'taken fele homages
  Of oon and other, where I have been               2045
  Disceyved ofte, withouten wene.
  These felouns, fulle of falsitee,
  Have many sythes bigyled me,
  And through falshede hir lust acheved,
  Wherof I repente and am agreved.                  2050
  And I hem gete in my daungere,
  Hir falshed shulie they bye ful dere.
  But for I love thee, I seye thee pleyn,
  I wol of thee be more certeyn;
  For thee so sore I wol now binde,                 2055
  That thou away ne shalt not winde
  For to denyen the covenaunt,
  Or doon that is not avenaunt.
  That thou were fals it were gret reuthe,
  Sith thou semest so ful of treuthe.'              2060
   'Sire, if thee list to undirstande,
  I merveile thee asking this demande.
  For-why or wherfore shulde ye
  Ostages or borwis aske of me,
  Or any other sikirnesse,                          2065
  Sith ye wote, in sothfastnesse,
  That ye have me surprysed so,
  And hool myn herte taken me fro,
  That it wol do for me no-thing
  But-if it be at your bidding?                     2070
  Myn herte is yours, and myn right nought,
  As it bihoveth, in dede and thought,
  Redy in alle to worche your wille,
  Whether so [it] turne to good or ille.
  So sore it lustith you to plese,                  2075
  No man therof may you disseise.
  Ye have theron set sich Iustise,
  That it is werreyd in many wise.
  And if ye doute it nolde obeye,
  Ye may therof do make a keye,                     2080
  And holde it with you for ostage.'
  Now certis, this is noon outrage,'
  Quoth Love, 'and fully I accord;
  For of the body he is ful lord
  That hath the herte in his tresor;                2085
  Outrage it were to asken more.'
    Than of his aumener he drough
  A litel keye, fetys y-nough,
  Which was of gold polisshed clere,
  And seide to me, 'With this keye here             2090
  Thyn herte to me now wol I shette;
  For al my Iowellis loke and knette
  I binde under this litel keye,
  That no wight may carye aweye;
  This keye is ful of gret poeste.'                 2095
  With which anoon he touchid me
  Undir the syde ful softely,
  That he myn herte sodeynly
  Without [al] anoy had spered,
  That yit right nought it hath me dered.           2100
  Whan he had doon his wil al-out,
  And I had put him out of dout,
  Sire,' I seide, 'I have right gret wille
  Your lust and plesaunce to fulfille.
  Loke ye my servise take at gree,                  2105
  By thilke feith ye owe to me.
  I seye nought for recreaundyse,
  For I nought doute of your servyse.
  But the servaunt traveileth in vayne,
  That for to serven doth his payne                 2110
  Unto that lord, which in no wyse
  Can him no thank for his servyse.'
    Love seide, 'Dismaye thee nought,
  Sin thou for sucour hast me sought,
  In thank thy servise wol I take,                  2115
  And high of degree I wol thee make,
  If wikkidnesse ne hindre thee;
  But, as I hope, it shal nought be.
  To worship no wight by aventure
  May come, but-if he peyne endure.                 2120
  Abyde and suffre thy distresse;
  That hurtith now, it shal be lesse;
  I wot my-silf what may thee save,
  What medicyne thou woldist have.
  And if thy trouthe to me thou kepe,               2125
  I shal unto thyn helping eke,
  To cure thy woundes and make hem clene,
  Wher-so they be olde or grene;
  Thou shalt be holpen, at wordis fewe.
  For certeynly thou shalt wel shewe                2130
  Wher that thou servest with good wille,
  For to complisshen and fulfille
  My comaundementis, day and night,
  Whiche I to lovers yeve of right.'
   'Ah, sire, for goddis love,' seide I,            2135
  Er ye passe hens, ententifly
  Your comaundementis to me ye say,
  And I shal kepe hem, if I may;
  For hem to kepen is al my thought.
  And if so be I wot hem nought,                    2140
  Than may I [sinne] unwitingly.
  Wherfore I pray you enterely,
  With al myn herte, me to lere,
  That I trespasse in no manere.'
    The god of love than chargid me                 2145
  Anoon, as ye shal here and see,
  Word by word, by right empryse,
  So as the Romance shal devyse.
    The maister lesith his tyme to lere,
  Whan the disciple wol not here.                   2150
  It is but veyn on him to swinke,
  That on his lerning wol not thinke.
  Who-so lust love, let him entende,
  For now the Romance ginneth amende.
  Now is good to here, in fay,                      2155
  If any be that can it say,
  And poynte it as the resoun is
  Set; for other-gate, y-wis,
  It shal nought wel in alle thing
  Be brought to good undirstonding:                 2160
  For a reder that poyntith ille
  A good sentence may ofte spille.
  The book is good at the ending,
  Maad of newe and lusty thing;
  For who-so wol the ending here,                   2165
  The crafte of love he shal now lere,
  If that he wol so long abyde,
  Til I this Romance may unhyde,
  And undo the signifiaunce
  Of this dreme into Romaunce.                      2170
  The sothfastnesse that now is hid,
  Without coverture shal be kid,
  Whan I undon have this dreming,
  Wherin no word is of lesing.
   'Vilany, at the biginning,                       2175
  I wol,' sayd Love, 'over alle thing,
  Thou leve, if thou wolt [not] be
  Fals, and trespasse ageynes me.
  I curse and blame generally
  Alle hem that loven vilany;                       2180
  For vilany makith vilayn,
  And by his dedis a cherle is seyn.
  Thise vilayns arn without pitee,
  Frendshipe, love, and al bounte.
  I nil receyve to my servyse                       2185
  Hem that ben vilayns of empryse.
   'But undirstonde in thyn entent,
  That this is not myn entendement,
  To clepe no wight in no ages
  Only gentil for his linages.                      2190
  But who-so [that] is vertuous,
  And in his port nought outrageous,
  Whan sich oon thou seest thee biforn,
  Though he be not gentil born,
  Thou mayst wel seyn, this is a soth,              2195
  That he is gentil, bicause he doth
  As longeth to a gentilman;
  Of hem non other deme I can.
  For certeynly, withouten drede,
  A cherl is demed by his dede,                     2200
  Of hye or lowe, as ye may see,
  Or of what kinrede that he be.
  Ne say nought, for noon yvel wille,
  Thing that is to holden stille;
  It is no worship to misseye.                      2205
  Thou mayst ensample take of Keye,
  That was somtyme, for misseying,
  Hated bothe of olde and ying;
  As fer as Gaweyn, the worthy,
  Was preysed for his curtesy,                      2210
  Keye was hated, for he was fel,
  Of word dispitous and cruel.
  Wherfore be wyse and aqueyntable,
  Goodly of word, and resonable
  Bothe to lesse and eek to mar.                    2215
  And whan thou comest ther men ar,
  Loke that thou have in custom ay
  First to salue hem, if thou may:
  And if it falle, that of hem som
  Salue thee first, be not dom,                     2220
  But quyte him curteisly anoon
  Without abiding, er they goon.
   'For no-thing eek thy tunge applye
  To speke wordis of ribaudye.
  To vilayn speche in no degree                     2225
  Lat never thy lippe unbounden be.
  For I nought holde him, in good feith,
  Curteys, that foule wordis seith.
  And alle wimmen serve and preyse,
  And to thy power hir honour reyse.                2230
  And if that any missayere
  Dispyse wimmen, that thou mayst here,
  Blame him, and bidde him holde him stille.
  And set thy might and al thy wille
  Wimmen and ladies for to plese,                   2235
  And to do thing that may hem ese,
  That they ever speke good of thee,
  For so thou mayst best preysed be.
   'Loke fro pryde thou kepe thee wele;
  For thou mayst bothe perceyve and fele,           2240
  That pryde is bothe foly and sinne;
  And he that pryde hath, him withinne,
  Ne may his herte, in no wyse,
  Meken ne souplen to servyse.
  For pryde is founde, in every part,               2245
  Contrarie unto Loves art.
  And he that loveth trewely
  Shulde him contene Iolily,
  Withouten pryde in sondry wyse,
  And him disgysen in queyntyse.                    2250
  For queynt array, withouten drede,
  Is no-thing proud, who takith hede;
  For fresh array, as men may see,
  Withouten pryde may ofte be.
   'Mayntene thy-silf aftir thy rent,               2255
  Of robe and eek of garnement;
  For many sythe fair clothing
  A man amendith in mich thing.
  And loke alwey that they be shape,
  What garnement that thou shalt make,              2260
  Of him that can [hem] beste do,
  With al that perteyneth therto.
  Poyntis and sleves be wel sittand,
  Right and streight upon the hand.
  Of shoon and botes, newe and faire,               2265
  Loke at the leest thou have a paire;
  And that they sitte so fetisly,
  That these rude may uttirly
  Merveyle, sith that they sitte so pleyn,
  How they come on or of ageyn.                     2270
  Were streite gloves, with aumenere
  Of silk; and alwey with good chere
  Thou yeve, if thou have richesse;
  And if thou have nought, spend the lesse.
  Alwey be mery, if thou may,                       2275
  But waste not thy good alway.
  Have hat of floures fresh as May,
  Chapelet of roses of Whitsonday;
  For sich array ne cost but lyte.
  Thyn hondis wasshe, thy teeth make whyte,         2280
  And let no filthe upon thee be.
  Thy nailes blak if thou mayst see,
  Voide it awey deliverly,
  And kembe thyn heed right Iolily.
  [Fard] not thy visage in no wyse,                 2285
  For that of love is not thempryse;
  For love doth haten, as I finde,
  A beaute that cometh not of kinde.
  Alwey in herte I rede thee
  Glad and mery for to be,                          2290
  And be as Ioyful as thou can;
  Love hath no Ioye of sorowful man.
  That yvel is ful of curtesye
  That [lauhwith] in his maladye;
  For ever of love the siknesse                     2295
  Is meynd with swete and bitternesse.
  The sore of love is merveilous;
  For now the lover [is] Ioyous,
  Now can he pleyne, now can he grone,
  Now can he singen, now maken mone.                2300
  To-day he pleyneth for hevinesse,
  To-morowe he pleyeth for Iolynesse.
  The lyf of love is ful contrarie,
  Which stoundemele can ofte varie.
  But if thou canst [som] mirthis make,             2305
  That men in gree wole gladly take,
  Do it goodly, I comaunde thee;
  For men sholde, wher-so-ever they be,
  Do thing that hem [best] sitting is,
  For therof cometh good loos and pris.             2310
  Wher-of that thou be vertuous,
  Ne be not straunge ne daungerous.
  For if that thou good rider be,
  Prike gladly, that men may se.
  In armes also if thou conne,                      2315
  Pursue, til thou a name hast wonne.
  And if thy voice be fair and clere,
  Thou shalt maken no gret daungere
  Whan to singe they goodly preye;
  It is thy worship for to obeye.                   2320
  Also to you it longith ay
  To harpe and giterne, daunce and play;
  For if he can wel foote and daunce,
  It may him greetly do avaunce.
  Among eek, for thy lady sake,                     2325
  Songes and complayntes that thou make;
  For that wol meve [hem] in hir herte,
  Whan they reden of thy smerte.
  Loke that no man for scarce thee holde,
  For that may greve thee manyfolde.                2330
  Resoun wol that a lover be
  In his yiftes more large and free
  Than cherles that been not of loving.
  For who ther-of can any thing,
  He shal be leef ay for to yeve,                   2335
  In [Loves] lore who so wolde leve;
  For he that, through a sodeyn sight,
  Or for a kissing, anon-right
  Yaf hool his herte in wille and thought,
  And to him-silf kepith right nought,              2340
  Aftir [swich yift], is good resoun,
  He yeve his good in abandoun.
   'Now wol I shortly here reherce,
  Of that [that] I have seid in verse,
  Al the sentence by and by,                        2345
  In wordis fewe compendiously,
  That thou the bet mayst on hem thinke,
  Whether-so it be thou wake or winke;
  For [that] the wordis litel greve
  A man to kepe, whanne it is breve.                2350
   'Who-so with Love wol goon or ryde
  He mot be curteys, and void of pryde,
  Mery and fulle of Iolite,
  And of largesse alosed be.
   'First I Ioyne thee, here in penaunce,           2355
  That ever, withoute repentaunce,
  Thou set thy thought in thy loving,
  To laste withoute repenting;
  And thenke upon thy mirthis swete,
  That shal folowe aftir whan ye mete.              2360
   'And for thou trewe to love shalt be,
  I wol, and [eek] comaunde thee,
  That in oo place thou sette, al hool,
  Thyn herte, withouten halfen dool,
  For trecherie, [in] sikernesse;                   2365
  For I lovede never doublenesse.
  To many his herte that wol depart,
  Everiche shal have but litel part.
  But of him drede I me right nought,
  That in oo place settith his thought.             2370
  Therfore in oo place it sette,
  And lat it never thennes flette.
  For if thou yevest it in lening,
  I holde it but a wrecchid thing:
  Therfore yeve it hool and quyte,                  2375
  And thou shalt have the more merite.
  If it be lent, than aftir soon,
  The bountee and the thank is doon;
  But, in love, free yeven thing
  Requyrith a gret guerdoning.                      2380
  Yeve it in yift al quit fully,
  And make thy yift debonairly;
  For men that yift [wol] holde more dere
  That yeven is with gladsome chere.
  That yift nought to preisen is                    2385
  That man yeveth, maugre his.
  Whan thou hast yeven thyn herte, as I
  Have seid thee here [al] openly,
  Than aventures shulle thee falle,
  Which harde and hevy been withalle.               2390
  For ofte whan thou bithenkist thee
  Of thy loving, wher-so thou be,
  Fro folk thou must depart in hy,
  That noon perceyve thy malady,
  But hyde thyn harm thou must alone,               2395
  And go forth sole, and make thy mone.
  Thou shalt no whyl be in oo stat,
  But whylom cold and whylom hat;
  Now reed as rose, now yelowe and fade.
  Such sorowe, I trowe, thou never hade;            2400
  Cotidien, ne [yit] quarteyne,
  It is nat so ful of peyne.
  For ofte tymes it shal falle
  In love, among thy peynes alle,
  That thou thy-self, al hoolly,                    2405
  Foryeten shalt so utterly,
  That many tymes thou shalt be
  Stille as an image of tree,
  Dom as a stoon, without stering
  Of foot or hond, without speking.                 2410
  Than, sone after al thy peyne,
  To memorie shalt thou come ageyn,
  As man abasshed wondre sore,
  And after sighen more and more.
  For wit thou wel, withouten wene,                 2415
  In swich astat ful oft have been
  That have the yvel of love assayd,
  Wher-through thou art so dismayd.
   'After, a thought shal take thee so,
  That thy love is to fer thee fro:                 2420
  Thou shalt say, "God, what may this be,
  That I ne may my lady see?
  Myne herte aloon is to her go,
  And I abyde al sole in wo,
  Departed fro myn owne thought,                    2425
  And with myne eyen see right nought.
   '"Alas, myn eyen sende I ne may,
  My careful herte to convay!
  Myn hertes gyde but they be,
  I praise no-thing what ever they see.             2430
  Shul they abyde thanne? nay;
  But goon visyte without delay
  That myn herte desyreth so.
  For certeynly, but-if they go,
  A fool my-self I may wel holde,                   2435
  Whan I ne see what myn herte wolde.
  Wherfore I wol gon her to seen,
  Or esed shal I never been,
  But I have som tokening."
  Then gost thou forth without dwelling;            2440
  But ofte thou faylest of thy desyre,
  Er thou mayst come hir any nere,
  And wastest in vayn thy passage.
  Than fallest thou in a newe rage;
  For want of sight thou ginnest morne,             2445
  And homward pensif dost retorne.
  In greet mischeef than shall thou be,
  For than agayn shal come to thee
  Sighes and pleyntes, with newe wo,
  That no icching prikketh so.                      2450
  Who wot it nought, he may go lere
  Of hem that byen love so dere.
   'No-thing thyn herte appesen may,
  That oft thou wolt goon and assay,
  If thou mayst seen, by aventure,                  2455
  Thy lyves joy, thyn hertis cure;
  So that, by grace if thou might
  Atteyne of hir to have a sight,
  Than shall thou doon non other dede
  But with that sight thyn eyen fede.               2460
  That faire fresh whan thou mayst see,
  Thyn herte shal so ravisshed be,
  That never thou woldest, thy thankis, lete,
  Ne remove, for to see that swete.
  The more thou seest in sothfastnesse,             2465
  The more thou coveytest of that swetnesse;
  The more thyn herte brenneth in fyr,
  The more thyn herte is in desyr.
  For who considreth every del,
  It may be lykned wondir wel,                      2470
  The peyne of love, unto a fere;
  For ever [the] more thou neighest nere
  Thought, or who-so that it be,
  For verray sothe I telle it thee,
  The hatter ever shal thou brenne,                 2475
  As experience shal thee kenne.
  Wher-so [thou] comest in any cost,
  Who is next fyr, he brenneth most.
  And yit forsothe, for al thyn hete,
  Though thou for love swelte and swete,            2480
  Ne for no-thing thou felen may,
  Thou shalt not willen to passe away.
  And though thou go, yet must thee nede
  Thenke al-day on hir fairhede,
  Whom thou bihelde with so good wille;             2485
  And holde thysilf bigyled ille,
  That thou ne haddest non hardement
  To shewe hir ought of thyn entent.
  Thyn herte ful sore thou wolt dispyse,
  And eek repreve of cowardyse,                     2490
  That thou, so dulle in every thing,
  Were dom for drede, without speking.
  Thou shalt eek thenke thou didest foly,
  That thou were hir so faste by,
  And durst not auntre thee to say                  2495
  Som-thing, er thou cam away;
  For thou haddist no more wonne,
  To speke of hir whan thou bigonne:
  But yif she wolde, for thy sake,
  In armes goodly thee have take,                   2500
  It shulde have be more worth to thee
  Than of tresour greet plentee.
   'Thus shalt thou morne and eek compleyn,
  And gete enchesoun to goon ageyn
  Unto thy walk, or to thy place,                   2505
  Where thou biheld hir fleshly face.
  And never, for fals suspeccioun,
  Thou woldest finde occasioun
  For to gon unto hir hous.
  So art thou thanne desirous                       2510
  A sight of hir for to have,
  If thou thine honour mightest save,
  Or any erand mightist make
  Thider, for thy loves sake;
  Ful fayn thou woldist, but for drede              2515
  Thou gost not, lest that men take hede.
  Wherfore I rede, in thy going,
  And also in thyn ageyn-coming,
  Thou be wel war that men ne wit;
  Feyne thee other cause than it                    2520
  To go that weye, or faste by;
  To hele wel is no folye.
  And if so be it happe thee
  That thou thy love ther mayst see,
  In siker wyse thou hir salewe,                    2525
  Wherwith thy colour wol transmewe,
  And eke thy blood shal al to-quake,
  Thyn hewe eek chaungen for hir sake.
  But word and wit, with chere ful pale,
  Shul wante for to telle thy tale.                 2530
  And if thou mayst so fer-forth winne,
  That thou [thy] resoun durst biginne,
  And woldist seyn three thingis or mo,
  Thou shalt ful scarsly seyn the two.
  Though thou bithenke thee never so wel,           2535
  Thou shalt foryete yit somdel,
  But-if thou dele with trecherye.
  For fals lovers mowe al folye
  Seyn, what hem lust, withouten drede,
  They be so double in hir falshede;                2540
  For they in herte cunne thenke a thing
  And seyn another, in hir speking.
  And whan thy speche is endid al,
  Right thus to thee it shal bifal;
  If any word than come to minde,                   2545
  That thou to seye hast left bihinde,
  Than thou shalt brenne in greet martyr;
  For thou shalt brenne as any fyr.
  This is the stryf and eke the affray,
  And the batail that lastith ay.                   2550
  This bargeyn ende may never take,
  But-if that she thy pees wil make.
   'And whan the night is comen, anon
  A thousand angres shal come upon.
  To bedde as fast thou wolt thee dight,            2555
  Where thou shalt have but smal delyt;
  For whan thou wenest for to slepe,
  So ful of peyne shalt thou crepe,
  Sterte in thy bedde aboute ful wyde,
  And turne ful ofte on every syde;                 2560
  Now dounward groffe, and now upright,
  And walowe in wo the longe night,
  Thyne armis shalt thou sprede a-brede,
  As man in werre were forwerreyd.
  Than shal thee come a remembraunce                2565
  Of hir shape and hir semblaunce,
  Wherto non other may be pere.
  And wite thou wel, withoute were,
  That thee shal [seme], somtyme that night,
  That thou hast hir, that is so bright,            2570
  Naked bitwene thyn armes there,
  Al sothfastnesse as though it were.
  Thou shalt make castels than in Spayne,
  And dreme of Ioye, al but in vayne,
  And thee delyten of right nought,                 2575
  Whyl thou so slomrest in that thought,
  That is so swete and delitable,
  The which, in soth, nis but a fable,
  For it ne shal no whyle laste.
  Than shalt thou sighe and wepe faste,             2580
  And say, "Dere god, what thing is this?
  My dreme is turned al amis,
  Which was ful swete and apparent,
  But now I wake, it is al shent!
  Now yede this mery thought away!                  2585
  Twenty tymes upon a day
  I wolde this thought wolde come ageyn,
  For it alleggith wel my peyn.
  It makith me ful of Ioyful thought,
  It sleeth me, that it lastith noght.              2590
  A, lord! why nil ye me socoure,
  The Ioye, I trowe, that I langoure?
  The deth I wolde me shulde slo
  Whyl I lye in hir armes two.
  Myn harm is hard, withouten wene,                 2595
  My greet unese ful ofte I mene.
  But wolde Love do so I might
  Have fully Ioye of hir so bright,
  My peyne were quit me richely.
  Allas, to greet a thing aske I!                   2600
  It is but foly, and wrong wening,
  To aske so outrageous a thing.
  And who-so askith folily,
  He moot be warned hastily;
  And I ne wot what I may say,                      2605
  I am so fer out of the way;
  For I wolde have ful gret lyking
  And ful gret Ioye of lasse thing.
  For wolde she, of hir gentilnesse,
  Withouten more, me onis kesse,                    2610
  It were to me a greet guerdoun,
  Relees of al my passioun.
  But it is hard to come therto;
  Al is but foly that I do,
  So high I have myn herte set,                     2615
  Where I may no comfort get.
  I noot wher I sey wel or nought;
  But this I wot wel in my thought,
  That it were bet of hir aloon,
  For to stinte my wo and moon,                     2620
  A loke on [me] y-cast goodly,
  [Than] for to have, al utterly,
  Of another al hool the pley.
  A! lord! wher I shal byde the day
  That ever she shal my lady be?                    2625
  He is ful cured that may hir see.
  A! god! whan shal the dawning spring?
  To ly thus is an angry thing;
  I have no Ioye thus here to ly
  Whan that my love is not me by.                   2630
  A man to lyen hath gret disese,
  Which may not slepe ne reste in ese.
  I wolde it dawed, and were now day,
  And that the night were went away;
  For were it day, I wolde upryse.                  2635
  A! slowe sonne, shew thyn enpryse!
  Speed thee to sprede thy bemis bright,
  And chace the derknesse of the night,
  To putte away the stoundes stronge,
  Which in me lasten al to longe."                  2640
   'The night shalt thou contene so,
  Withoute rest, in peyne and wo;
  If ever thou knewe of love distresse,
  Thou shalt mowe lerne in that siknesse.
  And thus enduring shalt thou ly,                  2645
  And ryse on morwe up erly
  Out of thy bedde, and harneys thee
  Er ever dawning thou mayst see.
  Al privily than shalt thou goon,
  What [weder] it be, thy-silf aloon,               2650
  For reyn, or hayl, for snow, for slete,
  Thider she dwellith that is so swete,
  The which may falle aslepe be,
  And thenkith but litel upon thee.
  Than shalt thou goon, ful foule aferd;            2655
  Loke if the gate be unsperd,
  And waite without in wo and peyn,
  Ful yvel a-cold in winde and reyn.
  Than shal thou go the dore bifore,
  If thou maist fynde any score,                    2660
  Or hole, or reft, what ever it were;
  Than shalt thou stoupe, and lay to ere,
  If they within a-slepe be;
  I mene, alle save thy lady free.
  Whom waking if thou mayst aspye,                  2665
  Go put thy-silf in Iupartye,
  To aske grace, and thee bimene,
  That she may wite, withouten wene,
  That thou [a]night no rest hast had,
  So sore for hir thou were bistad.                 2670
  Wommen wel ought pite to take
  Of hem that sorwen for hir sake.
  And loke, for love of that relyke,
  That thou thenke non other lyke,
  For [whom] thou hast so greet annoy,              2675
  Shal kisse thee er thou go away,
  And hold that in ful gret deyntee.
  And, for that no man shal thee see
  Bifore the hous, ne in the way,
  Loke thou be goon ageyn er day.                   2680
  Suche coming, and such going,
  Such hevinesse, and such walking,
  Makith lovers, withouten wene,
  Under hir clothes pale and lene,
  For Love leveth colour ne cleernesse;             2685
  Who loveth trewe hath no fatnesse.
  Thou shalt wel by thy-selfe see
  That thou must nedis assayed be.
  For men that shape hem other wey
  Falsly her ladies to bitray,                      2690
  It is no wonder though they be fat;
  With false othes hir loves they gat;
  For oft I see suche losengeours
  Fatter than abbatis or priours.
   'Yet with o thing I thee charge,                 2695
  That is to seye, that thou be large
  Unto the mayd that hir doth serve,
  So best hir thank thou shalt deserve.
  Yeve hir yiftes, and get hir grace,
  For so thou may [hir] thank purchace,             2700
  That she thee worthy holde and free,
  Thy lady, and alle that may thee see.
  Also hir servauntes worshipe ay,
  And plese as muche as thou may;
  Gret good through hem may come to thee,           2705
  Bicause with hir they been prive.
  They shal hir telle how they thee fand
  Curteis and wys, and wel doand,
  And she shal preyse [thee] wel the mare.
  Loke out of londe thou be not fare;               2710
  And if such cause thou have, that thee
  Bihoveth to gon out of contree,
  Leve hool thyn herte in hostage,
  Til thou ageyn make thy passage.
  Thenk long to see the swete thing                 2715
  That hath thyn herte in hir keping.
   'Now have I told thee, in what wyse
  A lover shal do me servyse.
  Do it than, if thou wolt have
  The mede that thou aftir crave.'                  2720
    Whan Love al this had boden me,
  I seide him:--'Sire, how may it be
  That lovers may in such manere
  Endure the peyne ye have seid here?
  I merveyle me wonder faste,                       2725
  How any man may live or laste
  In such peyne, and such brenning,
  In sorwe and thought, and such sighing,
  Ay unrelesed wo to make,
  Whether so it be they slepe or wake.              2730
  In such annoy continuely,
  As helpe me god, this merveile I,
  How man, but he were maad of stele,
  Might live a month, such peynes to fele.'
    The God of Love than seide me,                  2735
  Freend, by the feith I owe to thee,
  May no man have good, but he it by.
  A man loveth more tendirly
  The thing that he hath bought most dere.
  For wite thou wel, withouten were,                2740
  In thank that thing is taken more,
  For which a man hath suffred sore.
  Certis, no wo ne may atteyne
  Unto the sore of loves peyne.
  Non yvel therto ne may amounte,                   2745
  No more than a man [may] counte
  The dropes that of the water be.
  For drye as wel the grete see
  Thou mightist, as the harmes telle
  Of hem that with Love dwelle                      2750
  In servyse; for peyne hem sleeth,
  And that ech man wolde flee the deeth,
  And trowe they shulde never escape,
  Nere that hope couthe hem make
  Glad as man in prisoun set,                       2755
  And may not geten for to et
  But barly-breed, and watir pure,
  And lyeth in vermin and in ordure;
  With alle this, yit can he live,
  Good hope such comfort hath him yive,             2760
  Which maketh wene that he shal be
  Delivered and come to liberte;
  In fortune is [his] fulle trust.
  Though he lye in strawe or dust,
  In hope is al his susteyning.                     2765
  And so for lovers, in hir wening,
  Whiche Love hath shit in his prisoun;
  Good-Hope is hir salvacioun.
  Good-Hope, how sore that they smerte,
  Yeveth hem bothe wille and herte                  2770
  To profre hir body to martyre;
  For Hope so sore doth hem desyre
  To suffre ech harm that men devyse,
  For Ioye that aftir shal aryse.
    Hope, in desire [to] cacche victorie;           2775
  In Hope, of love is al the glorie,
  For Hope is al that love may yive;
  Nere Hope, ther shulde no lover live.
  Blessid be Hope, which with desyre
  Avaunceth lovers in such manere.                  2780
  Good-Hope is curteis for to plese,
  To kepe lovers from al disese.
  Hope kepith his lond, and wol abyde,
  For any peril that may betyde;
  For Hope to lovers, as most cheef,                2785
  Doth hem enduren al mischeef;
  Hope is her help, whan mister is.
  And I shal yeve thee eek, y-wis,
  Three other thingis, that greet solas
  Doth to hem that be in my las.                    2790
   'The firste good that may be founde,
  To hem that in my lace be bounde,
  Is Swete-Thought, for to recorde
  Thing wherwith thou canst accorde
  Best in thyn herte, wher she be;                  2795
  Thought in absence is good to thee.
  Whan any lover doth compleyne,
  And liveth in distresse and peyne,
  Than Swete-Thought shal come, as blyve,
  Awey his angre for to dryve.                      2800
  It makith lovers have remembraunce
  Of comfort, and of high plesaunce,
  That Hope hath hight him for to winne.
  For Thought anoon than shal biginne,
  As fer, god wot, as he can finde,                 2805
  To make a mirrour of his minde;
  For to biholde he wol not lette.
  Hir person he shal afore him sette,
  Hir laughing eyen, persaunt and clere,
  Hir shape, hir fourme, hir goodly chere,          2810
  Hir mouth that is so gracious,
  So swete, and eek so saverous;
  Of alle hir fetures he shal take heede,
  His eyen with alle hir limes fede.
   'Thus Swete-Thenking shal aswage                 2815
  The peyne of lovers, and hir rage.
  Thy Ioye shal double, withoute gesse,
  Whan thou thenkist on hir semlinesse,
  Or of hir laughing, or of hir chere,
  That to thee made thy lady dere.                  2820
  This comfort wol I that thou take;
  And if the next thou wolt forsake
  Which is not lesse saverous,
  Thou shuldist been to daungerous.
   'The secounde shal be Swete-Speche,              2825
  That hath to many oon be leche,
  To bringe hem out of wo and were,
  And helpe many a bachilere;
  And many a lady sent socoure,
  That have loved par-amour,                        2830
  Through speking, whan they mighten here
  Of hir lovers, to hem so dere.
  To [hem] it voidith al hir smerte,
  The which is closed in hir herte.
  In herte it makith hem glad and light,            2835
  Speche, whan they mowe have sight.
  And therfore now it cometh to minde,
  In olde dawes, as I finde,
  That clerkis writen that hir knewe
  Ther was a lady fresh of hewe,                    2840
  Which of hir love made a song
  On him for to remembre among,
  In which she seide, "Whan that I here
  Speken of him that is so dere,
  To me it voidith al [my] smerte,                  2845
  Y-wis, he sit so nere myn herte.
  To speke of him, at eve or morwe,
  It cureth me of al my sorwe.
  To me is noon so high plesaunce
  As of his persone daliaunce."                     2850
  She wist ful wel that Swete-Speking
  Comfortith in ful muche thing.
  Hir love she had ful wel assayed,
  Of him she was ful wel apayed;
  To speke of him hir Ioye was set.                 2855
  Therfore I rede thee that thou get
  A felowe that can wel concele
  And kepe thy counsel, and wel hele,
  To whom go shewe hoolly thyn herte,
  Bothe wele and wo, Ioye and smerte:               2860
  To gete comfort to him thou go,
  And privily, bitween yow two,
  Ye shal speke of that goodly thing,
  That hath thyn herte in hir keping;
  Of hir beaute and hir semblaunce,                 2865
  And of hir goodly countenaunce.
  Of al thy state thou shalt him sey,
  And aske him counseil how thou may
  Do any thing that may hir plese;
  For it to thee shal do gret ese,                  2870
  That he may wite thou trust him so,
  Bothe of thy wele and of thy wo.
  And if his herte to love be set,
  His companye is muche the bet,
  For resoun wol, he shewe to thee                  2875
  Al uttirly his privite;
  And what she is he loveth so,
  To thee pleynly he shal undo,
  Withoute drede of any shame,
  Bothe telle hir renoun and hir name.              2880
  Than shal he forther, ferre and nere,
  And namely to thy lady dere,
  In siker wyse; ye, every other
  Shal helpen as his owne brother,
  In trouthe withoute doublenesse,                  2885
  And kepen cloos in sikernesse.
  For it is noble thing, in fay,
  To have a man thou darst say
  Thy prive counsel every del;
  For that wol comfort thee right wel,              2890
  And thou shall holde thee wel apayed,
  Whan such a freend thou hast assayed.
   'The thridde good of greet comfort
  That yeveth to lovers most disport,
  Comith of sight and biholding,                    2895
  That clepid is Swete-Loking,
  The whiche may noon ese do,
  Whan thou art fer thy lady fro;
  Wherfore thou prese alwey to be
  In place, where thou mayst hir se.                2900
  For it is thing most amerous,
  Most delitable and saverous,
  For to aswage a mannes sorowe,
  To sene his lady by the morowe.
  For it is a ful noble thing                       2905
  Whan thyn eyen have meting
  With that relyke precious,
  Wherof they be so desirous.
  But al day after, soth it is,
  They have no drede to faren amis,                 2910
  They dreden neither wind ne reyn,
  Ne [yit] non other maner peyn.
  For whan thyn eyen were thus in blis,
  Yit of hir curtesye, y-wis,
  Aloon they can not have hir Ioye,                 2915
  But to the herte they [it] convoye;
  Part of hir blis to him [they] sende,
  Of al this harm to make an ende.
  The eye is a good messangere,
  Which can to the herte in such manere             2920
  Tidyngis sende, that [he] hath seen,
  To voide him of his peynes cleen.
  Wherof the herte reioyseth so
  That a gret party of his wo
  Is voided, and put awey to flight.                2925
  Right as the derknesse of the night
  Is chased with clerenesse of the mone,
  Right so is al his wo ful sone
  Devoided clene, whan that the sight
  Biholden may that fresshe wight                   2930
  That the herte desyreth so,
  That al his derknesse is ago;
  For than the herte is al at ese,
  Whan they seen that [that] may hem plese.
   'Now have I thee declared alout,                 2935
  Of that thou were in drede and dout;
  For I have told thee feithfully
  What thee may curen utterly,
  And alle lovers that wole be
  Feithful, and ful of stabilite.                   2940
  Good-Hope alwey kepe by thy syde,
  And Swete-Thought make eek abyde,
  Swete-Loking and Swete-Speche;
  Of alle thyn harmes they shal be leche.
  Of every thou shalt have greet plesaunce;         2945
  If thou canst byde in sufferaunce,
  And serve wel without feyntyse,
  Thou shalt be quit of thyn empryse,
  With more guerdoun, if that thou live;
  But al this tyme this I thee yive.'               2950
    The God of Love whan al the day
  Had taught me, as ye have herd say,
  And enfourmed compendiously,
  He vanished awey al sodeynly,
  And I alone lefte, al sole,                       2955
  So ful of compleynt and of dole,
  For I saw no man ther me by.
  My woundes me greved wondirly;
  Me for to curen no-thing I knew,
  Save the botoun bright of hew,                    2960
  Wheron was set hoolly my thought;
  Of other comfort knew I nought,
  But it were through the God of Love;
  I knew nat elles to my bihove
  That might me ese or comfort gete,                2965
  But-if he wolde him entermete.
    The roser was, withoute doute,
  Closed with an hegge withoute,
  As ye to-forn have herd me seyn;
  And fast I bisied, and wolde fayn                 2970
  Have passed the haye, if I might
  Have geten in by any slight
  Unto the botoun so fair to see.
  But ever I dradde blamed to be,
  If men wolde have suspeccioun                     2975
  That I wolde of entencioun
  Have stole the roses that ther were;
  Therfore to entre I was in fere.
  But at the last, as I bithought
  Whether I sholde passe or nought,                 2980
  I saw come with a gladde chere
  To me, a lusty bachelere,
  Of good stature, and of good hight,
  And Bialacoil forsothe he hight.
  Sone he was to Curtesy,                           2985
  And he me graunted ful gladly
  The passage of the outer hay,
  And seide:--'Sir, how that ye may
  Passe, if [it] your wille be,
  The fresshe roser for to see,                     2990
  And ye the swete savour fele.
  Your warrant may [I be] right wele;
  So thou thee kepe fro folye,
  Shal no man do thee vilanye.
  If I may helpe you in ought,                      2995
  I shal not feyne, dredeth nought;
  For I am bounde to your servyse,
  Fully devoide of feyntyse.'
  Than unto Bialacoil saide I,
 'I thank you, sir, ful hertely,                    3000
  And your biheest [I] take at gree,
  That ye so goodly prefer me;
  To you it cometh of greet fraunchyse,
  That ye me prefer your servyse.'
  Than aftir, ful deliverly,                        3005
  Through the breres anoon wente I,
  Wherof encombred was the hay.
  I was wel plesed, the soth to say,
  To see the botoun fair and swote,
  So fresshe spronge out of the rote.               3010
    And Bialacoil me served wel,
  Whan I so nygh me mighte fele
  Of the botoun the swete odour,
  And so lusty hewed of colour.
  But than a cherl (foule him bityde!)              3015
  Bisyde the roses gan him hyde,
  To kepe the roses of that roser,
  Of whom the name was Daunger.
  This cherl was hid there in the greves,
  Covered with grasse and with leves,               3020
  To spye and take whom that he fond
  Unto that roser putte an hond.
  He was not sole, for ther was mo;
  For with him were other two
  Of wikkid maners, and yvel fame.                  3025
  That oon was clepid, by his name,
  Wikked-Tonge, god yeve him sorwe!
  For neither at eve, ne at morwe,
  He can of no man [no] good speke;
  On many a Iust man doth he wreke.                 3030
  Ther was a womman eek, that hight
  Shame, that, who can reken right,
  Trespas was hir fadir name,
  Hir moder Resoun; and thus was Shame
  [On lyve] brought of these ilk two.               3035
  And yit had Trespas never ado
  With Resoun, ne never ley hir by,
  He was so hidous and ugly,
  I mene, this that Trespas hight;
  But Resoun conceyveth, of a sight,                3040
  Shame, of that I spak aforn.
  And whan that Shame was thus born,
  It was ordeyned, that Chastitee
  Shulde of the roser lady be,
  Which, of the botouns more and las,               3045
  With sondry folk assailed was,
  That she ne wiste what to do.
  For Venus hir assailith so,
  That night and day from hir she stal
  Botouns and roses over-al.                        3050
  To Resoun than prayeth Chastitee,
  Whom Venus flemed over the see,
  That she hir doughter wolde hir lene,
  To kepe the roser fresh and grene.
  Anoon Resoun to Chastitee                         3055
  Is fully assented that it be,
  And grauntid hir, at hir request,
  That Shame, bicause she is honest,
  Shal keper of the roser be.
  And thus to kepe it ther were three,              3060
  That noon shulde hardy be ne bold
  (Were he yong, or were he old)
  Ageyn hir wille awey to bere
  Botouns ne roses, that ther were.
  I had wel sped, had I not been                    3065
  Awayted with these three, and seen.
  For Bialacoil, that was so fair,
  So gracious and debonair,
  Quitte him to me ful curteisly,
  And, me to plese, bad that I                      3070
  Shuld drawe me to the botoun nere;
  Prese in, to touche the rosere
  Which bar the roses, he yaf me leve;
  This graunt ne might but litel greve.
  And for he saw it lyked me,                       3075
  Right nygh the botoun pullede he
  A leef al grene, and yaf me that,
  The which ful nygh the botoun sat;
  I made [me] of that leef ful queynt.
  And whan I felte I was aqueynt                    3080
  With Bialacoil, and so prive,
  I wende al at my wille had be.
  Than wex I hardy for to tel
  To Bialacoil how me bifel
  Of Love, that took and wounded me,                3085
  And seide: 'Sir, so mote I thee,
  I may no loye have in no wyse,
  Upon no syde, but it ryse;
  For sithe (if I shal not feyne)
  In herte I have had so gret peyne,                3090
  So gret annoy, and such affray,
  That I ne wot what I shal say;
  I drede your wrath to disserve.
  Lever me were, that knyves kerve
  My body shulde in pecis smalle,                   3095
  Than in any wyse it shulde falle
  That ye wratthed shulde been with me.'
  Sey boldely thy wille,' quod he,
  I nil be wroth, if that I may,
  For nought that thou shalt to me say.'            3100
    Thanne seide I, 'Sir, not you displese
  To knowen of my greet unese,
  In which only love hath me brought;
  For peynes greet, disese and thought,
  Fro day to day he doth me drye;                   3105
  Supposeth not, sir, that I lye.
  In me fyve woundes dide he make,
  The sore of whiche shal never slake
  But ye the botoun graunte me,
  Which is most passaunt of beautee,                3110
  My lyf, my deth, and my martyre,
  And tresour that I most desyre.'
    Than Bialacoil, affrayed all,
  Seyde, 'Sir, it may not fall;
  That ye desire, it may not ryse.                  3115
  What? wolde ye shende me in this wyse?
  A mochel foole than I were,
  If I suffrid you awey to bere
  The fresh botoun, so fair of sight.
  For it were neither skile ne right                3120
  Of the roser ye broke the rind,
  Or take the rose aforn his kind;
  Ye ar not courteys to aske it.
  Lat it stil on the roser sit,
  And growe til it amended be,                      3125
  And parfitly come to beaute.
  I nolde not that it pulled wer
  Fro the roser that it ber,
  To me it is so leef and dere.'
    With that sterte out anoon Daungere,            3130
  Out of the place where he was hid.
  His malice in his chere was kid;
  Ful greet he was, and blak of hewe,
  Sturdy and hidous, who-so him knewe;
  Like sharp urchouns his here was growe,           3135
  His eyes rede as the fire-glow;
  His nose frounced ful kirked stood,
  He com criand as he were wood,
  And seide, 'Bialacoil, tel me why
  Thou bringest hider so boldly                     3140
  Him that so nygh [is] the roser?
  Thou worchist in a wrong maner;
  He thenkith to dishonour thee,
  Thou art wel worthy to have maugree
  To late him of the roser wit;                     3145
  Who serveth a feloun is yvel quit.
  Thou woldist have doon greet bountee,
  And he with shame wolde quyte thee.
  Flee hennes, felowe! I rede thee go!
  It wanteth litel I wol thee slo;                  3150
  For Bialacoil ne knew thee nought,
  Whan thee to serve he sette his thought;
  For thou wolt shame him, if thou might,
  Bothe ageyn resoun and right.
  I wol no more in thee affye,                      3155
  That comest so slyghly for tespye;
  For it preveth wonder wel,
  Thy slight and tresoun every del.'
    I durst no more ther make abode,
  For the cherl, he was so wode;                    3160
  So gan he threten and manace,
  And thurgh the haye he did me chace.
  For feer of him I tremblid and quook,
  So cherlishly his heed he shook;
  And seide, if eft he might me take,               3165
  I shulde not from his hondis scape.
    Than Bialacoil is fled and mate,
  And I al sole, disconsolate,
  Was left aloon in peyne and thought;
  For shame, to deth I was nygh brought.            3170
  Than thought I on myn high foly,
  How that my body, utterly,
  Was yeve to peyne and to martyre;
  And therto hadde I so gret yre,
  That I ne durst the hayes passe;                  3175
  There was non hope, there was no grace.
  I trowe never man wiste of peyne,
  But he were laced in Loves cheyne;
  Ne no man [wot], and sooth it is,
  But-if he love, what anger is.                    3180
  Love holdith his heest to me right wele,
  Whan peyne he seide I shulde fele.
  Non herte may thenke, ne tunge seyne,
  A quarter of my wo and peyne.
  I might not with the anger laste;                 3185
  Myn herte in poynt was for to braste,
  Whan I thought on the rose, that so
  Was through Daunger cast me froo.
    A long whyl stood I in that state,
  Til that me saugh so mad and mate                 3190
  The lady of the highe ward,
  Which from hir tour lokid thiderward.
  Resoun men clepe that lady,
  Which from hir tour deliverly
  Come doun to me withouten more.                   3195
  But she was neither yong, ne hore,
  Ne high ne low, ne fat ne lene,
  But best, as it were in a mene.
  Hir eyen two were cleer and light
  As any candel that brenneth bright;               3200
  And on hir heed she hadde a crown.
  Hir semede wel an high persoun;
  For rounde enviroun, hir crownet
  Was ful of riche stonis fret.
  Hir goodly semblaunt, by devys,                   3205
  I trowe were maad in paradys;
  Nature had never such a grace,
  To forge a werk of such compace.
  For certeyn, but the letter lye,
  God him-silf, that is so high,                    3210
  Made hir aftir his image,
  And yaf hir sith sich avauntage,
  That she hath might and seignorye
  To kepe men from al folye;
  Who-so wole trowe hir lore,                       3215
  Ne may offenden nevermore.
    And whyl I stood thus derk and pale,
  Resoun bigan to me hir tale;
  She seide: 'Al hayl, my swete frend!
  Foly and childhood wol thee shend,                3220
  Which thee have put in greet affray;
  Thou hast bought dere the tyme of May,
  That made thyn herte mery to be.
  In yvel tyme thou wentist to see
  The gardin, wherof Ydilnesse                      3225
  Bar the keye, and was maistresse
  Whan thou yedest in the daunce
  With hir, and haddest aqueyntaunce:
  Hir aqueyntaunce is perilous,
  First softe, and aftir[ward] noyous;              3230
  She hath [thee] trasshed, withoute ween;
  The God of Love had thee not seen,
  Ne hadde Ydilnesse thee conveyed
  In the verger where Mirthe him pleyed.
  If Foly have supprised thee,                      3235
  Do so that it recovered be;
  And be wel war to take no more
  Counsel, that greveth aftir sore;
  He is wys that wol himsilf chastyse.
  And though a young man in any wyse                3240
  Trespace among, and do foly,
  Lat him not tarye, but hastily
  Lat him amende what so be mis.
  And eek I counseile thee, y-wis,
  The God of Love hoolly foryet,                    3245
  That hath thee in sich peyne set,
  And thee in herte tormented so.
  I can nat seen how thou mayst go
  Other weyes to garisoun;
  For Daunger, that is so feloun,                   3250
  Felly purposith thee to werrey,
  Which is ful cruel, the soth to sey.
   'And yit of Daunger cometh no blame,
  In reward of my doughter Shame,
  Which hath the roses in hir warde,                3255
  As she that may be no musarde.
  And Wikked-Tunge is with these two,
  That suffrith no man thider go;
  For er a thing be do, he shal,
  Where that he cometh, over-al,                    3260
  In fourty places, if it be sought,
  Seye thing that never was doon ne wrought;
  So moche tresoun is in his male,
  Of falsnesse for to [feyne] a tale.
  Thou delest with angry folk, y-wis;               3265
  Wherfor to thee [it] bettir is
  From these folk awey to fare,
  For they wol make thee live in care.
  This is the yvel that Love they calle,
  Wherin ther is but foly alle,                     3270
  For love is foly everydel;
  Who loveth, in no wyse may do wel,
  Ne sette his thought on no good werk.
  His scole he lesith, if he be clerk;
  Of other craft eek if he be,                      3275
  He shal not thryve therin; for he
  In love shal have more passioun
  Than monke, hermyte, or chanoun.
  The peyne is hard, out of mesure,
  The Ioye may eek no whyl endure;                  3280
  And in the possessioun
  Is muche tribulacioun;
  The Ioye it is so short-lasting,
  And but in happe is the geting;
  For I see ther many in travaille,                 3285
  That atte laste foule fayle.
  I was no-thing thy counseler,
  Whan thou were maad the homager
  Of God of Love to hastily;
  Ther was no wisdom, but foly.                     3290
  Thyn herte was Ioly, but not sage,
  Whan thou were brought in sich a rage,
  To yelde thee so redily,
  And to Love, of his gret maistry.
   'I rede thee Love awey to dryve,                 3295
  That makith thee recche not of thy lyve.
  The foly more fro day to day
  Shal growe, but thou it putte away.
  Take with thy teeth the bridel faste,
  To daunte thyn herte; and eek thee caste,         3300
  If that thou mayst, to gete defence
  For to redresse thy first offence.
  Who-so his herte alwey wol leve,
  Shal finde among that shal him greve'
    Whan I hir herd thus me chastyse,               3305
  I answerd in ful angry wyse.
  I prayed hir cessen of hir speche,
  Outher to chastyse me or teche,
  To bidde me my thought refreyne,
  Which Love hath caught in his demeyne:--          3310
  What? wene ye Love wol consent,
  That me assailith with bowe bent,
  To draw myn herte out of his honde,
  Which is so quikly in his bonde?
  That ye counsayle, may never be;                  3315
  For whan he first arested me,
  He took myn herte so hool him til,
  That it is no-thing at my wil;
  He [taughte] it so him for to obey,
  That he it sparred with a key.                    3320
  I pray yow lat me be al stille.
  For ye may wel, if that ye wille,
  Your wordis waste in idilnesse;
  For utterly, withouten gesse,
  Al that ye seyn is but in veyne.                  3325
  Me were lever dye in the peyne,
  Than Love to me-ward shulde arette
  Falsheed, or tresoun on me sette.
  I wol me gete prys or blame,
  And love trewe, to save my name;                  3330
  Who me chastysith, I him hate.'
    With that word Resoun wente hir gate,
  Whan she saugh for no sermoning
  She might me fro my foly bring.
  Than dismayed, I lefte al sool,                   3335
  Forwery, forwandred as a fool,
  For I ne knew no chevisaunce.
  Than fel into my remembraunce,
  How Love bade me to purveye
  A felowe, to whom I mighte seye                   3340
  My counsel and my privete,
  For that shulde muche availe me.
  With that bithought I me, that I
  Hadde a felowe faste by,
  Trewe and siker, curteys, and hend,               3345
  And he was called by name a Freend;
  A trewer felowe was no-wher noon.
  In haste to him I wente anoon,
  And to him al my wo I tolde,
  Fro him right nought I wold withholde.            3350
  I tolde him al withoute were,
  And made my compleynt on Daungere,
  How for to see he was hidous,
  And to-me-ward contrarious;
  The whiche through his cruelte                    3355
  Was in poynt to have meygned me;
  With Bialacoil whan he me sey
  Within the gardyn walke and pley,
  Fro me he made him for to go,
  And I bilefte aloon in wo;                        3360
  I durst no lenger with him speke,
  For Daunger seide he wolde be wreke,
  Whan that he sawe how I wente
  The fresshe botoun for to hente,
  If I were hardy to come neer                      3365
  Bitwene the hay and the roser.
    This Freend, whan he wiste of my thought,
  He discomforted me right nought,
  But seide, 'Felowe, be not so mad,
  Ne so abaysshed nor bistad.                       3370
  My-silf I knowe ful wel Daungere,
  And how he is feers of his chere,
  At prime temps, Love to manace;
  Ful ofte I have ben in his caas.
  A feloun first though that he be,                 3375
  Aftir thou shalt him souple see.
  Of long passed I knew him wele;
  Ungoodly first though men him fele,
  He wol meek aftir, in his bering,
  Been, for service and obeysshing.                 3380
  I shal thee telle what thou shalt do.--
  Mekely I rede thou go him to,
  Of herte pray him specialy
  Of thy trespace to have mercy,
  And hote him wel, [him] here to plese,            3385
  That thou shalt nevermore him displese.
  Who can best serve of flatery,
  Shal plese Daunger most uttirly.'
    My Freend hath seid to me so wel,
  That he me esid hath somdel,                      3390
  And eek allegged of my torment;
  For through him had I hardement
  Agayn to Daunger for to go,
  To preve if I might meke him so.
    To Daunger cam I, al ashamed,                   3395
  The which aforn me hadde blamed,
  Desyring for to pese my wo;
  But over hegge durst I not go,
  For he forbad me the passage.
  I fond him cruel in his rage,                     3400
  And in his hond a gret burdoun.
  To him I knelid lowe adoun,
  Ful meke of port, and simple of chere,
  And seide, 'Sir, I am comen here
  Only to aske of you mercy.                        3405
  That greveth me, [sir], ful gretly
  That ever my lyf I wratthed you,
  But for to amende I am come now,
  With al my might, bothe loude and stille,
  To doon right at your owne wille;                 3410
  For Love made me for to do
  That I have trespassed hidirto;
  Fro whom I ne may withdrawe myn herte;
  Yit shal I never, for Ioy ne smerte,
  What so bifalle, good or ille,                    3415
  Offende more ageyn your wille.
  Lever I have endure disese
  Than do that shulde you displese.
   'I you require and pray, that ye
  Of me have mercy and pitee,                       3420
  To stinte your yre that greveth so,
  That I wol swere for evermo
  To be redressid at your lyking,
  If I trespasse in any thing;
  Save that I pray thee graunte me                  3425
  A thing that may nat warned be,
  That I may love, al only;
  Non other thing of you aske I.
  I shal doon elles wel, y-wis,
  If of your grace ye graunte me this.              3430
  And ye [ne] may not letten me,
  For wel wot ye that love is free,
  And I shal loven, [sith] that I wil,
  Who-ever lyke it wel or il;
  And yit ne wold I, for al Fraunce,                3435
  Do thing to do you displesaunce.'
    Than Daunger fil in his entent
  For to foryeve his maltalent;
  But al his wratthe yit at laste
  He hath relesed, I preyde so faste:               3440
  Shortly he seide, 'Thy request
  Is not to mochel dishonest;
  Ne I wol not werne it thee,
  For yit no-thing engreveth me.
  For though thou love thus evermore,               3445
  To me is neither softe ne sore.
  Love wher thee list; what recchith me,
  So [thou] fer fro my roses be?
  Trust not on me, for noon assay,
  In any tyme to passe the hay.'                    3450
  Thus hath he graunted my prayere.
    Than wente I forth, withouten were,
  Unto my Freend, and tolde him al,
  Which was right Ioyful of my tale.
  He seide, 'Now goth wel thyn affaire,             3455
  He shal to thee be debonaire.
  Though he aforn was dispitous,
  He shal heeraftir be gracious.
  If he were touchid on som good veyne,
  He shuld yit rewen on thy peyne.                  3460
  Suffire, I rede, and no boost make,
  Til thou at good mes mayst him take.
  By suffraunce, and [by] wordis softe,
  A man may overcomen ofte
  Him that aforn he hadde in drede,                 3465
  In bookis sothly as I rede.'
    Thus hath my Freend with gret comfort
  Avaunced me with high disport,
  Which wolde me good as mich as I.
  And thanne anoon ful sodeynly                     3470
  I took my leve, and streight I went
  Unto the hay; for gret talent
  I had to seen the fresh botoun,
  Wherin lay my salvacioun;
  And Daunger took kepe, if that I                  3475
  Kepe him covenaunt trewly.
  So sore I dradde his manasing,
  I durst not breke[n] his bidding;
  For, lest that I were of him shent,
  I brak not his comaundement,                      3480
  For to purchase his good wil.
  It was [hard] for to come ther-til,
  His mercy was to fer bihinde;
  I wepte, for I ne might it finde.
  I compleyned and sighed sore,                     3485
  And languisshed evermore,
  For I durst not over go
  Unto the rose I loved so.
  Thurghout my deming outerly,
  [Than] had he knowlege certeinly,                 3490
  [That] Love me ladde in sich a wyse,
  That in me ther was no feyntyse,
  Falsheed, ne no trecherye.
  And yit he, ful of vilanye,
  Of disdeyne, and cruelte,                         3495
  On me ne wolde have pite,
  His cruel wil for to refreyne,
  Though I wepe alwey, and compleyne.
    And while I was in this torment,
  Were come of grace, by god sent,                  3500
  Fraunchyse, and with hir Pite
  Fulfild the botoun of bountee.
  They go to Daunger anon-right
  To forther me with al hir might,
  And helpe in worde and in dede,                   3505
  For wel they saugh that it was nede.
  First, of hir grace, dame Fraunchyse
  Hath taken [word] of this empryse:
  She seide, 'Daunger, gret wrong ye do
  To worche this man so muche wo,                   3510
  Or pynen him so angerly;
  It is to you gret vilany.
  I can not see why, ne how,
  That he hath trespassed ageyn you,
  Save that he loveth; wherfore ye shulde           3515
  The more in cherete of him holde.
  The force of love makith him do this;
  Who wolde him blame he dide amis?
  He leseth more than ye may do;
  His peyne is hard, ye may see, lo!                3520
  And Love in no wyse wolde consente
  That [he] have power to repente;
  For though that quik ye wolde him sloo,
  Fro Love his herte may not go.
  Now, swete sir, is it your ese                    3525
  Him for to angre or disese?
  Allas, what may it you avaunce
  To doon to him so greet grevaunce?
  What worship is it agayn him take,
  Or on your man a werre make,                      3530
  Sith he so lowly every wyse
  Is redy, as ye lust devyse?
  If Love hath caught him in his lace,
  You for tobeye in every caas,
  And been your suget at your wille,                3535
  Shulde ye therfore willen him ille?
  Ye shulde him spare more, al-out,
  Than him that is bothe proud and stout.
  Curtesye wol that ye socour
  Hem that ben meke undir your cure.                3540
  His herte is hard, that wole not meke,
  Whan men of mekenesse him biseke.'
   'That is certeyn,' seide Pite;
  We see ofte that humilitee
  Bothe ire, and also felonye                       3545
  Venquissheth, and also melancolye;
  To stonde forth in such duresse,
  This crueltee and wikkednesse.
  Wherfore I pray you, sir Daungere,
  For to mayntene  no lenger here                   3550
  Such cruel werre agayn your man,
  As hoolly youres as ever he can;
  Nor that ye worchen no more wo
  On this caytif that languisshith so,
  Which wol no more to you trespasse,               3555
  But put him hoolly in your grace.
  His offense ne was but lyte;
  The God of Love it was to wyte,
  That he your thral so gretly is,
  And if ye harm him, ye doon amis;                 3560
  For he hath had ful hard penaunce,
  Sith that ye refte him thaqueyntaunce
  Of Bialacoil, his moste Ioye,
  Which alle his peynes might acoye.
  He was biforn anoyed sore,                        3565
  But than ye doubled him wel more;
  For he of blis hath ben ful bare,
  Sith Bialacoil was fro him fare.
  Love hath to him do greet distresse,
  He hath no nede of more duresse.                  3570
  Voideth from him your ire, I rede;
  Ye may not winnen in this dede.
  Makith Bialacoil repeire ageyn,
  And haveth pite upon his peyn;
  For Fraunchise wol, and I, Pite,                  3575
  That merciful to him ye be;
  And sith that she and I accorde,
  Have upon him misericorde;
  For I you pray, and eek moneste,
  Nought to refusen our requeste;                   3580
  For he is hard and fel of thought,
  That for us two wol do right nought.'
    Daunger ne might no more endure,
  He meked him unto mesure.
   'I wol in no wyse,' seith Daungere,              3585
  Denye that ye have asked here;
  It were to greet uncurtesye.
  I wol ye have the companye
  Of Bialacoil, as ye devyse;
  I wol him letten in no wyse.'                     3590
    To Bialacoil than wente in hy
  Fraunchyse, and seide ful curteisly:--
  Ye have to longe be deignous
  Unto this lover, and daungerous,
  Fro him to withdrawe your presence,               3595
  Which hath do to him grete offence,
  That ye not wolde upon him see;
  Wherfore a sorowful man is he.
  Shape ye to paye him, and to plese,
  Of my love if ye wol have ese.                    3600
  Fulfil his wil, sith that ye knowe
  Daunger is daunted and brought lowe
  Thurgh help of me and of Pite;
  You [thar] no more afered be.'
   'I shal do right as ye wil,'                     3605
  Saith Bialacoil, 'for it is skil,
  Sith Daunger wol that it so be.'
  Than Fraunchise hath him sent to me.
    Bialacoil at the biginning
  Salued me in his coming.                          3610
  No straungenes was in him seen,
  No more than he ne had wrathed been.
  As faire semblaunt than shewed he me,
  And goodly, as aforn did he;
  And by the honde, withouten doute,                3615
  Within the haye, right al aboute
  He ladde me, with right good chere,
  Al environ the vergere,
  That Daunger had me chased fro.
  Now have I leve over-al to go;                    3620
  Now am I raised, at my devys,
  Fro helle unto paradys.
  Thus Bialacoil, of gentilnesse,
  With alle his peyne and besinesse,
  Hath shewed me, only of grace,                    3625
  The estres of the swote place.
    I saw the rose, whan I was nigh,
  Was gretter woxen, and more high,
  Fresh, rody, and fair of hewe,
  Of colour ever yliche newe.                       3630
  And whan I had it longe seen,
  I saugh that through the leves grene
  The rose spredde to spanishing;
  To sene it was a goodly thing.
  But it ne was so spred on brede,                  3635
  That men within might knowe the sede;
  For it covert was and [en]close
  Bothe with the leves and with the rose.
  The stalk was even and grene upright,
  It was theron a goodly sight;                     3640
  And wel the better, withouten wene,
  For the seed was not [y]-sene.
  Ful faire it spradde, [god it] blesse!
  For suche another, as I gesse,
  Aforn ne was, ne more vermayle.                   3645
  I was abawed for merveyle,
  For ever, the fairer that it was,
  The more I am bounden in Loves laas.
    Longe I abood there, soth to saye,
  Til Bialacoil I gan to praye,                     3650
  Whan that I saw him in no wyse
  To me warnen his servyse,
  That he me wolde graunte a thing,
  Which to remembre is wel sitting;
  This is to sayne, that of his grace               3655
  He wolde me yeve leyser and space
  To me that was so desirous
  To have a kissing precious
  Of the goodly freshe rose,
  That swetely smelleth in my nose;                 3660
  For if it you displesed nought,
  I wolde gladly, as I have sought,
  Have a cos therof freely
  Of your yeft; for certainly
  I wol non have but by your leve,                  3665
  So loth me were you for to greve.'
    He sayde, 'Frend, so god me spede,
  Of Chastite I have suche drede,
  Thou shuldest not warned be for me,
  But I dar not, for Chastite.                      3670
  Agayn hir dar I not misdo,
  For alwey biddeth she me so
  To yeve no lover leve to kisse;
  For who therto may winnen, y-wis,
  He of the surplus of the pray                     3675
  May live in hope to get som day.
  For who so kissing may attayne,
  Of loves peyne hath, soth to sayne,
  The beste and most avenaunt,
  And ernest of the remenaunt.'                     3680
    Of his answere I syghed sore;
  I durst assaye him tho no more,
  I had such drede to greve him ay.
  A man shulde not to muche assaye
  To chafe his frend out of mesure,                 3685
  Nor put his lyf in aventure;
  For no man at the firste stroke
  Ne may nat felle doun an oke;
  Nor of the reisins have the wyne,
  Til grapes rype and wel afyne                     3690
  Be sore empressid, I you ensure,
  And drawen out of the pressure.
  But I, forpeyned wonder stronge,
  [Thought] that I abood right longe
  Aftir the kis, in peyne and wo,                   3695
  Sith I to kis desyred so:
  Til that, [rewing] on my distresse,
  Ther [to me] Venus the goddesse,
  Which ay werreyeth Chastite,
  Came of hir grace, to socoure me,                 3700
  Whos might is knowe fer and wyde,
  For she is modir of Cupyde,
  The God of Love, blinde as stoon,
  That helpith lovers many oon.
  This lady brought in hir right hond               3705
  Of brenning fyr a blasing brond;
  Wherof the flawme and hote fyr
  Hath many a lady in desyr
  Of love brought, and sore het,
  And in hir servise hir hertes set.                3710
  This lady was of good entayle,
  Right wondirful of apparayle;
  By hir atyre so bright and shene,
  Men might perceyve wel, and seen,
  She was not of religioun.                         3715
  Nor I nil make mencioun
  Nor of [hir] robe, nor of tresour,
  Of broche, [nor] of hir riche attour;
  Ne of hir girdil aboute hir syde,
  For that I nil not long abyde.                    3720
  But knowith wel, that certeynly
  She was arayed richely.
  Devoyd of pryde certeyn she was;
  To Bialacoil she wente a pas,
  And  to  him shortly, in a clause,                3725
  She seide: 'Sir, what is the cause
  Ye been of port so daungerous
  Unto this lover, and deynous,
  To graunte him no-thing but a kis?
  To werne it him ye doon amis;                     3730
  Sith wel ye wote, how that he
  Is Loves servaunt, as ye may see,
  And hath beaute, wher-through [he] is
  Worthy of love to have the blis.
  How he is semely, biholde and see,                3735
  How he is fair, how he is free,
  How he is swote and debonair,
  Of age yong, lusty, and fair.
  Ther is no lady so hauteyne,
  Duchesse, countesse, ne chasteleyne,              3740
  That I nolde holde hir ungoodly
  For to refuse him outerly.
  His breeth is also good and swete,
  And eke his lippis rody, and mete
  Only to pleyen, and to kisse.                     3745
  Graunte him a kis, of gentilnesse!
  His teeth arn also whyte and clene;
  Me thinkith wrong, withouten wene,
  If ye now werne him, trustith me,
  To graunte that a kis have he;                    3750
  The lasse [to] helpe him that ye haste,
  The more tyme shul ye waste.'
    Whan the flawme of the verry brond,
  That Venus brought in hir right hond,
  Had Bialacoil with hete smete,                    3755
  Anoon he bad, withouten lette,
  Graunte to me the rose kisse.
  Than of my peyne I gan to lisse,
  And to the rose anoon wente I,
  And kissid it ful feithfully.                     3760
  Thar no man aske if I was blythe,
  Whan the savour soft and lythe
  Strook to myn herte withoute more,
  And me alegged of my sore,
  So was I ful of Ioye and blisse.                  3765
  It is fair sich a flour to kisse,
  It was so swote and saverous.
  I might not be so anguisshous,
  That I mote glad and Ioly be,
  Whan that I remembre me.                          3770
  Yit ever among, sothly to seyn,
  I suffre noye and moche peyn.
    The see may never be so stil,
  That with a litel winde it [nil]
  Overwhelme and turne also,                        3775
  As it were wood, in wawis go.
  Aftir the calm the trouble sone
  Mot folowe, and chaunge as the mone.
  Right so farith Love, that selde in oon
  Holdith his anker; for right anoon                3780
  Whan they in ese wene best to live,
  They been with tempest al fordrive.
  Who serveth Love, can telle of wo;
  The stoundemele Ioye mot overgo.
  Now he hurteth, and now he cureth,                3785
  For selde in oo poynt Love endureth.
    Now is it right me to procede,
  How Shame gan medle and take hede,
  Thurgh whom felle angres I have had;
  And how the stronge wal was maad,                 3790
  And the castell of brede and lengthe,
  That God of Love wan with his strengthe.
  Al this in romance wil I sette,
  And for no-thing ne wil I lette,
  So that it lyking to hir be,                      3795
  That is the flour of beaute;
  For she may best my labour quyte,
  That I for hir love shal endyte.
    Wikkid-Tunge, that the covyne
  Of every lover can devyne                         3800
  Worst, and addith more somdel,
  (For Wikkid-Tunge seith never wel),
  To me-ward bar he right gret hate,
  Espying me erly and late,
  Til he hath seen the grete chere                  3805
  Of Bialacoil and me y-fere.
  He mighte not his tunge withstonde
  Worse to reporte than he fonde,
  He was so ful of cursed rage;
  It sat him wel of his linage,                     3810
  For him an Irish womman bar.
  His tunge was fyled sharp, and squar,
  Poignaunt and right kerving,
  And wonder bitter in speking.
  For whan that he me gan espye,                    3815
  He swoor, afferming sikirly,
  Bitwene Bialacoil and me
  Was yvel aquayntaunce and privee.
  He spak therof so folily,
  That he awakid Ielousy;                           3820
  Which, al afrayed in his rysing,
  Whan that he herde [him] Iangling,
  He ran anoon, as he were wood,
  To Bialacoil ther that he stood;
  Which hadde lever in this caas                    3825
  Have been at Reynes or Amyas;
  For foot-hoot, in his felonye
  To him thus seide Ielousye:--
  Why hast thou been so necligent,
  To kepen, whan I was absent,                      3830
  This verger here left in thy ward?
  To me thou haddist no reward,
  To truste (to thy confusioun)
  Him thus, to whom suspeccioun
  I have right greet, for it is nede;               3835
  It is wel shewed by the dede.
  Greet faute in thee now have I founde;
  By god, anoon thou shalt be bounde,
  And faste loken in a tour,
  Withoute refuyt or socour.                        3840
  For Shame to long hath be thee fro;
  Over sone she was agoo.
  Whan thou hast lost bothe drede and fere,
  It semed wel she was not here.
  She was [not] bisy, in no wyse,                   3845
  To kepe thee and [to] chastyse,
  And for to helpen Chastitee
  To kepe the roser, as thinkith me.
  For than this boy-knave so boldely
  Ne sholde not have be hardy,                      3850
  [Ne] in this verger had such game,
  Which now me turneth to gret shame.'
    Bialacoil nist what to sey;
  Ful fayn he wolde have fled awey,
  For fere han hid, nere that he                    3855
  Al sodeynly took him with me.
  And whan I saugh he hadde so,
  This Ielousye, take us two,
  I was astoned, and knew no rede,
  But fledde awey for verrey drede.                 3860
    Than Shame cam forth ful simply;
  She wende have trespaced ful gretly;
  Humble of hir port, and made it simple,
  Wering a vayle in stede of wimple,
  As nonnis doon in hir abbey.                      3865
  Bicause hir herte was in affray,
  She gan to speke, within a throwe,
  To Ielousye, right wonder lowe.
  First of his grace she bisought,
  And seide:--'Sire, ne leveth nought               3870
  Wikkid-Tunge, that fals espye,
  Which is so glad to feyne and lye.
  He hath you maad, thurgh flatering,
  On Bialacoil a fals lesing.
  His falsnesse is not now anew,                    3875
  It is to long that he him knew.
  This is not the firste day;
  For Wikkid-Tunge hath custom ay
  Yonge folkis to bewreye,
  And false lesinges on hem leye.                   3880
   'Yit nevertheles I see among,
  That the loigne it is so longe
  Of Bialacoil, hertis to lure,
  In Loves servise for to endure,
  Drawing suche folk him to,                        3885
  That he had no-thing with to do;
  But in sothnesse I trowe nought,
  That Bialacoil hadde ever in thought
  To do trespace or vilanye;
  But, for his modir Curtesye                       3890
  Hath taught him ever [for] to be
  Good of aqueyntaunce and privee;
  For he loveth non hevinesse,
  But mirthe and pley, and al gladnesse;
  He hateth alle [trecherous],                      3895
  Soleyn folk and envious;
  For [wel] ye witen how that he
  Wol ever glad and Ioyful be
  Honestly with folk to pley.
  I have be negligent, in good fey,                 3900
  To chastise him; therfore now I
  Of herte crye you here mercy,
  That I have been so recheles
  To tamen him, withouten lees.
  Of my foly I me repente;                          3905
  Now wol I hool sette myn entente
  To kepe, bothe [loude] and stille,
  Bialacoil to do your wille.'
   'Shame, Shame,' seyde Ielousy,
 'To be bitrasshed gret drede have I.               3910
  Lecherye hath clombe so hye,
  That almost blered is myn ye;
  No wonder is, if that drede have I.
  Over-al regnith Lechery,
  Whos might [yit] growith night and day.           3915
  Bothe in cloistre and in abbey
  Chastite is werreyed over-al.
  Therfore I wol with siker wal
  Close bothe roses and roser.
  I have to longe in this maner                     3920
  Left hem unclosid wilfully;
  Wherfore I am right inwardly
  Sorowful and repente me.
  But now they shal no lenger be
  Unclosid; and yit I drede sore,                   3925
  I shal repente ferthermore,
  For the game goth al amis.
  Counsel I [mot take] newe, y-wis.
  I have to longe tristed thee,
  But now it shal no lenger be;                     3930
  For he may best, in every cost,
  Disceyve, that men tristen most.
  I see wel that I am nygh shent,
  But-if I sette my ful entent
  Remedye to purveye.                               3935
  Therfore close I shal the weye
  Fro hem that wol the rose espye,
  And come to wayte me vilanye,
  For, in good feith and in trouthe,
  I wol not lette, for no slouthe,                  3940
  To live the more in sikirnesse,
  [To] make anoon a forteresse,
  [To enclose] the roses of good savour.
  In middis shal I make a tour
  To putte Bialacoil in prisoun,                    3945
  For ever I drede me of tresoun.
  I trowe I shal him kepe so,
  That he shal have no might to go
  Aboute to make companye
  To hem that thenke of vilanye;                    3950
  Ne to no such as hath ben here
  Aforn, and founde in him good chere,
  Which han assailed him to shende,
  And with hir trowandyse to blende.
  A fool is eyth [for] to bigyle;                   3955
  But may I lyve a litel while,
  He shal forthenke his fair semblaunt.'
    And with that word cam Drede avaunt,
  Which was abasshed, and in gret fere,
  Whan he wiste Ielousye was there.                 3960
  He was for drede in such affray,
  That not a word durste he say,
  But quaking stood ful stille aloon,
  Til Ielousye his wey was goon,
  Save Shame, that him not forsook;                 3965
  Bothe Drede and she ful sore quook;
  [Til] that at laste Drede abreyde,
  And to his cosin Shame seyde:
  Shame,' he seide, 'in sothfastnesse,
  To me it is gret hevinesse,                       3970
  That the noyse so fer is go,
  And the sclaundre of us two.
  But sith that it is [so] bifalle,
  We may it not ageyn [do] calle,
  Whan onis sprongen is a fame.                     3975
  For many a yeer withouten blame
  We han been, and many a day;
  For many an April and many a May
  We han [y]-passed, not [a]shamed,
  Til Ielousye hath us blamed                       3980
  Of mistrust and suspecioun
  Causeles, withouten enchesoun.
  Go we to Daunger hastily,
  And late us shewe him openly,
  That he hath not aright [y]-wrought,             3985
  Whan that he sette nought his thought
  To kepe better the purpryse;
  In his doing he is not wyse.
  He hath to us [y]-do gret wrong,
  That hath suffred now so long                     3990
  Bialacoil to have his wille,
  Alle his lustes to fulfille.
  He must amende it utterly,
  Or ellis shal he vilaynsly
  Exyled be out of this londe;                      3995
  For he the werre may not withstonde
  Of Ielousye, nor the greef,
  Sith Bialacoil is at mischeef.'
    To Daunger, Shame and Drede anoon
  The righte wey ben [bothe a]-goon.                4000
  The cherl they founden hem aforn
  Ligging undir an hawethorn.
  Undir his heed no pilowe was,
  But in the stede a trusse of gras.
  He slombred, and a nappe he took,                 4005
  Til Shame pitously him shook,
  And greet manace on him gan make.
  Why slepist thou whan thou shulde wake?'
  Quod Shame; 'thou dost us vilanye!
  Who tristith thee, he doth folye,                 4010
  To kepe roses or botouns,
  Whan they ben faire in hir sesouns.
  Thou art woxe to familiere
  Where thou shulde be straunge of chere,
  Stout of thy port, redy to greve.                 4015
  Thou dost gret foly for to leve
  Bialacoil here-in, to calle
  The yonder man to shenden us alle.
  Though that thou slepe, we may here
  Of Ielousie gret noyse here.                      4020
  Art thou now late? ryse up [in hy],
  And stoppe sone and deliverly
  Alle the gappis of the hay;
  Do no favour, I thee pray.
  It fallith no-thing to thy name                   4025
  Make fair semblaunt, where thou maist blame.
   'If Bialacoil be swete and free,
  Dogged and fel thou shuldist be;
  Froward and outrageous, y-wis;
  A cherl chaungeth that curteis is.                4030
  This have I herd ofte in seying,
  That man [ne] may, for no daunting,
  Make a sperhauke of a bosarde.
  Alle men wole holde thee for musarde,
  That debonair have founden thee,                  4035
  It sit thee nought curteis to be;
  To do men plesaunce or servyse,
  In thee it is recreaundyse.
  Let thy werkis, fer and nere,
  Be lyke thy name, which is Daungere.'             4040
    Than, al abawid in shewing,
  Anoon spak Dreed, right thus seying,
  And seide, 'Daunger, I drede me
  That thou ne wolt [not] bisy be
  To kepe that thou hast to kepe;                   4045
  Whan thou shuldist wake, thou art aslepe.
  Thou shalt be greved certeynly,
  If thee aspye Ielousy,
  Or if he finde thee in blame.
  He hath to-day assailed Shame,                    4050
  And chased awey, with gret manace,
  Bialacoil out of this place,
  And swereth shortly that he shal
  Enclose him in a sturdy wal;
  And al is for thy wikkednesse,                    4055
  For that thee faileth straungenesse.
  Thyn herte, I trowe, be failed al;
  Thou shalt repente in special,
  If Ielousye the sothe knewe;
  Thou shalt forthenke, and sore rewe.'             4060
    With that the cherl his clubbe gan shake,
  Frouning his eyen gan to make,
  And hidous chere; as man in rage,
  For ire he brente in his visage.
  Whan that he herde him blamed so,                 4065
  He seide, 'Out of my wit I go;
  To be discomfit I have gret wrong.
  Certis, I have now lived to long,
  Sith I may not this closer kepe;
  Al quik I wolde be dolven depe,                   4070
  If any man shal more repeire
  Into this garden, for foule or faire.
  Myn herte for ire goth a-fere,
  That I lete any entre here.
  I have do foly, now I see,                        4075
  But now it shal amended bee.
  Who settith foot here any more,
  Truly, he shal repente it sore;
  For no man mo into this place
  Of me to entre shal have grace.                   4080
  Lever I hadde, with swerdis tweyne,
  Thurgh-out myn herte, in every veyne
  Perced to be, with many a wounde,
  Than slouthe shulde in me be founde.
  From hennesforth, by night or day,                4085
  I shal defende it, if I may,
  Withouten any excepcioun
  Of ech maner condicioun;
  And if I any man it graunte,
  Holdeth me for recreaunte.'                       4090
    Than Daunger on his feet gan stonde,
  And hente a burdoun in his honde.
  Wroth in his ire, ne lefte he nought,
  But thurgh the verger he hath sought.
  If he might finde hole or trace,                  4095
  Wher-thurgh that men mot forth-by pace,
  Or any gappe, he dide it close,
  That no man mighte touche a rose
  Of the roser al aboute;
  He shitteth every man withoute.                   4100
    Thus day by day Daunger is wers,
  More wondirful and more divers,
  And feller eek than ever he was;
  For him ful oft I singe 'allas!'
  For I ne may nought, thurgh his ire,              4105
  Recover that I most desire.
  Myn herte, allas, wol brest a-two,
  For Bialacoil I wratthed so.
  For certeynly, in every membre
  I quake, whan I me remembre                       4110
  Of the botoun, which [that] I wolde
  Fulle ofte a day seen and biholde.
  And whan I thenke upon the kisse,
  And how muche Ioye and blisse
  I hadde thurgh the savour swete,                  4115
  For wante of it I grone and grete.
  Me thenkith I fele yit in my nose
  The swete savour of the rose.
  And now I woot that I mot go
  So fer the fresshe floures fro,                   4120
  To me ful welcome were the deeth;
  Absens therof, allas, me sleeth!
  For whylom with this rose, allas,
  I touched nose, mouth, and face;
  But now the deeth I must abyde.                   4125
  But Love consente, another tyde,
  That onis I touche may and kisse,
  I trowe my peyne shal never lisse.
  Theron is al my coveityse,
  Which brent myn herte in many wyse.               4130
  Now shal repaire agayn sighinge,
  Long wacche on nightis, and no slepinge;
  Thought in wisshing, torment, and wo,
  With many a turning to and fro,
  That half my peyne I can not telle.               4135
  For I am fallen into helle
  From paradys and welthe, the more
  My turment greveth; more and more
  Anoyeth now the bittirnesse,
  That I toforn have felt swetnesse.                4140
  And Wikkid-Tunge, thurgh his falshede,
  Causeth al my wo and drede.
  On me he leyeth a pitous charge,
  Bicause his tunge was to large.
    Now it is tyme, shortly that I                  4145
  Telle you som-thing of Ielousy,
  That was in gret suspecioun.
  Aboute him lefte he no masoun,
  That stoon coude leye, ne querrour;
  He hired hem to make a tour.                      4150
  And first, the roses for to kepe,
  Aboute hem made he a diche depe,
  Right wondir large, and also brood;
  Upon the whiche also stood
  Of squared stoon a sturdy wal,                    4155
  Which on a cragge was founded al,
  And right gret thikkenesse eek it bar.
  Abouten, it was founded squar,
  An hundred fadome on every syde,
  It was al liche longe and wyde.                   4160
  Lest any tyme it were assayled,
  Ful wel aboute it was batayled;
  And rounde enviroun eek were set
  Ful many a riche and fair touret.
  At every corner of this wal                       4165
  Was set a tour ful principal;
  And everich hadde, withoute fable,
  A porte-colys defensable
  To kepe of enemies, and to greve,
  That there hir force wolde preve.                 4170
  And eek amidde this purpryse
  Was maad a tour of gret maistryse;
  A fairer saugh no man with sight,
  Large and wyde, and of gret might.
  They [ne] dredde noon assaut                      4175
  Of ginne, gunne, nor skaffaut.
  [For] the temprure of the mortere
  Was maad of licour wonder dere;
  Of quikke lyme persant and egre,
  The which was tempred with vinegre.               4180
  The stoon was hard [as] ademant,
  Wherof they made the foundement.
  The tour was rounde, maad in compas;
  In al this world no richer was,
  Ne better ordeigned therwithal.                   4185
  Aboute the tour was maad a wal,
  So that, bitwixt that and the tour,
  Rosers were set of swete savour,
  With many roses that they bere.
  And eek within the castel were                    4190
  Springoldes, gunnes, bows, archers;
  And eek above, atte corners,
  Men seyn over the walle stonde
  Grete engynes, [whiche] were nigh honde;
  And in the kernels, here and there,               4195
  Of arblasters gret plentee were.
  Noon armure might hir stroke withstonde,
  It were foly to prece to honde.
  Without the diche were listes made,
  With walles batayled large and brade,             4200
  For men and hors shulde not atteyne
  To neigh the diche over the pleyne.
  Thus Ielousye hath enviroun
  Set aboute his garnisoun
  With walles rounde, and diche depe,               4205
  Only the roser for to kepe.
  And Daunger [eek], erly and late
  The keyes kepte of the utter gate,
  The which openeth toward the eest.
  And he hadde with him atte leest                  4210
  Thritty servauntes, echon by name.
    That other gate kepte Shame,
  Which openede, as it was couth,
  Toward the parte of the south.
  Sergeauntes assigned were hir to                  4215
  Ful many, hir wille for to do.
    Than Drede hadde in hir baillye
  The keping of the conestablerye,
  Toward the north, I undirstonde,
  That opened upon the left honde,                  4220
  The which for no-thing may be sure,
  But-if she do [hir] bisy cure
  Erly on morowe and also late,
  Strongly to shette and barre the gate.
  Of every thing that she may see                   4225
  Drede is aferd, wher-so she be;
  For with a puff of litel winde
  Drede is astonied in hir minde.
  Therfore, for stelinge of the rose,
  I rede hir nought the yate unclose.               4230
  A foulis flight wol make hir flee,
  And eek a shadowe, if she it see.
    Thanne Wikked-Tunge, ful of envye,
  With soudiours of Normandye,
  As he that causeth al the bate,                   4235
  Was keper of the fourthe gate,
  And also to the tother three
  He went ful ofte, for to see.
  Whan his lot was to wake a-night,
  His instrumentis wolde he dight,                  4240
  For to blowe and make soun,
  Ofter than he hath enchesoun;
  And walken oft upon the wal,
  Corners and wikettis over-al
  Ful narwe serchen and espye;                      4245
  Though he nought fond, yit wolde he lye.
  Discordaunt ever fro armonye,
  And distoned from melodye,
  Controve he wolde, and foule fayle,
  With hornpypes of Cornewayle.                     4250
  In floytes made he discordaunce,
  And in his musik, with mischaunce,
  He wolde seyn, with notes newe,
  That he [ne] fond no womman trewe,
  Ne that he saugh never, in his lyf,               4255
  Unto hir husbonde a trewe wyf;
  Ne noon so ful of honestee,
  That she nil laughe and mery be
  Whan that she hereth, or may espye,
  A man speken of lecherye.                         4260
  Everich of hem hath somme vyce;
  Oon is dishonest, another is nyce;
  If oon be ful of vilanye,
  Another hath a likerous ye;
  If oon be ful of wantonesse,                      4265
  Another is a chideresse.
    Thus Wikked-Tunge (god yeve him shame!)
  Can putte hem everichone in blame
  Withoute desert and causeles;
  He lyeth, though they been giltles.               4270
  I have pite to seen the sorwe,
  That waketh bothe eve and morwe,
  To innocents doth such grevaunce;
  I pray god yeve him evel chaunce,
  That he ever so bisy is                           4275
  Of any womman to seyn amis!
    Eek Ielousye god confounde,
  That hath [y]-maad a tour so rounde,
  And made aboute a garisoun
  To sette Bialacoil in prisoun;                    4280
  The which is shet there in the tour,
  Ful longe to holde there soiour,
  There for to liven in penaunce.
  And for to do him more grevaunce,
  [Ther] hath ordeyned Ielousye                     4285
  An olde vekke, for to espye
  The maner of his governaunce;
  The whiche devel, in hir enfaunce,
  Had lerned [muche] of Loves art,
  And of his pleyes took hir part;                  4290
  She was [expert] in his servyse.
  She knew ech wrenche and every gyse
  Of love, and every [loveres] wyle,
  It was [the] harder hir to gyle.
  Of Bialacoil she took ay hede,                    4295
  That ever he liveth in wo and drede.
  He kepte him coy and eek privee,
  Lest in him she hadde see
  Any foly countenaunce,
  For she knew al the olde daunce.                  4300
  And aftir this, whan Ielousye
  Had Bialacoil in his baillye,
  And shette him up that was so free,
  For seure of him he wolde be,
  He trusteth sore in his castel;                   4305
  The stronge werk him lyketh wel.
  He dradde nat that no glotouns
  Shulde stele his roses or botouns.
  The roses weren assured alle,
  Defenced with the stronge walle.                  4310
  Now Ielousye ful wel may be
  Of drede devoid, in libertee,
  Whether that he slepe or wake;
  For of his roses may noon be take.
    But I, allas, now morne shal;                   4315
  Bicause I was without the wal,
  Ful moche dole and mone I made.
  Who hadde wist what wo I hadde,
  I trowe he wolde have had pitee.
  Love to deere had sold to me                      4320
  The good that of his love hadde I.
  I [wende a bought] it al queyntly;
  But now, thurgh doubling of my peyn,
  I see he wolde it selle ageyn,
  And me a newe bargeyn lere,                       4325
  The which al-out the more is dere,
  For the solace that I have lorn,
  Than I hadde it never aforn.
  Certayn I am ful lyk, indeed,
  To him that cast in erthe his seed;               4330
  And hath Ioie of the newe spring,
  Whan it greneth in the ginning,
  And is also fair and fresh of flour,
  Lusty to seen, swote of odour;
  But er he it in sheves shere,                     4335
  May falle a weder that shal it dere,
  And maken it to fade and falle,
  The stalk, the greyn, and floures alle;
  That to the tilier is fordone
  The hope that he hadde to sone.                   4340
  I drede, certeyn, that so fare I;
  For hope and travaile sikerly
  Ben me biraft al with a storm;
  The floure nil seden of my corn.
  For Love hath so avaunced me,                     4345
  Whan I bigan my privitee
  To Bialacoil al for to telle,
  Whom I ne fond froward ne felle,
  But took a-gree al hool my play.
  But Love is of so hard assay,                     4350
  That al at onis he reved me,
  Whan I wend best aboven have be.
  It is of Love, as of Fortune,
  That chaungeth ofte, and nil contune;
  Which whylom wol on folke smyle,                  4355
  And gloumbe on hem another whyle;
  Now freend, now foo, [thou] shalt hir fele,
  For [in] a twinkling tourneth hir wheel.
  She can wrythe hir heed awey,
  This is the concours of hir pley;                 4360
  She can areyse that doth morne,
  And whirle adown, and overturne
  Who sittith hieghst, [al] as hir list;
  A fool is he that wol hir trist.
  For it [am] I that am com doun                    4365
  Thurgh change and revolucioun!
  Sith Bialacoil mot fro me twinne,
  Shet in the prisoun yond withinne,
  His absence at myn herte I fele;
  For al my Ioye and al myn hele                    4370
  Was in him and in the rose,
  That but yon [wal], which him doth close,
  Open, that I may him see,
  Love nil not that I cured be
  Of the peynes that I endure,                      4375
  Nor of my cruel aventure.
    A, Bialacoil, myn owne dere!
  Though thou be now a prisonere,
  Kepe atte leste thyn herte to me,
  And suffre not that it daunted be;                4380
  Ne lat not Ielousye, in his rage,
  Putten thyn herte in no servage.
  Although he chastice thee withoute,
  And make thy body unto him loute,
  Have herte as hard as dyamaunt,                   4385
  Stedefast, and nought pliaunt;
  In prisoun though thy body be,
  At large kepe thyn herte free.
  A trewe herte wol not plye
  For no manace that it may drye.                   4390
  If Ielousye doth thee payne,
  Quyte him his whyle thus agayne,
  To venge thee, atte leest in thought,
  If other way thou mayest nought;
  And in this wyse sotilly                          4395
  Worche, and winne the maistry.
  But yit I am in gret affray
  Lest thou do not as I say;
  I drede thou canst me greet maugree,
  That thou emprisoned art for me;                  4400
  But that [is] not for my trespas,
  For thurgh me never discovered was
  Yit thing that oughte be secree.
  Wel more anoy [ther] is in me,
  Than is in thee, of this mischaunce;              4405
  For I endure more hard penaunce
  Than any [man] can seyn or thinke,
  That for the sorwe almost I sinke.
  Whan I remembre me of my wo,
  Ful nygh out of my wit I go.                      4410
  Inward myn herte I fele blede,
  For comfortles the deeth I drede.
  Ow I not wel to have distresse,
  Whan false, thurgh hir wikkednesse,
  And traitours, that arn envyous,                  4415
  To noyen me be so coragious?
    A, Bialacoil! ful wel I see,
  That they hem shape to disceyve thee,
  To make thee buxom to hir lawe,
  And with hir corde thee to drawe                  4420
  Wher-so hem lust, right at hir wil;
  I drede they have thee brought thertil.
  Withoute comfort, thought me sleeth;
  This game wol bringe me to my deeth.
  For if your gode wille I lese,                    4425
  I mote be deed; I may not chese.
  And if that thou foryete me,
  Myn herte shal never in lyking be;
  Nor elles-where finde solace,
  If I be put out of your grace,                    4430
  As it shal never been, I hope;
  Than shulde I fallen in wanhope.

[_Here, at_ l. 4070 _of the_ French text, _ends the work of_ G. de Lorris;
_and begins the work of_ Jean de Meun.]

    Allas, in wanhope?--nay, pardee!
  For I wol never dispeired be.
  If Hope me faile, than am I                       4435
  Ungracious and unworthy;
  In Hope I wol comforted be,
  For Love, whan he bitaught hir me,
  Seide, that Hope, wher-so I go,
  Shulde ay be relees to my wo.                     4440
    But what and she my balis bete,
  And be to me curteis and swete?
  She is in no-thing ful certeyn.
  Lovers she put in ful gret peyn,
  And makith hem with wo to dele.                   4445
  Hir fair biheest disceyveth fele,
  For she wol bihote, sikirly,
  And failen aftir outrely.
  A! that is a ful noyous thing!
  For many a lover, in loving,                      4450
  Hangeth upon hir, and trusteth fast,
  Whiche lese hir travel at the last.
  Of thing to comen she woot right nought;
  Therfore, if it be wysly sought,
  Hir counseille, foly is to take.                  4455
  For many tymes, whan she wol make
  A ful good silogisme, I drede
  That aftirward ther shal in dede
  Folwe an evel conclusioun;
  This put me in confusioun.                        4460
  For many tymes I have it seen,
  That many have bigyled been,
  For trust that they have set in Hope,
  Which fel hem aftirward a-slope.
    But natheles yit, gladly she wolde,             4465
  That he, that wol him with hir holde,
  Hadde alle tymes [his] purpos clere,
  Withoute deceyte, or any were.
  That she desireth sikirly;
  Whan I hir blamed, I did foly.                    4470
  But what avayleth hir good wille,
  Whan she ne may staunche my stounde ille?
  That helpith litel, that she may do,
  Outake biheest unto my wo.
  And heeste certeyn, in no wyse,                   4475
  Withoute yift, is not to pryse.
    Whan heest and deed a-sundir varie,
  They doon [me have] a gret contrarie.
  Thus am I possed up and doun
  With dool, thought, and confusioun;               4480
  Of my disese ther is no noumbre.
  Daunger and Shame me encumbre,
  Drede also, and Ielousye,
  And Wikked-Tunge, ful of envye,
  Of whiche the sharpe and cruel ire                4485
  Ful oft me put in gret martire.
  They han my Ioye fully let,
  Sith Bialacoil they have bishet
  Fro me in prisoun wikkidly,
  Whom I love so entierly,                          4490
  That it wol my bane be,
  But I the soner may him see.
  And yit moreover, wurst of alle,
  Ther is set to kepe, foule hir bifalle!
  A rimpled vekke, fer ronne in age,                4495
  Frowning and yelowe in hir visage,
  Which in awayte lyth day and night,
  That noon of hem may have a sight.
  Now moot my sorwe enforced be;
  Ful soth it is, that Love yaf me                  4500
  Three wonder yiftes of his grace,
  Which I have lorn now in this place,
  Sith they ne may, withoute drede
  Helpen but litel, who taketh hede.
  For here availeth no Swete-Thought,               4505
  And Swete-Speche helpith right nought.
  The thridde was called Swete-Loking,
  That now is lorn, without lesing.
  [The] yiftes were fair, but not forthy
  They helpe me but simply,                         4510
  But Bialacoil [may] loosed be,
  To gon at large and to be free.
  For him my lyf lyth al in dout,
  But-if he come the rather out.
  Allas! I trowe it wol not been!                   4515
  For how shuld I evermore him seen?
  He may not out, and that is wrong,
  Bicause the tour is so strong.
  How shulde he out? by whos prowesse,
  Out of so strong a forteresse?                    4520
  By me, certeyn, it nil be do;
  God woot, I have no wit therto!
  But wel I woot I was in rage,
  Whan I to Love dide homage.
  Who was in cause, in sothfastnesse,               4525
  But hir-silf, dame Idelnesse,
  Which me conveyed, thurgh fair prayere,
  To entre into that fair vergere?
  She was to blame me to leve,
  The which now doth me sore greve.                 4530
  A foolis word is nought to trowe,
  Ne worth an appel for to lowe;
  Men shulde him snibbe bittirly,
  At pryme temps of his foly.
  I was a fool, and she me leved,                   4535
  Thurgh whom I am right nought releved.
  She accomplisshed al my wil,
  That now me greveth wondir il.
  Resoun me seide what shulde falle.
  A fool my-silf I may wel calle,                   4540
  That love asyde I had not leyde,
  And trowed that dame Resoun seyde.
  Resoun had bothe skile and right.
  Whan she me blamed, with al hir might,
  To medle of love, that hath me shent;             4545
  But certeyn now I wol repent.
   'And shulde I repent? Nay, parde!
  A fals traitour than shulde I be.
  The develles engins wolde me take,
  If I my [lorde] wolde forsake,                    4550
  Or Bialacoil falsly bitraye.
  Shulde I at mischeef hate him? nay,
  Sith he now, for his curtesye,
  Is in prisoun of Ielousye.
  Curtesye certeyn dide he me,                      4555
  So muche, it may not yolden be,
  Whan he the hay passen me lete,
  To kisse the rose, faire and swete;
  Shulde I therfore cunne him maugree?
  Nay, certeynly, it shal not be;                   4560
  For Love shal never, [if god wil],
  Here of me, thurgh word or wil,
  Offence or complaynt, more or lesse,
  Neither of Hope nor Idilnesse;
  For certis, it were wrong that I                  4565
  Hated hem for hir curtesye.
  Ther is not ellis, but suffre and thinke,
  And waken whan I shulde winke;
  Abyde in hope, til Love, thurgh chaunce,
  Sende me socour or allegeaunce,                   4570
  Expectant ay til I may mete
  To geten mercy of that swete.
   'Whylom I thinke how Love to me
  Seyde he wolde taken atte gree
  My servise, if unpacience                         4575
  Caused me to doon offence.
  He seyde, "In thank I shal it take,
  And high maister eek thee make,
  If wikkednesse ne reve it thee;
  But sone, I trowe, that shal not be."             4580
  These were his wordis by and by;
  It semed he loved me trewly.
  Now is ther not but serve him wele,
  If that I thinke his thank to fele.
  My good, myn harm, lyth hool in me;               4585
  In Love may no defaute be;
  For trewe Love ne failid never man.
  Sothly, the faute mot nedis than
  (As God forbede!) be founde in me,
  And how it cometh, I can not see.                 4590
  Now lat it goon as it may go;
  Whether Love wol socoure me or slo,
  He may do hool on me his wil.
  I am so sore bounde him til,
  From his servyse I may not fleen;                 4595
  For lyf and deth, withouten wene,
  Is in his hand; I may not chese;
  He may me do bothe winne and lese.
  And sith so sore he doth me greve,
  Yit, if my lust he wolde acheve                   4600
  To Bialacoil goodly to be,
  I yeve no force what felle on me.
  For though I dye, as I mot nede,
  I praye Love, of his goodlihede,
  To Bialacoil do gentilnesse,                      4605
  For whom I live in such distresse,
  That I mote deyen for penaunce.
  But first, withoute repentaunce,
  I wol me confesse in good entent,
  And make in haste my testament,                   4610
  As lovers doon that felen smerte:--
  To Bialacoil leve I myn herte
  Al hool, withoute departing,
  Or doublenesse of repenting.'

      COMENT RAISOUN VIENT A L'AMANT.

    Thus as I made my passage                       4615
  In compleynt, and in cruel rage,
  And I not wher to finde a leche
  That couthe unto myn helping eche,
  Sodeynly agayn comen doun
  Out of hir tour I saugh Resoun,                   4620
  Discrete and wys, and ful plesaunt,
  And of hir porte ful avenaunt.
  The righte wey she took to me,
  Which stood in greet perplexite,
  That was posshed in every side,                   4625
  That I nist where I might abyde,
  Til she, demurely sad of chere,
  Seide to me as she com nere:--
   'Myn owne freend, art thou yit greved?
  How is this quarel yit acheved                    4630
  Of Loves syde? Anoon me telle;

  Art thou not wery of thy servyse
  That thee hath [pyned] in sich wyse?
  What Ioye hast thou in thy loving?                4635
  Is it swete or bitter thing?
  Canst thou yit chese, lat me see,
  What best thy socour mighte be?
   'Thou servest a ful noble lord,
  That maketh thee thral for thy reward,            4640
  Which ay renewith thy turment,
  With foly so he hath thee blent.
  Thou felle in mischeef thilke day,
  Whan thou didest, the sothe to say,
  Obeysaunce and eek homage;                        4645
  Thou wroughtest no-thing as the sage.
  Whan thou bicam his liege man,
  Thou didist a gret foly than;
  Thou wistest not what fel therto,
  With what lord thou haddist to do.                4650
  If thou haddist him wel knowe,
  Thou haddist nought be brought so lowe;
  For if thou wistest what it were,
  Thou noldist serve him half a yeer,
  Not a weke, nor half a day,                       4655
  Ne yit an hour withoute delay,
  Ne never [han] loved paramours,
  His lordship is so ful of shoures.
  Knowest him ought?'
    _L'Amaunt._  'Ye, dame, parde!'
    _Raisoun._  'Nay, nay.'
    _L'Amaunt._        'Yes, I.'
    _Raisoun._              'Wherof, lat see?'      4660
    _L'Amaunt._  'Of that he seyde I shulde be
  Glad to have sich lord as he,
  And maister of sich seignory.'
    _Raisoun._  'Knowist him no more?'
    _L'Amaunt._        'Nay, certis, I,
  Save that he yaf me rewles there,                 4665
  And wente his wey, I niste where,
  And I abood bounde in balaunce.'
    _Raisoun._ 'Lo, there a noble conisaunce!
  But I wil that thou knowe him now
  Ginning and ende, sith that thou                  4670
  Art so anguisshous and mate,
  Disfigured out of astate;
  Ther may no wrecche have more of wo,
  Ne caitif noon enduren so.
  It were to every man sitting                      4675
  Of his lord have knowleching.
  For if thou knewe him, out of dout,
  Lightly thou shulde escapen out
  Of the prisoun that marreth thee.'
    _L'Amaunt._ 'Ye, dame! sith my lord is he,      4680
  And I his man, maad with myn honde,
  I wolde right fayn undirstonde
  To knowen of what kinde he be,
  If any wolde enferme me.'
    _Raisoun._ 'I wolde,' seid Resoun, 'thee lere,  4685
  Sith thou to lerne hast sich desire,
  And shewe thee, withouten fable,
  A thing that is not demonstrable.
  Thou shalt [here lerne] without science,
  And  knowe, withoute experience,                  4690
  The thing that may not knowen be,
  Ne wist ne shewid in no degree.
  Thou mayst the sothe of it not witen,
  Though in thee it were writen.
  Thou shalt not knowe therof more                  4695
  Whyle thou art reuled by his lore;
  But unto him that love wol flee,
  The knotte may unclosed be,
  Which hath to thee, as it is founde,
  So long be knet and not unbounde.                 4700
  Now sette wel thyn entencioun,
  To here of love discripcioun.
   'Love, it is an hateful pees,
  A free acquitaunce, without relees,
  [A trouthe], fret full of falshede,               4705
  A sikernesse, al set in drede;
  In herte is a dispeiring hope,
  And fulle of hope, it is wanhope;
  Wyse woodnesse, and wood resoun,
  A swete peril, in to droune,                      4710
  An hevy birthen, light to bere,
  A wikked wawe awey to were.
  It is Caribdis perilous,
  Disagreable and gracious.
  It is discordaunce that can accorde,              4715
  And accordaunce to discorde.
  It is cunning withoute science,
  Wisdom withoute sapience,
  Wit withoute discrecioun,
  Havoir, withoute possessioun.                     4720
  It is sike hele and hool siknesse,
  A thrust drowned [in] dronkenesse,
  An helthe ful of maladye,
  And charitee ful of envye,
  An [hunger] ful of habundaunce,                   4725
  And a gredy suffisaunce;
  Delyt right ful of hevinesse,
  And drerihed ful of gladnesse;
  Bitter swetnesse and swete errour,
  Right evel savoured good savour;                  4730
  Sinne that pardoun hath withinne,
  And pardoun spotted without [with] sinne;
  A peyne also it is, Ioyous,
  And felonye right pitous;
  Also pley that selde is stable,                   4735
  And stedefast [stat], right mevable;
  A strengthe, weyked to stonde upright,
  And feblenesse, ful of might;
  Wit unavysed, sage folye,
  And Ioye ful of turmentrye;                       4740
  A laughter it is, weping ay,
  Rest, that traveyleth night and day;
  Also a swete helle it is,
  And a sorowful Paradys;
  A plesaunt gayl and esy prisoun,                  4745
  And, ful of froste, somer sesoun;
  Pryme temps, ful of frostes whyte,
  And May, devoide of al delyte,
  With seer braunches, blossoms ungrene;
  And newe fruyt, fillid with winter tene.          4750
  It is a slowe, may not forbere
  Ragges, ribaned with gold, to were;
  For al-so wel wol love be set
  Under ragges as riche rochet;
  And eek as wel be amourettes                      4755
  In mourning blak, as bright burnettes.
  For noon is of so mochel prys,
  Ne no man founden [is] so wys,
  Ne noon so high is of parage,
  Ne no man founde of wit so sage,                  4760
  No man so hardy ne so wight,
  Ne no man of so mochel might,
  Noon so fulfilled of bounte,
  [But] he with love may daunted be.
  Al the world holdith this way;                    4765
  Love makith alle to goon miswey,
  But it be they of yvel lyf,
  Whom Genius cursith, man and wyf,
  That wrongly werke ageyn nature.
  Noon suche I love, ne have no cure                4770
  Of suche as Loves servaunts been,
  And wol not by my counsel fleen.
  For I ne preyse that loving,
  Wher-thurgh man, at the laste ending,
  Shal calle hem wrecchis fulle of wo,              4775
  Love greveth hem and shendith so.
  But if thou wolt wel Love eschewe,
  For to escape out of his mewe,
  And make al hool thy sorwe to slake,
  No bettir counsel mayst thou take,                4780
  Than thinke to fleen wel, y-wis;
  May nought helpe elles; for wite thou this:--
  If thou flee it, it shal flee thee;
  Folowe it, and folowen shal it thee.'
    _L'Amaunt._ Whan I hadde herd al Resoun seyn,   4785
  Which hadde spilt hir speche in veyn:
  Dame,' seyde I, 'I dar wel sey
  Of this avaunt me wel I may
  That from your scole so deviaunt

  Right nought am I, thurgh your doctryne;
  I dulle under your disciplyne;
  I wot no more than [I] wist [er],
  To me so contrarie and so fer
  Is every thing that ye me lere;                   4795
  And yit I can it al parcuere.
  Myn herte foryetith therof right nought,
  It is so writen in my thought;
  And depe graven it is so tendir
  That al by herte I can it rendre,                 4800
  And rede it over comunely;
  But to my-silf lewedist am I.
   'But sith ye love discreven so,
  And lakke and preise it, bothe two,
  Defyneth it into this letter,                     4805
  That I may thenke on it the better;
  For I herde never [diffyne it ere],
  And wilfully I wolde it lere.'
    _Raisoun._ 'If love be serched wel and sought,
  It is a sykenesse of the thought                  4810
  Annexed and knet bitwixe tweyne,
  [Which] male and female, with oo cheyne,
  So frely byndith, that they nil twinne,
  Whether so therof they lese or winne.
  The roote springith, thurgh hoot brenning,        4815
  Into disordinat desiring
  For to kissen and enbrace,
  And at her lust them to solace.
  Of other thing love recchith nought,
  But setteth hir herte and al hir thought          4820
  More for delectacioun
  Than any procreacioun
  Of other fruyt by engendring;
  Which love to god is not plesing;
  For of hir body fruyt to get                      4825
  They yeve no force, they are so set
  Upon delyt, to pley in-fere.
  And somme have also this manere,
  To feynen hem for love seke;
  Sich love I preise not at a leke.                 4830
  For paramours they do but feyne;
  To love truly they disdeyne.
  They falsen ladies traitoursly,
  And sweren hem othes utterly,
  With many a lesing, and many a fable,             4835
  And al they finden deceyvable.
  And, whan they her lust han geten,
  The hoote ernes they al foryeten.
  Wimmen, the harm they byen ful sore;
  But men this thenken evermore,                    4840
  That lasse harm is, so mote I thee,
  Disceyve them, than disceyved be;
  And namely, wher they ne may
  Finde non other mene wey.
  For I wot wel, in sothfastnesse,                  4845
  That [who] doth now his bisynesse
  With any womman for to dele,
  For any lust that he may fele,
  But-if it be for engendrure,
  He doth trespasse, I you ensure.                  4850
  For he shulde setten al his wil
  To geten a likly thing him til,
  And to sustene[n], if he might,
  And kepe forth, by kindes right,
  His owne lyknesse and semblable,                  4855
  For bicause al is corumpable,
  And faile shulde successioun,
  Ne were ther generacioun
  Our sectis strene for to save.
  Whan fader or moder arn in grave,                 4860
  Hir children shulde, whan they ben deede,
  Ful diligent ben, in hir steede,
  To use that werke on such a wyse,
  That oon may thurgh another ryse.
  Therfore set Kinde therin delyt,                  4865
  For men therin shulde hem delyte,
  And of that dede be not erke,
  But ofte sythes haunt that werke.
  For noon wolde drawe therof a draught
  Ne were delyt, which hath him caught.             4870
  This hadde sotil dame Nature;
  For noon goth right, I thee ensure,
  Ne hath entent hool ne parfyt;
  For hir desir is for delyt,
  The which fortened crece and eke                  4875
  The pley of love for-ofte seke,
  And thralle hem-silf, they be so nyce,
  Unto the prince of every vyce.
  For of ech sinne it is the rote,
  Unlefulle lust, though it be sote,                4880
  And of al yvel the racyne,
  As Tullius can determyne,
  Which in his tyme was ful sage,
  In a boke he made of Age,
  Wher that more he preyseth Elde,                  4885
  Though he be croked and unwelde,
  And more of commendacioun,
  Than Youthe in his discripcioun.
  For Youthe set bothe man and wyf
  In al perel of soule and lyf;                     4890
  And perel is, but men have grace,
  The [tyme] of youthe for to pace,
  Withoute any deth or distresse,
  It is so ful of wildenesse;
  So ofte it doth shame or damage                   4895
  To him or to his linage.
  It ledith man now up, now doun,
  In mochel dissolucioun,
  And makith him love yvel company,
  And lede his lyf disrewlily,                      4900
  And halt him payed with noon estate.
  Within him-silf is such debate,
  He chaungith purpos and entent,
  And yalt [him] into som covent,
  To liven aftir her empryse,                       4905
  And lesith fredom and fraunchyse,
  That Nature in him hadde set,
  The which ageyn he may not get,
  If he there make his mansioun
  For to abyde professioun.                         4910
  Though for a tyme his herte absente,
  It may not fayle, he shal repente,
  And eke abyde thilke day
  To leve his abit, and goon his way,
  And lesith his worship and his name,              4915
  And dar not come ageyn for shame;
  But al his lyf he doth so mourne,
  Bicause he dar not hoom retourne.
  Fredom of kinde so lost hath he
  That never may recured be,                        4920
  But-if that god him graunte grace
  That he may, er he hennes pace,
  Conteyne undir obedience
  Thurgh the vertu of pacience.
  For Youthe set man in al folye,                   4925
  In unthrift and in ribaudye,
  In leccherye, and in outrage,
  So ofte it chaungith of corage.
  Youthe ginneth ofte sich bargeyn,
  That may not ende withouten peyn.                 4930
  In gret perel is set youth-hede,
  Delyt so doth his bridil lede.
  Delyt thus hangith, drede thee nought,
  Bothe mannis body and his thought,
  Only thurgh Youthe, his chamberere,               4935
  That to don yvel is customere,
  And of nought elles taketh hede
  But only folkes for to lede
  Into disporte and wildenesse,
  So is [she] froward from sadnesse.                4940
   'But Elde drawith hem therfro;
  Who wot it nought, he may wel go
  [Demand] of hem that now arn olde,
  That whylom Youthe hadde in holde,
  Which yit remembre of tendir age,                 4945
  How it hem brought in many a rage,
  And many a foly therin wrought.
  But now that Elde hath hem thurghsought,
  They repente hem of her folye,
  That Youthe hem putte in Iupardye,                4950
  In perel and in muche wo,
  And made hem ofte amis to do,
  And suen yvel companye,
  Riot and avouterye.
   'But Elde [can] ageyn restreyne                  4955
  From suche foly, and refreyne,
  And set men, by hir ordinaunce,
  In good reule and in governaunce.
  But yvel she spendith hir servyse,
  For no man wol hir love, ne pryse;                4960
  She is hated, this wot I wele.
  Hir acqueyntaunce wolde no man fele,
  Ne han of Elde companye,
  Men hate to be of hir alye.
  For no man wolde bicomen olde,                    4965
  Ne dye, whan he is yong and bolde.
  And Elde merveilith right gretly,
  Whan they remembre hem inwardly
  Of many a perelous empryse,
  Whiche that they wrought in sondry wyse,          4970
  How ever they might, withoute blame,
  Escape awey withoute shame,
  In youthe, withoute[n] damage
  Or repreef of her linage,
  Losse of membre, sheding of blode,                4975
  Perel of deth, or losse of good.
   'Wost thou nought where Youthe abit,
  That men so preisen in her wit?
  With Delyt she halt soiour,
  For bothe they dwellen in oo tour.                4980
  As longe as Youthe is in sesoun,
  They dwellen in oon mansioun.
  Delyt of Youthe wol have servyse
  To do what so he wol devyse;
  And Youthe is redy evermore                       4985
  For to obey, for smerte of sore,
  Unto Delyt, and him to yive
  Hir servise, whyl that she may live.
   'Where Elde abit, I wol thee telle
  Shortly, and no whyle dwelle,                     4990
  For thider bihoveth thee to go.
  If Deth in youthe thee not slo,
  Of this journey thou maist not faile.

  With cruel Deth they hir present,
  And tellen hir, erliche and late,
  That Deth stant armed at hir gate.
  Than bringe they to hir remembraunce              5005
  The foly dedis of hir infaunce,
  Which causen hir to mourne in wo
  That Youthe hath hir bigiled so,
  Which sodeynly awey is hasted.
  She wepeth the tyme that she hath wasted,         5010
  Compleyning of the preterit,
  And the present, that not abit,
  And of hir olde vanitee,
  That, but aforn hir she may see
  In the future som socour,                         5015
  To leggen hir of hir dolour,
  To graunt hir tyme of repentaunce,
  For hir sinnes to do penaunce,
  And at the laste so hir governe
  To winne the Ioy that is eterne,                  5020
  Fro which go bakward Youthe [hir] made,
  In vanitee to droune and wade.
  For present tyme abidith nought,
  It is more swift than any thought;
  So litel whyle it doth endure                     5025
  That ther nis compte ne mesure.
   'But how that ever the game go,
  Who list [have] Ioye and mirth also
  Of love, be it he or she,
  High or lowe, who[so] it be,                      5030
  In fruyt they shulde hem delyte;
  Her part they may not elles quyte,
  To save hem-silf in honestee.
  And yit ful many oon I see
  Of wimmen, sothly for to seyne,                   5035
  That [ay] desire and wolde fayne
  The pley of love, they be so wilde,
  And not coveite to go with childe.
  And if with child they be perchaunce,
  They wole it holde a gret mischaunce;             5040
  But what-som-ever wo they fele,
  They wol not pleyne, but concele;
  But-if it be any fool or nyce,
  In whom that shame hath no Iustyce.
  For to delyt echon they drawe,                    5045
  That haunte this werk, bothe high and lawe,
  Save sich that ar[e]n worth right nought,
  That for money wol be bought.
  Such love I preise in no wyse,
  Whan it is given for coveitise.                   5050
  I preise no womman, though [she] be wood,
  That yeveth hir-silf for any good.
  For litel shulde a man telle
  Of hir, that wol hir body selle,
  Be she mayde, be she wyf,                         5055
  That quik wol selle hir, by hir lyf.
  How faire chere that ever she make,
  He is a wrecche, I undirtake,
  That loveth such one, for swete or sour,
  Though she him calle hir paramour,                5060
  And laugheth on him, and makith him feeste.
  For certeynly no suche [a] beeste
  To be loved is not worthy,
  Or bere the name of druery.
  Noon shulde hir please, but he were wood,         5065
  That wol dispoile him of his good.
  Yit nevertheles, I wol not sey
  [But] she, for solace and for pley,
  May a Iewel or other thing
  Take of her loves free yeving;                    5070
  But that she aske it in no wyse,
  For drede of shame of coveityse.
  And she of hirs may him, certeyn,
  Withoute sclaundre, yeven ageyn,
  And ioyne her hertes togidre so                   5075
  In love, and take and yeve also.
  Trowe not that I wolde hem twinne,
  Whan in her love ther is no sinne;
  I wol that they togedre go,
  And doon al that they han ado,                    5080
  As curteis shulde and debonaire,
  And in her love beren hem faire,
  Withoute vyce, bothe he and she;
  So that alwey, in honestee,
  Fro foly love [they] kepe hem clere               5085
  That brenneth hertis with his fere;
  And that her love, in any wyse,
  Be devoid of coveityse.
  Good love shulde engendrid be
  Of trewe herte, iust, and secree,                 5090
  And not of such as sette her thought
  To have her lust, and ellis nought,
  So are they caught in Loves lace,
  Truly, for bodily solace.
  Fleshly delyt is so present                       5095
  With thee, that sette al thyn entent,
  Withoute more (what shulde I glose?)
  For to gete and have the Rose;
  Which makith thee so mate and wood
  That thou desirest noon other good.               5100
  But thou art not an inche the nerre,
  But ever abydest in sorwe and werre,
  As in thy face it is sene;
  It makith thee bothe pale and lene;
  Thy might, thy vertu goth away.                   5105
  A sory gest, in goode fay,
  Thou [herberedest than] in thyn inne,
  The God of Love whan thou let inne!
  Wherfore I rede, thou shette him out,
  Or he shal greve thee, out of doute;              5110
  For to thy profit it wol turne,
  If he nomore with thee soiourne.
  In gret mischeef and sorwe sonken
  Ben hertis, that of love arn dronken,
  As thou peraventure knowen shal,                  5115
  Whan thou hast lost [thy] tyme al,
  And spent [thy youthe] in ydilnesse,
  In waste, and woful lustinesse;
  If thou maist live the tyme to see
  Of love for to delivered be,                      5120
  Thy tyme thou shall biwepe sore
  The whiche never thou maist restore.
  (For tyme lost, as men may see,
  For no-thing may recured be).
  And if thou scape yit, atte laste,                5125
  Fro Love, that hath thee so faste
  Knit and bounden in his lace,
  Certeyn, I holde it but a grace.
  For many oon, as it is seyn,
  Have lost, and spent also in veyn,                5130
  In his servyse, withoute socour,
  Body and soule, good, and tresour,
  Wit, and strengthe, and eek richesse,
  Of which they hadde never redresse.'
    Thus taught and preched hath Resoun,            5135
  But Love spilte hir sermoun,
  That was so imped in my thought,
  That hir doctrine I sette at nought.
  And yit ne seide she never a dele,
  That I ne understode it wele,                     5140
  Word by word, the mater al.
  But unto Love I was so thral,
  Which callith over-al his pray,
  He chasith so my thought [alway],
  And holdith myn herte undir his sele,             5145
  As trust and trew as any stele;
  So that no devocioun
  Ne hadde I in the sermoun
  Of dame Resoun, ne of hir rede;
  It toke no soiour in myn hede.                    5150
  For alle yede out at oon ere
  That in that other she dide lere;
  Fully on me she lost hir lore,
  Hir speche me greved wondir sore.
    [Than] unto hir for ire I seide,                5155
  For anger, as I dide abraide:
  Dame, and is it your wille algate,
  That I not love, but that I hate
  Alle men, as ye me teche?
  For if I do aftir your speche,                    5160
  Sith that ye seyn love is not good,
  Than must I nedis say with mood,
  If I it leve, in hatrede ay
  Liven, and voide love away
  From me, [and been] a sinful wrecche,             5165
  Hated of all that [love that] tecche.
  I may not go noon other gate,
  For either must I love or hate.
  And if I hate men of-newe
  More than love, it wol me rewe,                   5170
  As by your preching semeth me,
  For Love no-thing ne preisith thee.
  Ye yeve good counseil, sikirly,
  That prechith me al-day, that I
  Shulde not Loves lore alowe;                      5175
  He were a fool, wolde you not trowe!
  In speche also ye han me taught
  Another love, that knowen is naught,
  Which I have herd you not repreve,
  To love ech other; by your leve,                  5180
  If ye wolde diffyne it me,
  I wolde gladly here, to see,
  At the leest, if I may lere
  Of sondry loves the manere.'
    _Raison._ 'Certis, freend, a fool art thou      5185
  Whan that thou no-thing wolt allowe
  That I [thee] for thy profit say.
  Yit wol I sey thee more, in fay;
  For I am redy, at the leste,
  To accomplisshe thy requeste,                     5190
  But I not wher it wol avayle;
  In veyne, perauntre, I shal travayle.
  Love ther is in sondry wyse,
  As I shal thee here devyse.
  For som love leful is and good;                   5195
  I mene not that which makith thee wood,
  And bringith thee in many a fit,
  And ravisshith fro thee al thy wit,
  It is so merveilous and queynt;
  With such love be no more aqueynt.                5200

      COMMENT RAISOUN DIFFINIST AMISTIE.

   'Love of Frendshipe also ther is,
  Which makith no man doon amis,
  Of wille knit bitwixe two,
  That wol not breke for wele ne wo;
  Which long is lykly to contune,                   5205
  Whan wille and goodis ben in comune;
  Grounded by goddis ordinaunce,
  Hool, withoute discordaunce;
  With hem holding comuntee
  Of al her goode in charitee,                      5210
  That ther be noon excepcioun
  Thurgh chaunging of entencioun;
  That ech helpe other at hir neede,
  And wysly hele bothe word and dede;
  Trewe of mening, devoid of slouthe,               5215
  For wit is nought withoute trouthe;
  So that the ton dar al his thought
  Seyn to his freend, and spare nought,
  As to him-silf, without dreding
  To be discovered by wreying.                      5220
  For glad is that coniunccioun,
  Whan ther is noon suspecioun
  [Ne lak in hem], whom they wolde prove
  That trew and parfit weren in love.
  For no man may be amiable,                        5225
  But-if he be so ferme and stable,
  That fortune chaunge him not, ne blinde,
  But that his freend alwey him finde,
  Bothe pore and riche, in oon [e]state.
  For if his freend, thurgh any gate,               5230
  Wol compleyne of his povertee,
  He shulde not byde so long, til he
  Of his helping him requere;
  For good deed, done [but] thurgh prayere,
  Is sold, and bought to dere, y-wis,               5235
  To hert that of gret valour is.
  For hert fulfilled of gentilnesse
  Can yvel demene his distresse.
  And man that worthy is of name
  To asken often hath gret shame.                   5240
  A good man brenneth in his thought
  For shame, whan he axeth ought.
  He hath gret thought, and dredith ay
  For his disese, whan he shal pray
  His freend, lest that he warned be,               5245
  Til that he preve his stabiltee.
  But whan that he hath founden oon
  That trusty is and trew as stone,
  And [hath] assayed him at al,
  And found him stedefast as a wal,                 5250
  And of his freendship be certeyne,
  He shal him shewe bothe Ioye and peyne,
  And al that [he] dar thinke or sey,
  Withoute shame, as he wel may.
  For how shulde he ashamed be                      5255
  Of sich oon as I tolde thee?
  For whan he woot his secree thought,
  The thridde shal knowe ther-of right nought;
  For tweyn in nombre is bet than three
  In every counsel and secree.                      5260
  Repreve he dredeth never a del,
  Who that biset his wordis wel;
  For every wys man, out of drede,
  Can kepe his tunge til he see nede;
  And fooles can not holde hir tunge;               5265
  A fooles belle is sone runge.
  Yit shal a trewe freend do more
  To helpe his felowe of his sore,
  And socoure him, whan he hath nede,
  In al that he may doon in dede;                   5270
  And gladder [be] that he him plesith
  Than [is] his felowe that he esith.
  And if he do not his requeste,
  He shal as mochel him moleste
  As his felow, for that he                         5275
  May not fulfille his voluntee
  [As] fully as he hath requered.
  If bothe the hertis Love hath fered,
  Joy and wo they shul depart,
  And take evenly ech his part.                     5280
  Half his anoy he shal have ay,
  And comfort [him] what that he may;
  And of his blisse parte shal he,
  If love wol departed be.
   'And whilom of this [amitee]                     5285
  Spak Tullius in a ditee;
  ["A man] shulde maken his request
  Unto his freend, that is honest;
  And he goodly shulde it fulfille,
  But it the more were out of skile,                5290
  And otherwise not graunt therto,
  Except only in [cases] two:
  If men his freend to deth wolde dryve,
  Lat him be bisy to save his lyve.
  Also if men wolen him assayle,                    5295
  Of his wurship to make him faile,
  And hindren him of his renoun,
  Lat him, with ful entencioun,
  His dever doon in ech degree
  That his freend ne shamed be,                     5300
  In this two [cases] with his might,
  Taking no kepe to skile nor right,
  As ferre as love may him excuse;
  This oughte no man to refuse."
  This love that I have told to thee                5305
  Is no-thing contrarie to me;
  This wol I that thou folowe wel,
  And leve the tother everydel.
  This love to vertu al attendith,
  The tothir fooles blent and shendith.             5310
   'Another love also there is,
  That is contrarie unto this,
  Which desyre is so constreyned
  That [it] is but wille feyned;
  Awey fro trouthe it doth so varie,                5315
  That to good love it is contrarie;
  For it maymeth, in many wyse,
  Syke hertis with coveityse;
  Al in winning and in profyt
  Sich love settith his delyt.                      5320
  This love so hangeth in balaunce
  That, if it lese his hope, perchaunce,
  Of lucre, that he is set upon,
  It wol faile, and quenche anon;
  For no man may be amorous,                        5325
  Ne in his living vertuous,
  But-[if] he love more, in mood,
  Men for hem-silf than for hir good.
  For love that profit doth abyde
  Is fals, and bit not in no tyde.                  5330
  [This] love cometh of dame Fortune,
  That litel whyle wol contune;
  For it shal chaungen wonder sone,
  And take eclips right as the mone,
  Whan she is from us [y]-let                       5335
  Thurgh erthe, that bitwixe is set
  The sonne and hir, as it may falle,
  Be it in party, or in alle;
  The shadowe maketh her bemis merke,
  And hir hornes to shewe derke,                    5340
  That part where she hath lost hir lyght
  Of Phebus fully, and the sight;
  Til, whan the shadowe is overpast,
  She is enlumined ageyn as faste,
  Thurgh brightnesse of the sonne bemes             5345
  That yeveth to hir ageyn hir lemes.
  That love is right of sich nature;
  Now is [it] fair, and now obscure.
  Now bright, now clipsy of manere,
  And whylom dim, and whylom clere.                 5350
  As sone as Poverte ginneth take,
  With mantel and [with] wedis blake
  [It] hidith of Love the light awey,
  That into night it turneth day;
  It may not see Richesse shyne                     5355
  Til the blakke shadowes fyne.
  For, whan Richesse shyneth bright,
  Love recovereth ageyn his light;
  And whan it failith, he wol flit,
  And as she [groweth, so groweth] it.              5360
   'Of this love, here what I sey:--
  The riche men are loved ay,
  And namely tho that sparand bene,
  That wol not wasshe hir hertes clene
  Of the filthe, nor of the vyce                    5365
  Of gredy brenning avaryce.
  The riche man ful fond is, y-wis,
  That weneth that he loved is.
  If that his herte it undirstood,
  It is not he, it is his good;                     5370
  He may wel witen in his thought,
  His good is loved, and he right nought.
  For if he be a nigard eke,
  Men wole not sette by him a leke,
  But haten him; this is the soth.                  5375
  Lo, what profit his catel doth!
  Of every man that may him see,
  It geteth him nought but enmitee.
  But he amende him of that vyce,
  And knowe him-silf, he is not wys.                5380
   'Certis, he shulde ay freendly be,
  To gete him love also ben free,
  Or ellis he is not wyse ne sage
  No more than is a gote ramage.
  That he not loveth, his dede  proveth,            5385
  Whan he his richesse so wel loveth,
  That he wol hyde it ay and spare,
  His pore freendis seen forfare;
  To kepe [it ay is] his purpose,
  Til for drede his eyen close,                     5390
  And til a wikked deth him take;
  Him hadde lever asondre shake,
  And late his limes a sondre ryve,
  Than leve his richesse in his lyve.
  He thenkith parte it with no man;                 5395
  Certayn, no love is in him than.
  How shulde love within him be,
  Whan in his herte is no pite?
  That he trespasseth, wel I wat,
  For ech man knowith his estat;                    5400
  For wel him oughte be reproved
  That loveth nought, ne is not loved.
   'But sith we arn to Fortune comen,
  And [han] our sermoun of hir nomen,
  A wondir wil I telle thee now,                    5405
  Thou herdist never sich oon, I trow.
  I not wher thou me leven shal,
  Though sothfastnesse it be [in] al,
  As it is writen, and is sooth,
  That unto men more profit doth                    5410
  The froward Fortune and contraire,
  Than the swote and debonaire:
  And if thee thinke it is doutable,
  It is thurgh argument provable.
  For the debonaire and softe                       5415
  Falsith and bigylith ofte;
  For liche a moder she can cherishe
  And milken as doth a norys;
  And of hir goode to hem deles,
  And yeveth hem part of her loweles,               5420
  With grete richesse and dignitee;
  And hem she hoteth stabilitee
  In a state that is not stable,
  But chaunging ay and variable;
  And fedith hem with glorie veyne,                 5425
  And worldly blisse noncerteyne.
  Whan she hem settith on hir whele,
  Than wene they to be right wele,
  And in so stable state withalle,
  That never they wene for to falle.                5430
  And whan they set so highe be,
  They wene to have in certeintee
  Of hertly frendis [so] gret noumbre,
  That no-thing mighte her stat encombre;
  They truste hem so on every syde,                 5435
  Wening with hem they wolde abyde
  In every perel and mischaunce,
  Withoute chaunge or variaunce,
  Bothe of catel and of good;
  And also for to spende hir blood                  5440
  And alle hir membris for to spille,
  Only to fulfille hir wille.
  They maken it hole in many wyse,
  And hoten hem hir ful servyse,
  How sore that it do hem smerte,                   5445
  Into hir very naked sherte!
  Herte and al, so hole they yeve,
  For the tyme that they may live,
  So that, with her flaterye,
  They maken foolis glorifye                        5450
  Of hir wordis [greet] speking,
  And han [there]-of a reioysing,
  And trowe hem as the Evangyle;
  And it is al falsheed and gyle,
  As they shal afterwardes see,                     5455
  Whan they arn falle in povertee,
  And been of good and catel bare;
  Than shulde they seen who freendis ware.
  For of an hundred, certeynly,
  Nor of a thousand ful scarsly,                    5460
  Ne shal they fynde unnethis oon,
  Whan povertee is comen upon.
  For [this] Fortune that I of telle,
  With men whan hir lust to dwelle,
  Makith hem to lese hir conisaunce,                5465
  And nourishith hem in ignoraunce.
   'But froward Fortune and perverse,
  Whan high estatis she doth reverse,
  And maketh hem to tumble doun
  Of hir whele, with sodeyn tourn,                  5470
  And from hir richesse doth hem flee,
  And plongeth hem in povertee,
  As a stepmoder envyous,
  And leyeth a plastre dolorous
  Unto her hertis, wounded egre,                    5475
  Which is not tempred with vinegre,
  But with poverte and indigence,
  For to shewe, by experience,
  That she is Fortune verely
  In whom no man shulde affy,                       5480
  Nor in hir yeftis have fiaunce,
  She is so ful of variaunce.
  Thus can she maken high and lowe,
  Whan they from richesse ar[e]n throwe,
  Fully to knowen, withouten were,                  5485
  Freend of effect, and freend of chere;
  And which in love weren trew and stable,
  And whiche also weren variable,
  After Fortune, hir goddesse,
  In poverte, outher in richesse;                   5490
  For al [she] yeveth, out of drede,
  Unhappe bereveth it in dede;
  For Infortune lat not oon
  Of freendis, whan Fortune is goon;
  I mene tho freendis that wol flee                 5495
  Anoon as entreth povertee.
  And yit they wol not leve hem so,
  But in ech place where they go
  They calle hem "wrecche," scorne and blame,
  And of hir mishappe hem diffame,                  5500
  And, namely, siche as in richesse
  Pretendith most of stablenesse,
  Whan that they sawe him set onlofte,
  And weren of him socoured ofte,
  And most y-holpe in al hir nede:                  5505
  But now they take no maner hede,
  But seyn, in voice of flaterye,
  That now apperith hir folye,
  Over-al where-so they fare,
  And singe, "Go, farewel feldefare."               5510
  Alle suche freendis I beshrewe,
  For of [the] trewe ther be to fewe;
  But sothfast freendis, what so bityde,
  In every fortune wolen abyde;
  They han hir hertis in suche noblesse             5515
  That they nil love for no richesse;
  Nor, for that Fortune may hem sende,
  They wolen hem socoure and defende;
  And chaunge for softe ne for sore,
  For who is freend, loveth evermore.               5520
  Though men drawe swerd his freend to slo,
  He may not hewe hir love a-two.
  But, in [the] case that I shal sey,
  For pride and ire lese it he may,
  And for reprove by nycetee,                       5525
  And discovering of privitee,
  With tonge wounding, as feloun,
  Thurgh venemous detraccioun.
  Frend in this case wol gon his way,
  For no-thing greve him more ne may;               5530
  And for nought ellis wol he flee,
  If that he love in stabilitee.
  And certeyn, he is wel bigoon
  Among a thousand that fyndith oon.
  For ther may be no richesse,                      5535
  Ageyns frendship, of worthinesse;
  For it ne may so high atteigne
  As may the valoure, sooth to seyne,
  Of him that loveth trew and wel;
  Frendship is more than is catel.                  5540
  For freend in court ay better is
  Than peny in [his] purs, certis;
  And Fortune, mishapping,
  Whan upon men she is [falling],
  Thurgh misturning of hir chaunce,                 5545
  And casteth hem oute of balaunce,
  She makith, thurgh hir adversitee,
  Men ful cleerly for to see
  Him that is freend in existence
  From him that is by apparence.                    5550
  For Infortune makith anoon
  To knowe thy freendis fro thy foon,
  By experience, right as it is;
  The which is more to preyse, y-wis,
  Than [is] miche richesse and tresour;             5555
  For more [doth] profit and valour
  Poverte, and such adversitee,
  Bifore than doth prosperitee;
  For the toon yeveth conisaunce,
  And the tother ignoraunce.                        5560
   'And thus in poverte is in dede
  Trouthe declared fro falsehede;
  For feynte frendis it wol declare,
  And trewe also, what wey they fare.
  For whan he was in his richesse,                  5565
  These freendis, ful of doublenesse,
  Offrid him in many wyse
  Hert and body, and servyse.
  What wolde he than ha [yeve] to ha bought
  To knowen openly her thought,                     5570
  That he now hath so clerly seen?
  The lasse bigyled he sholde have been
  And he hadde than perceyved it,
  But richesse nold not late him wit.
  Wel more avauntage doth him than,                 5575
  Sith that it makith him a wys man,
  The greet mischeef that he [receyveth],
  Than doth richesse that him deceyveth.
  Richesse riche ne makith nought
  Him that on tresour set his thought;              5580
  For richesse stont in suffisaunce
  And no-thing in habundaunce;
  For suffisaunce al-only
  Makith men to live richely.
  For he that hath [but] miches tweyne,             5585
  Ne [more] value in his demeigne,
  Liveth more at ese, and more is riche,
  Than doth he that is [so] chiche,
  And in his bern hath, soth to seyn,
  An hundred [muwis] of whete greyn,                5590
  Though he be chapman or marchaunt,
  And have of golde many besaunt.
  For in the geting he hath such wo,
  And in the keping drede also,
  And set evermore his bisynesse                    5595
  For to encrese, and not to lesse,
  For to augment and multiply.
  And though on hepis [it] lye him by,
  Yit never shal make his richesse
  Asseth unto his gredinesse.                       5600
  But the povre that recchith nought,
  Save of his lyflode, in his thought,
  Which that he getith with his travaile,
  He dredith nought that it shal faile,
  Though he have lytel worldis good,                5605
  Mete and drinke, and esy food,
  Upon his travel and living,
  And also suffisaunt clothing.
  Or if in syknesse that he falle,
  And lothe mete and drink withalle,                5610
  Though he have nought, his mete to by,
  He shal bithinke him hastely,
  To putte him out of al daunger,
  That he of mete hath no mister;
  Or that he may with litel eke                     5615
  Be founden, whyl that he is seke;
  Or that men shul him bere in hast,
  To live, til his syknesse be past,
  To somme maysondewe bisyde;
  He cast nought what shal him bityde.              5620
  He thenkith nought that ever he shal
  Into any syknesse falle.
   'And though it falle, as it may be,
  That al betyme spare shal he
  As mochel as shal to him suffyce,                 5625
  Whyl he is syke in any wyse,
  He doth [it], for that he wol be
  Content with his povertee
  Withoute nede of any man.
  So miche in litel have he can,                    5630
  He is apayed with his fortune;
  And for he nil be importune
  Unto no wight, ne onerous,
  Nor of hir goodes coveitous;
  Therfore he spareth, it may wel been,             5635
  His pore estat for to sustene.
   'Or if him lust not for to spare,
  But suffrith forth, as nought ne ware,
  Atte last it hapneth, as it may,
  Right unto his laste day,                         5640
  And taketh the world as it wolde be;
  For ever in herte thenkith he,
  The soner that [the] deeth him slo,
  To paradys the soner go
  He shal, there for to live in blisse,             5645
  Where that he shal no good misse.
  Thider he hopith god shal him sende
  Aftir his wrecchid lyves ende.
  Pictagoras himsilf reherses,
  In a book that the Golden verses                  5650
  Is clepid, for the nobilitee
  Of the honourable ditee:--
 "Than, whan thou gost thy body fro,
  Free in the eir thou shalt up go,
  And leven al humanitee,                           5655
  And purely live in deitee."--
  He is a fool, withouten were,
  That trowith have his countre here.
 "In erthe is not our countree,"
  That may these clerkis seyn and see               5660
  In Boece of Consolacioun,
  Where it is maked mencioun
  Of our countree pleyn at the eye,
  By teching of philosophye,
  Where lewid men might lere wit,                   5665
  Who-so that wolde translaten it.
  If he be sich that can wel live
  Aftir his rente may him yive,
  And not desyreth more to have,
  That may fro povertee him save:                   5670
  A wys man seide, as we may seen,
  Is no man wrecched, but he it wene,
  Be he king, knight, or ribaud.
  And many a ribaud is mery and baud,
  That swinkith, and berith, bothe day and night,   5675
  Many a burthen of gret might,
  The whiche doth him lasse offense,
  For he suffrith in pacience.
  They laugh and daunce, trippe and singe,
  And ley not up for her living,                    5680
  But in the tavern al dispendith
  The winning that god hem sendith.
  Than goth he, fardels for to bere,
  With as good chere as he dide ere;
  To swinke and traveile he not feynith,            5685
  For for to robben he disdeynith;
  But right anoon, aftir his swinke,
  He goth to tavern for to drinke.
  Alle these ar riche in abundaunce,
  That can thus have suffisaunce                    5690
  Wel more than can an usurere,
  As god wel knowith, withoute were.
  For an usurer, so god me see,
  Shal never for richesse riche bee,
  But evermore pore and indigent,                   5695
  Scarce, and gredy in his entent.
   'For soth it is, whom it displese,
  Ther may no marchaunt live at ese,
  His herte in sich a were is set,
  That it quik brenneth [more] to get,              5700
  Ne never shal [enough have] geten;
  Though he have gold in gerners yeten,
  For to be nedy he dredith sore.
  Wherfore to geten more and more
  He set his herte and his desire;                  5705
  So hote he brennith in the fire
  Of coveitise, that makith him wood
  To purchase other mennes good.
  He undirfongith a gret peyne,
  That undirtakith to drinke up Seyne;              5710
  For the more he drinkith, ay
  The more he leveth, the soth to say.
  [This is the] thurst of fals geting,
  That last ever in coveiting,
  And the anguisshe and distresse                   5715
  With the fire of gredinesse.
  She fighteth with him ay, and stryveth,
  That his herte asondre ryveth;
  Such gredinesse him assaylith,
  That whan he most hath, most he faylith.          5720
    Phisiciens and advocates
  Gon right by the same yates;
  They selle hir science for winning,
  And haunte hir crafte for greet geting.
  Hir winning is of such swetnesse,                 5725
  That if a man falle in sikenesse,
  They are ful glad, for hir encrese;
  For by hir wille, withoute lees,
  Everiche man shulde be seke,
  And though they dye, they set not a leke.         5730
  After, whan they the gold have take,
  Ful litel care for hem they make.
  They wolde that fourty were seke at onis,
  Ye, two hundred, in flesh and bonis,
  And yit two thousand, as I gesse,                 5735
  For to encresen her richesse.
  They wol not worchen, in no wyse,
  But for lucre and coveityse;
  For fysyk ginneth first by _fy_,
  The fysycien also sothely;                        5740
  And sithen it goth fro _fy_ to _sy_;
  To truste on hem, it is foly;
  For they nil, in no maner gree,
  Do right nought for charitee.
   'Eke in the same secte are set                   5745
  Alle tho that prechen for to get
  Worshipes, honour, and richesse.
  Her hertis arn in greet distresse,
  That folk [ne] live not holily.
  But aboven al, specialy,                          5750

  And toward god have no memorie,
  But forth as ypocrites trace,
  And to her soules deth purchace,
  And  outward [shewen]  holynesse,                 5755
  Though they be fulle of cursidnesse.
  Not liche to the apostles twelve,
  They deceyve other and hem-selve;
  Bigyled is the gyler than.
  For preching of a cursed man,                     5760
  Though [it] to other may profyte,
  Himsilf availeth not a myte;
  For oft good predicacioun
  Cometh of evel entencioun.
  To him not vailith his preching,                  5765
  Al helpe he other with his teching;
  For where they good ensaumple take,
  There is he with veynglorie shake.
   'But lat us leven these prechoures,
  And speke of hem that in her toures               5770
  Hepe up her gold, and faste shette,
  And sore theron her herte sette.
  They neither love god, ne drede;
  They kepe more than it is nede,
  And in her bagges sore it binde,                  5775
  Out of the sonne, and of the winde;
  They putte up more than nede ware,
  Whan they seen pore folk forfare,
  For hunger dye, and for cold quake;
  God can wel vengeaunce therof take.               5780
  [Thre] gret mischeves hem assailith,
  And thus in gadring ay travaylith;
  With moche peyne they winne richesse;
  And drede hem holdith in distresse,
  To kepe that they gadre faste;                    5785
  With sorwe they leve it at the laste;
  With sorwe they bothe dye and live,
  That to richesse her hertis yive,
  And in defaute of love it is,
  As it shewith ful wel, y-wis.                     5790
  For if these gredy, the sothe to seyn,
  Loveden, and were loved ageyn,
  And good love regned over-alle,
  Such wikkidnesse ne shulde falle;
  But he shulde yeve that most good had             5795
  To hem that weren in nede bistad,
  And live withoute fals usure,
  For charitee ful clene and pure.
  If they hem yeve to goodnesse,
  Defending hem from ydelnesse,                     5800
  In al this world than pore noon
  We shulde finde, I trowe, not oon.
  But chaunged is this world unstable;
  For love is over-al vendable.
  We see that no man loveth now                     5805
  But for winning and for prow;
  And love is thralled in servage
  Whan it is sold for avauntage;
  Yit wommen wol hir bodies selle;
  Suche soules goth to the devel of helle.'         5810

          FRAGMENT C.

  Whan Love had told hem his entente,
  The baronage to councel wente;
  In many sentences they fille,
  And dyversly they seide hir wille:
  But aftir discord they accorded,                  5815
  And hir accord to Love recorded.
  Sir,' seiden they, 'we been at oon,
  By even accord of everichoon,
  Out-take Richesse al-only,
  That sworen hath ful hauteynly,                   5820
  That she the castel nil assaile,
  Ne smyte a stroke in this bataile,
  With dart, ne mace, spere, ne knyf,
  For man that speketh or bereth the lyf,
  And blameth your empryse, y-wis,                  5825
  And from our hoost departed is,
  (At leeste wey, as in this plyte,)
  So hath she this man in dispyte;
  For she seith he ne loved hir never,
  And therfor she wol hate him ever.                5830
  For he wol gadre no tresore,
  He hath hir wrath for evermore.
  He agilte hir never in other caas,
  Lo, here al hoolly his trespas!
  She seith wel, that this other day                5835
  He asked hir leve to goon the way
  That is clepid To-moche-Yeving,
  And spak ful faire in his praying;
  But whan he prayde hir, pore was he,
  Therfore she warned him the entree.               5840
  Ne yit is he not thriven so
  That he hath geten a peny or two,
  That quitly is his owne in hold.
  Thus hath Richesse us alle told;
  And whan Richesse us this recorded,               5845
  Withouten hir we been accorded.
   'And we finde in our accordaunce,
  That False-Semblant and Abstinaunce,
  With alle the folk of hir bataile,
  Shulle at the hinder gate assayle,                5850
  That Wikkid-Tunge hath in keping,
  With his Normans, fulle of langling.
  And with hem Curtesie and Largesse,
  That shulle shewe hir hardinesse
  To the olde wyf that [kepeth] so harde            5855
  Fair-Welcoming within her warde.
  Than shal Delyte and Wel-Helinge
  Fonde Shame adoun to bringe;
  With al hir hoost, erly and late,
  They shulle assailen [thilke] gate.               5860
  Agaynes Drede shal Hardinesse
  Assayle, and also Sikernesse,
  With al the folk of hir leding,
  That never wist what was fleing.
   'Fraunchyse shal fighte, and eek Pitee,          5865
  With Daunger ful of crueltee.
  Thus is your hoost ordeyned wel;
  Doun shal the castel every del,
  If everiche do his entente,
  So that Venus be presente,                        5870
  Your modir, ful of vassalage,
  That can y-nough of such usage;
  Withouten hir may no wight spede
  This werk, neither for word ne dede.
  Therfore is good ye for hir sende,                5875
  For thurgh hir may this werk amende.'
    _Amour._ 'Lordinges, my modir, the goddesse,
  That is my lady, and my maistresse,
  Nis not [at] al at my willing,
  Ne doth not al my desyring.                       5880
  Yit can she som-tyme doon labour,
  Whan that hir lust, in my socour,
  [Al my nedis] for to acheve,
  But now I thenke hir not to greve.
  My modir is she, and of childhede                 5885
  I bothe worshipe hir, and eek drede;
  For who that dredith sire ne dame
  Shal it abye in body or name.
  And, natheles, yit cunne we
  Sende aftir hir, if nede be;                      5890
  And were she nigh, she comen wolde,
  I trowe that no-thing might hir holde.
   'My modir is of greet prowesse;
  She hath tan many a forteresse,
  That cost hath many a pound er this,              5895
  Ther I nas not present, y-wis;
  And yit men seide it was my dede;
  But I come never in that stede;
  Ne me ne lykith, so mote I thee,
  Such toures take withoute me.                     5900
  For-why me thenketh that, in no wyse,
  It may ben cleped but marchandise.
   'Go bye a courser, blak or whyte,
  And pay therfor; than art thou quyte.
  The marchaunt oweth thee right nought,            5905
  Ne thou him, whan thou [hast] it bought.
  I wol not selling clepe yeving,
  For selling axeth no guerdoning;
  Here lyth no thank, ne no meryte,
  That oon goth from that other al quyte.           5910
  But this selling is not semblable;
  For, whan his hors is in the stable,
  He may it selle ageyn, pardee,
  And winne on it, such hap may be;
  Al may the man not lese, y-wis,                   5915
  For at the leest the skin is his.
  Or elles, if it so bityde
  That he wol kepe his hors to ryde,
  Yit is he lord ay of his hors.
  But thilke chaffare is wel wors,                  5920
  There Venus entremeteth nought;
  For who-so such chaffare hath bought,
  He shal not worchen so wysly,
  That he ne shal lese al outerly
  Bothe his money and his chaffare;                 5925
  But the seller of the ware
  The prys and profit have shal.
  Certeyn, the byer shal lese al;
  For he ne can so dere it bye
  To have lordship and ful maistrye,                5930
  Ne have power to make letting
  Neither for yift ne for preching,
  That of his chaffare, maugre his,
  Another shal have as moche, y-wis,
  If he wol yeve as moche as he,                    5935
  Of what contrey so that he be;
  Or for right nought, so happe may,
  If he can flater hir to hir pay.
  Ben than suche marchaunts wyse?
  No, but fooles in every wyse,                     5940
  Whan they bye such thing wilfully,
  Ther-as they lese her good [fully].
  But natheles, this dar I saye,
  My modir is not wont to paye,
  For she is neither so fool ne nyce,               5945
  To entremete hir of sich vyce.
  But truste wel, he shal paye al,
  That repente of his bargeyn shal,
  Whan Poverte put him in distresse,
  Al were he scoler to Richesse,                    5950
  That is for me in gret yerning,
  Whan she assenteth to my willing.
   'But, [by] my modir seint Venus,
  And by hir fader Saturnus,
  That hir engendrid by his lyf,                    5955
  But not upon his weddid wyf!
  Yit wol I more unto you swere,
  To make this thing the seurere;
  Now by that feith, and that leautee
  I owe to alle my brethren free,                   5960
  Of which ther nis wight under heven
  That can her fadris names neven,
  So dyvers and so many ther be
  That with my modir have be privee!
  Yit wolde I swere, for sikirnesse,                5965
  The pole of helle to my witnesse,
  Now drinke I not this yeer clarree,
  If that I lye, or forsworn be!
  (For of the goddes the usage is,
  That who-so  him forswereth amis,                 5970
  Shal that yeer drinke no clarree).
  Now have I sworn y-nough, pardee;
  If I forswere me, than am I lorn,
  But I wol never be forsworn.
  Sith Richesse hath me failed here,                5975
  She shal abye that trespas dere,
  At leeste wey, but [she] hir arme
  With swerd, or sparth, or gisarme.
  For certes, sith she loveth not me,
  Fro thilke tyme that she may see                  5980
  The castel and the tour to-shake,
  In sory tyme she shal awake.
  If I may grype a riche man,
  I shal so pulle him, if I can,
  That he shal, in a fewe stoundes,                 5985
  Lese alle his markes and his poundes.
  I shal him make his pens outslinge,
  But-[if] they in his gerner springe;
  Our maydens shal eek plukke him so,
  That him shal neden fetheres mo,                  5990
  And make him selle his lond to spende,
  But he the bet cunne him defende.
   'Pore men han maad hir lord of me;
  Although they not so mighty be,
  That they may fede me in delyt,                   5995
  I wol not have hem in despyt.
  No good man hateth hem, as I gesse,
  For chinche and feloun is Richesse,
  That so can chase hem and dispyse,
  And hem defoule in sondry wyse.                   6000
  They loven ful bet, so god me spede,
  Than doth the riche, chinchy grede,
  And been, in good feith, more stable
  And trewer, and more serviable;
  And therfore it suffysith me                      6005
  Hir goode herte, and hir leautee.
  They han on me set al hir thought,
  And therfore I forgete hem nought.
  I wolde hem bringe in greet noblesse,
  If that I were god of Richesse,                   6010
  As I am god of Love, sothly,
  Such routhe upon hir pleynt have I.
  Therfore I must his socour be,
  That peyneth him to serven me;
  For if he deyde for love of this,                 6015
  Than semeth in me no love ther is.'
   'Sir,' seide they, 'sooth is, every del,
  That ye reherce, and we wot wel
  Thilk oth to holde is resonable;
  For it is good and covenable,                     6020
  That ye on riche men han sworn.
  For, sir, this wot we wel biforn;
  If riche men doon you homage,
  That is as fooles doon outrage;
  But ye shul not forsworen be,                     6025
  Ne let therfore to drinke clarree,
  Or piment maked fresh and newe.
  Ladyes shulle hem such pepir brewe,
  If that they falle into hir laas,
  That they for we mowe seyn "Allas!"               6030
  Ladyes shuln ever so curteis be,
  That they shal quyte your oth al free.
  Ne seketh never other vicaire,
  For they shal speke with hem so faire
  That ye shal holde you payed ful wel,             6035
  Though ye you medle never a del.
  Lat ladies worche with hir thinges,
  They shal hem telle so fele tydinges,
  And moeve hem eke so many requestis
  By flatery, that not honest is,                   6040
  And therto yeve hem such thankinges,
  What with kissing, and with talkinges,
  That certes, if they trowed be,
  Shal never leve hem loud ne fee
  That it nil as the moeble fare,                   6045
  Of which they first delivered are.
  Now may ye telle us al your wille,
  And we your hestes shal fulfille.
   'But Fals-Semblant dar not, for drede
  Of you, sir, medle him of this dede,              6050
  For he seith that ye been his fo;
  He not, if ye wol worche him wo.
  Wherfore we pray you alle, beausire,
  That ye forgive him now your ire,
  And that he may dwelle, as your man,              6055
  With Abstinence, his dere lemman;
  This our accord and our wil now.'
   'Parfay,' seide Love, 'I graunte it yow;
  I wol wel holde him for my man;
  Now lat him come:' and he forth ran.              6060
  Fals-Semblant,' quod Love, 'in this wyse
  I take thee here to my servyse,
  That thou our freendis helpe alway,
  And hindre hem neithir night ne day,
  But do thy might hem to releve,                   6065
  And eek our enemies that thou greve.
  Thyn be this might, I graunt it thee,
  My king of harlotes shalt thou be;
  We wol that thou have such honour.
  Certeyn, thou art a fals traitour,                6070
  And eek a theef; sith thou were born,
  A thousand tyme thou art forsworn.
  But, natheles, in our hering,
  To putte our folk out of douting,
  I bid thee teche hem, wostow how?                 6075
  By somme general signe now,
  In what place thou shalt founden be,
  If that men had mister of thee;
  And how men shal thee best espye,
  For thee to knowe is greet maistrye;              6080
  Tel in what place is thyn haunting.'
    _F. Sem._ 'Sir, I have fele dyvers woning,
  That I kepe not rehersed be,
  So that ye wolde respyten me.
  For if that I telle you the sothe,                6085
  I may have harm and shame bothe.
  If that my felowes wisten it,
  My tales shulden me be quit;
  For certeyn, they wolde hate me,
  If ever I knewe hir cruelte;                      6090
  For they wolde over-al holde hem stille
  Of trouthe that is ageyn hir wille;
  Suche tales kepen they not here.
  I might eftsone bye it ful dere,
  If I seide of hem any thing,                      6095
  That ought displeseth to hir hering.
  For what word that hem prikke or byteth,
  In that word noon of hem delyteth,
  Al were it gospel, the evangyle,
  That wolde reprove hem of hir gyle,               6100
  For they are cruel and hauteyn.
  And this thing wot I wel, certeyn,
  If I speke ought to peire hir loos,
  Your court shal not so wel be cloos,
  That they ne shal wite it atte last.              6105
  Of good men am I nought agast,
  For they wol taken on hem nothing,
  Whan that they knowe al my mening;
  But he that wol it on him take,
  He wol himself suspecious make,                   6110
  That he his lyf let covertly,
  In Gyle and in Ipocrisy,
  That me engendred and yaf fostring.'
   'They made a ful good engendring,'
  Quod Love, 'for who-so soothly telle,             6115
  They engendred the devel of helle!
   'But nedely, how-so-ever it be,'
  Quod Love, 'I wol and charge thee,
  To telle anoon thy woning-places,
  Hering ech wight that in this place is:           6120
  And what lyf that thou livest also,
  Hyde it no lenger now; wherto?
  Thou most discover al thy wurching,
  How thou servest, and of what thing,
  Though that thou shuldest for thy soth-sawe       6125
  Ben al to-beten and to-drawe;
  And yit art thou not wont, pardee.
  But natheles, though thou beten be,
  Thou shalt not be the first, that so
  Hath for soth-sawe suffred wo.'                   6130
    _F. Sem._ 'Sir, sith that it may lyken you,
  Though that I shulde be slayn right now,
  I shal don your comaundement,
  For therto have I gret talent.'
    Withouten wordes mo, right than,                6135
  Fals-Semblant his sermon bigan,
  And seide hem thus in audience:--
  Barouns, tak hede of my sentence!
  That wight that list to have knowing
  Of Fals-Semblant, ful of flatering,               6140
  He must in worldly folk him seke,
  And, certes, in the cloistres eke;
  I wone no-where but in hem tweye;
  But not lyk even, sooth to seye;
  Shortly, I wol herberwe me                        6145
  There I hope best to hulstred be;
  And certeynly, sikerest hyding
  Is undirneth humblest clothing.
   'Religious folk ben ful covert;
  Seculer folk ben more appert.                     6150
  But natheles, I wol not blame
  Religious folk, ne hem diffame,
  In what habit that ever they go:
  Religioun humble, and trewe also,
  Wol I not blame, ne dispyse,                      6155
  But I nil love it, in no wyse.
  I mene of fals religious,
  That stoute ben, and malicious;
  That wolen in an abit go,
  And setten not hir herte therto.                  6160
   'Religious folk ben al pitous;
  Thou shalt not seen oon dispitous.
  They loven no pryde, ne no stryf,
  But humbly they wol lede hir lyf;
  With swich folk wol I never be.                   6165
  And if I dwelle, I feyne me
  I may wel in her abit go;
  But me were lever my nekke atwo,
  Than lete a purpose that I take,
  What covenaunt that ever I make.                  6170
  I dwelle with hem that proude be,
  And fulle of wyles and subtelte;
  That worship of this world coveyten,
  And grete nedes cunne espleyten;
  And goon and gadren greet pitaunces,              6175
  And purchace hem the acqueyntaunces
  Of men that mighty lyf may leden;
  And feyne hem pore, and hem-self feden
  With gode morcels delicious,
  And drinken good wyn precious,                    6180
  And preche us povert and distresse,
  And fisshen hem-self greet richesse
  With wyly nettis that they caste:
  It wol come foul out at the laste.
  They ben fro clene religioun went;                6185
  They make the world an argument
  That hath a foul conclusioun.
 "I have a robe of religioun,
  Than am I al religious:"
  This argument is al roignous;                     6190
  It is not worth a croked brere;
  Habit ne maketh monk ne frere,
  But clene lyf and devocioun
  Maketh gode men of religioun.
  Nathelesse, ther can noon answere,                6195
  How high that ever his heed he shere
  With rasour whetted never so kene,
  That Gyle in braunches cut thrittene;
  Ther can no wight distincte it so,
  That he dar sey a word therto.                    6200
   'But what herberwe that ever I take,
  Or what semblant that ever I make,
  I mene but gyle, and folowe that;
  For right no mo than Gibbe our cat
  [Fro myce and rattes went his wyle],              6205
  Ne entende I [not] but to begyle;
  Ne no wight may, by my clothing,
  Wite with what folk is my dwelling;
  Ne by my wordis yet, pardee,
  So softe and so plesaunt they be.                 6210
  Bihold the dedis that I do;
  But thou be blind, thou oughtest so;
  For, varie hir wordis fro hir dede,
  They thenke on gyle, withouten drede,
  What maner clothing that they were,               6215
  Or what estat that ever they bere,
  Lered or lewd, lord or lady,
  Knight, squier, burgeis, or bayly.'
    Right thus whyl Fals-Semblant sermoneth,
  Eftsones Love him aresoneth,                      6220
  And brak his tale in the speking
  As though he had him told lesing;
  And seide: 'What, devel, is that I here?
  What folk hast thou us nempned here?
  May men finde religioun                           6225
  In worldly habitacioun?'
    _F. Sem._ 'Ye, sir; it foloweth not that they
  Shulde lede a wikked lyf, parfey,
  Ne not therfore her soules lese,
  That hem to worldly clothes chese;                6230
  For, certis, it were gret pitee.
  Men may in seculer clothes see
  Florisshen holy religioun.
  Ful many a seynt in feeld and toun,
  With many a virgin glorious,                      6235

  Yit seyntes never-the-les they weren.

  Whan they resseyved martirdom,
  And wonnen heven unto her hoom.
  Good herte makith the gode thought;
  The clothing yeveth ne reveth nought.
  The gode thought and the worching,                6255
  That maketh religioun flowring,
  Ther lyth the good religioun
  Aftir the right entencioun.
   'Who-so toke a wethers skin,

  Yis! never-the-las, as he were wood,

  They wolde him folowe, al wolde he flee.

  Take oon, and make another straunge.
  Now am I knight, now chasteleyn;
  Now prelat, and now chapeleyn;
  Now prest, now clerk, and now forstere;
  Now am I maister, now scolere;                    6330
  Now monk, now chanoun, now baily;
  What-ever mister man am I.
  Now am I prince, now am I page,
  And can by herte every langage.
  Som-tyme am I hoor and old;                       6335

  I take the strawe, and lete the corn;

  I axe no-more but hir abite.
  What wol ye more? in every wyse,

  Wel can I bere me under weed;
  Unlyk is my word to my deed.                      6360
  Thus make I in my trappis falle,

  I may assoile, and I may shryve,
  That no prelat may lette me,                      6365
  Al folk, wher-ever they founde be:
  I noot no prelat may don so,
  But it the pope be, and no mo,

  Now is not this a propre thing?                   6370

  Er any wight his housel took,
  Than have I pryvilegis large,
  That may of moche thing discharge;
  For he may seye right thus, pardee:--
 "Sir Preest, in shrift I telle it thee,            6390
  That he, to whom that I am shriven,
  Hath me assoiled, and me yiven
  Penaunce soothly, for my sinne,
  Which that I fond me gilty inne;
  Ne I ne have never entencioun                     6395
  To make double confessioun,
  Ne reherce eft my shrift to thee;
  O shrift is right y-nough to me.
  This oughte thee suffyce wel,
  Ne be not rebel never-a-del;                      6400
  For certis, though thou haddest it sworn,
  I wot no prest ne prelat born
  That may to shrift eft me constreyne.
  And if they don, I wol me pleyne;
  For I wot where to pleyne wel.                    6405
  Thou shall not streyne me a del,
  Ne enforce me, ne [yit] me trouble,
  To make my confessioun double.
  Ne I have none affeccioun
  To have double absolucioun.                       6410
  The firste is right y-nough to me;
  This latter assoiling quyte I thee.
  I am unbounde; what mayst thou finde
  More of my sinnes me to unbinde?
  For he, that might hath in his hond,              6415
  Of alle my sinnes me unbond.
  And if thou wolt me thus constreyne,
  That me mot nedis on thee pleyne,
  There shal no Iugge imperial,
  Ne bisshop, ne official,                          6420
  Don Iugement on me; for I
  Shal gon and pleyne me openly
  Unto my shrift-fadir newe,
  (That hight not Frere Wolf untrewe!)
  And he shal chevise him for me,                   6425
  For I trowe he can hampre thee.
  But, lord! he wolde be wrooth withalle,
  If men him wolde Frere Wolf calle!
  For he wolde have no pacience,
  But don al cruel vengeaunce!                      6430
  He wolde his might don at the leest,
  [Ne] no-thing spare for goddis heest.
  And, god so wis be my socour,
  But thou yeve me my Saviour
  At Ester, whan it lyketh me,                      6435
  Withoute presing more on thee,
  I wol forth, and to him goon,
  And he shal housel me anoon,
  For I am out of thy grucching;
  I kepe not dele with thee nothing."               6440
  Thus may he shryve him, that forsaketh
  His paroche-prest, and to me taketh.
  And if the prest wol him refuse,
  I am ful redy him to accuse,
  And him punisshe and hampre so,                   6445
  That he his chirche shal forgo.
   'But who-so hath in his feling
  The consequence of such shryving,
  Shal seen that prest may never have might
  To knowe the conscience aright                    6450
  Of him that is under his cure.
  And this ageyns holy scripture,
  That biddeth every herde honeste
  Have verry knowing of his beste.
  But pore folk that goon by strete,                6455
  That have no gold, ne sommes grete,
  Hem wolde I lete to her prelates,
  Or lete hir prestis knowe hir states,
  For to me right nought yeve they.'
  _Amour._ 'And why is it?'
  _F. Sem._           'For they ne may.             6460
  They ben so bare, I take no keep;
  But I wol have the fatte sheep;--
  Lat parish prestis have the lene,

  And if that prelats grucchen it,                  6465
  That oughten wroth be in hir wit,
  To lese her fatte bestes so,
  I shal yeve hem a stroke or two,
  That they shal lesen with [the] force,
  Ye, bothe hir mytre and hir croce.                6470
  Thus Iape I hem, and have do longe,
  My priveleges been so stronge.'
    Fals-Semblant wolde have stinted here,
  But Love ne made him no such chere
  That he was wery of his sawe;                     6475
  But for to make him glad and fawe,
  He seide:--'Tel on more specialy,
  How that thou servest untrewly.
  Tel forth, and shame thee never a del;
  For as thyn abit shewith wel,                     6480
  Thou [semest] an holy heremyte.'
    _F. Sem._ 'Soth is, but I am an ypocryte.'
    _Amour._ 'Thou gost and prechest povertee?'
    _F. Sem._ 'Ye, sir; but richesse hath poustee.'
    _Amour._ 'Thou prechest abstinence also?'       6485
    _F. Sem._ 'Sir, I wol fillen, so mote I go,
  My paunche of gode mete and wyne,
  As shulde a maister of divyne;
  For how that I me pover feyne,
  Yit alle pore folk I disdeyne.                    6490
   'I love bet the acqueyntaunce
  Ten tymes, of the king of Fraunce,
  Than of pore man of mylde mode,
  Though that his soule be also gode.
  For whan I see beggers quaking,                   6495
  Naked on mixens al stinking,
  For hungre crye, and eek for care,
  I entremete not of hir fare.
  They been so pore, and ful of pyne,
  They might not ones yeve me dyne,                 6500
  For they have no-thing but hir lyf;
  What shulde he yeve that likketh his knyf?
  It is but foly to entremete,
  To seke in houndes nest fat mete.
  Let bere hem to the spitel anoon,                 6505
  But, for me, comfort gete they noon.
  But a riche sike usurere
  Wolde I visyte and drawe nere;
  Him wol I comforte and rehete,
  For I hope of his gold to gete.                   6510
  And if that wikked deth him have,
  I wol go with him to his grave.
  And if ther any reprove me,
  Why that I lete the pore be,
  Wostow how I [mot] ascape?                        6515
  I sey, and swere him ful rape,
  That riche men han more tecches
  Of sinne, than han pore wrecches,
  And han of counseil more mister;
  And therfore I wol drawe hem ner.                 6520
  But as gret hurt, it may so be,
  Hath soule in right gret poverte,
  As soul in gret richesse, forsothe,
  Al-be-it that they hurten bothe.
  For richesse and mendicitees                      6525
  Ben cleped two extremitees;
  The mene is cleped suffisaunce,
  Ther lyth of vertu the aboundaunce.
  For Salamon, ful wel I woot,
  In his Parables us wroot,                         6530
  As it is knowe of many a wight,
  In his [thrittethe] chapitre right:
 "God, thou me kepe, for thy poustee,
  Fro richesse and mendicitee;
  For if a riche man him dresse                     6535
  To thenke to moche on [his] richesse,
  His herte on that so fer is set,
  That he his creatour foryet;
  And him, that [begging] wol ay greve,
  How shulde I by his word him leve?                6540
  Unnethe that he nis a micher,
  Forsworn, or elles [god is] lyer."
  Thus seith Salamones sawes;
  Ne we finde writen in no lawes,
  And namely in our Cristen lay--                   6545
  (Who seith "ye," I dar sey "nay")--
  That Crist, ne his apostlis dere,
  Whyl that they walkede in erthe here,
  Were never seen her bred begging,
  For they nolde beggen for nothing.                6550
  And right thus were men wont to teche;
  And in this wyse wolde it preche
  The maistres of divinitee
  Somtyme in Paris the citee.
   'And if men wolde ther-geyn appose               6555
  The naked text, and lete the glose,
  It mighte sone assoiled be;
  For men may wel the sothe see,
  That, parde, they mighte axe a thing
  Pleynly forth, without begging.                   6560
  For they weren goddis herdis dere,
  And cure of soules hadden here,
  They nolde no-thing begge hir fode;
  For aftir Crist was don on rode,
  With [hir] propre hondis they wrought,            6565
  And with travel, and elles nought,
  They wonnen al hir sustenaunce,
  And liveden forth in hir penaunce,
  And the remenaunt [yeve] awey
  To other pore folk alwey.                         6570
  They neither bilden tour ne halle,
  But [leye] in houses smale withalle.
  A mighty man, that can and may,
  Shulde with his honde and body alway
  Winne him his food in laboring,                   6575
  If he ne have rent or sich a thing,
  Although he be religious,
  And god to serven curious.
  Thus mote he don, or do trespas,
  But-if it be in certeyn cas,                      6580
  That I can reherce, if mister be,
  Right wel, whan the tyme I see.
   'Seke the book of Seynt Austin,
  Be it in paper or perchemin,
  There-as he writ of these worchinges,             6585
  Thou shalt seen that non excusinges
  A parfit man ne shulde seke
  By wordis, ne by dedis eke,
  Although he be religious,
  And god to serven curious,                        6590
  That he ne shal, so mote I go,
  With propre hondis and body also,
  Gete his food in laboring,
  If he ne have propretee of thing.
  Yit shulde he selle al his substaunce,            6595
  And with his swink have sustenaunce,
  If he be parfit in bountee.
  Thus han tho bookes tolde me:
  For he that wol gon ydilly,
  And useth it ay besily                            6600
  To haunten other mennes table,
  He is a trechour, ful of fable;
  Ne he ne may, by gode resoun,
  Excuse him by his orisoun.
  For men bihoveth, in som gyse,                    6605
  Som-tyme [leven] goddes servyse
  To gon and purchasen her nede.
  Men mote eten, that is no drede,
  And slepe, and eek do other thing;
  So longe may they leve praying.                   6610
  So may they eek hir prayer blinne,
  While that they werke, hir mete to winne.
  Seynt Austin wol therto accorde,
  In thilke book that I recorde.
  Justinian eek, that made lawes,                   6615
  Hath thus forboden, by olde dawes,
 "No man, up peyne to be deed,
  Mighty of body, to begge his breed,
  If he may swinke, it for to gete;
  Men shulde him rather mayme or bete,              6620
  Or doon of him apert Iustice,
  Than suffren him in such malice."
  They don not wel, so mote I go,
  That taken such almesse so,
  But if they have som privelege,                   6625
  That of the peyne hem wol allege.
  But how that is, can I not see,
  But-if the prince disseyved be;
  Ne I ne wene not, sikerly,
  That they may have it rightfully.                 6630
  But I wol not determyne
  Of princes power, ne defyne,
  Ne by my word comprende, y-wis,
  If it so fer may strecche in this.
  I wol not entremete a del;                        6635
  But I trowe that the book seith wel,
  Who that taketh almesses, that be
  Dewe to folk that men may see
  Lame, feble, wery, and bare,
  Pore, or in such maner care,                      6640
  (That conne winne hem nevermo,
  For they have no power therto),
  He eteth his owne dampning,
  But-if he lye, that made al thing.
  And if ye such a truaunt finde,                   6645
  Chastise him wel, if ye be kinde.
  But they wolde hate you, percas,
  And, if ye fillen in hir laas,
  They wolde eftsones do you scathe,
  If that they mighte, late or rathe;               6650
  For they be not ful pacient,
  That han the world thus foule blent.
  And witeth wel, [wher] that god bad
  The good man selle al that he had,
  And folowe him, and to pore it yive,              6655
  He wolde not therfore that he live
  To serven him in mendience,
  For it was never his sentence;
  But he bad wirken whan that nede is,
  And folwe him in goode dedis.                     6660
  Seynt Poule, that loved al holy chirche,
  He bade thapostles for to wirche,
  And winnen hir lyflode in that wyse,
  And hem defended truaundyse,
  And seide, "Wirketh with your honden;"            6665
  Thus shulde the thing be undirstonden.
  He nolde, y-wis, bidde hem begging,
  Ne sellen gospel, ne preching,
  Lest they berafte, with hir asking,
  Folk of hir catel or of hir thing.                6670
  For in this world is many a man
  That yeveth his good, for he ne can
  Werne it for shame, or elles he
  Wolde of the asker delivered be;
  And, for he him encombreth so,                    6675
  He yeveth him good to late him go:
  But it can him no-thing profyte,
  They lese the yift and the meryte.
  The goode folk, that Poule to preched,
  Profred him ofte, whan he hem teched,             6680
  Som of hir good in charite;
  But therof right no-thing took he;
  But of his hondwerk wolde he gete
  Clothes to wryen him, and his mete."
    _Amour._ 'Tel me than how a man may liven,      6685
  That al his good to pore hath yiven,
  And wol but only bidde his bedis,
  And never with honde laboure his nedis:
  May he do so?'
    _F. Sem._ 'Ye, sir.'
    _Amour._     'And how?'
    _F. Sem._ 'Sir, I wol gladly telle yow:--       6690
  Seynt Austin seith, a man may be
  In houses that han propretee,
  As templers and hospitelers,
  And as these chanouns regulers,
  Or whyte monkes, or these blake--                 6695
  (I wole no mo ensamplis make)--
  And take therof his sustening,
  For therinne lyth no begging;
  But other-weyes not, y-wis,
  [If] Austin gabbeth not of this.                  6700
  And yit ful many a monk laboureth,
  That god in holy chirche honoureth;
  For whan hir swinking is agoon,
  They rede and singe in chirche anoon.
   'And for ther hath ben greet discord,            6705
  As many a wight may bere record,
  Upon the estate of mendience,
  I wol shortly, in your presence,
  Telle how a man may begge at nede,
  That hath not wherwith him to fede,               6710
  Maugre his felones Iangelinges,
  For sothfastnesse wol non hidinges;
  And yit, percas, I may abey,
  That I to yow sothly thus sey.
   'Lo, here the caas especial:                     6715
  If a man be so bestial
  That he of no craft hath science,
  And nought desyreth ignorence,
  Than may he go a-begging yerne,
  Til he som maner craft can lerne,                 6720
  Thurgh which, withoute truaunding,
  He may in trouthe have his living.
  Or if he may don no labour,
  For elde, or syknesse, or langour,
  Or for his tendre age also,                       6725
  Than may he yit a-begging go.
   'Or if he have, peraventure,
  Thurgh usage of his noriture,
  Lived over deliciously,
  Than oughten good folk comunly                    6730
  Han of his mischeef som pitee,
  And suffren him also, that he
  May gon aboute and begge his breed,
  That he be not for hungur deed.
  Or if he have of craft cunning,                   6735
  And strengthe also, and desiring
  To wirken, as he hadde what,
  But he finde neither this ne that,
  Than may he begge, til that he
  Have geten his necessitee.                        6740
   'Or if his winning be so lyte,
  That his labour wol not acquyte
  Sufficiantly al his living,
  Yit may he go his breed begging;
  Fro dore to dore he may go trace,                 6745
  Til he the remenaunt may purchace.
  Or if a man wolde undirtake
  Any empryse for to make,
  In the rescous of our lay,
  And it defenden as he may,                        6750
  Be it with armes or lettrure,
  Or other covenable cure,
  If it be so he pore be,
  Than may he begge, til that he
  May finde in trouthe for to swinke,               6755
  And gete him clothes, mete, and drinke.
  Swinke he with hondis corporel,
  And not with hondis espirituel.
   'In al thise caas, and in semblables,
  If that ther ben mo resonables,                   6760
  He may begge, as I telle you here,
  And elles nought, in no manere;
  As William Seynt Amour wolde preche,
  And ofte wolde dispute and teche
  Of this matere alle openly                        6765
  At Paris ful solempnely.
  And al-so god my soule blesse,
  As he had, in this stedfastnesse,
  The accord of the universitee,
  And of the puple, as semeth me.                   6770
   'No good man oughte it to refuse,
  Ne oughte him therof to excuse,
  Be wrooth or blythe who-so be;
  For I wol speke, and telle it thee,
  Al shulde I dye, and be put doun,                 6775
  As was seynt Poul, in derk prisoun;
  Or be exiled in this caas
  With wrong, as maister William was,
  That my moder Ypocrisye
  Banisshed for hir greet envye.                    6780
   'My moder flemed him, Seynt Amour:
  This noble dide such labour
  To susteyne ever the loyaltee,
  That he to moche agilte me.
  He made a book, and leet it wryte,                6785
  Wherin his lyf he dide al wryte,
  And wolde ich reneyed begging,
  And lived by my traveyling,
  If I ne had rent ne other good.
  What? wened he that I were wood?                  6790
  For labour might me never plese,
  I have more wil to been at ese;
  And have wel lever, sooth to sey,
  Bifore the puple patre and prey,
  And wrye me in my foxerye                         6795
  Under a cope of papelardye.'
    Quod Love, 'What devel is this I here?
  What wordis tellest thou me here?'
    _F. Sem._ 'What, sir?'
    _Amour._             'Falsnesse, that apert is;
  Than dredist thou not god?'
    _F. Sem._             'No, certis:              6800
  For selde in greet thing shal he spede
  In this world, that god wol drede.
  For folk that hem to vertu yiven,
  And truly on her owne liven,
  And hem in goodnesse ay contene,                  6805
  On hem is litel thrift y-sene;
  Such folk drinken gret misese;
  That lyf [ne] may me never plese.
  But see what gold han usurers,
  And silver eek in [hir] garners,                  6810
  Taylagiers, and these monyours,
  Bailifs, bedels, provost, countours;
  These liven wel nygh by ravyne;
  The smale puple hem mote enclyne,
  And they as wolves wol hem eten.                  6815
  Upon the pore folk they geten
  Ful moche of that they spende or kepe;
  Nis none of hem that he nil strepe,
  And wryen him-self wel atte fulle;
  Withoute scalding they hem pulle.                 6820
  The stronge the feble overgoth;
  But I, that were my simple cloth,
  Robbe bothe robbed and robbours,
  And gyle gyled and gylours.
  By my treget, I gadre and threste                 6825
  The greet tresour into my cheste,
  That lyth with me so faste bounde.
  Myn highe paleys do I founde,
  And my delytes I fulfille
  With wyne at feestes at my wille,                 6830
  And tables fulle of entremees;
  I wol no lyf, but ese and pees,
  And winne gold to spende also.
  For whan the grete bagge is go,
  It cometh right with my Iapes.                    6835
  Make I not wel tumble myn apes?
  To winne is alwey myn entent;
  My purchas is better than my rent;
  For though I shulde beten be,
  Over-al I entremete me;                           6840
  Withoute me may no wight dure.
  I walke soules for to cure.
  Of al the worlde cure have I
  In brede and lengthe; boldely
  I wol bothe preche and eek counceilen;            6845
  With hondis wille I not traveilen,
  For of the pope I have the bulle;
  I ne holde not my wittes dulle.
  I wol not stinten, in my lyve,
  These emperouris for to shryve,                   6850
  Or kyngis, dukis, and lordis grete;

  I love no such shryving, pardee,
  But it for other cause be.
  I rekke not of pore men,                          6855
  Hir astate is not worth an hen.
  Where fyndest thou a swinker of labour
  Have me unto his confessour?
  But emperesses, and duchesses,
  Thise quenes, and eek [thise] countesses,         6860
  Thise abbesses, and eek Bigyns,
  These grete ladyes palasyns,
  These Ioly knightes, and baillyves,
  Thise nonnes, and thise burgeis wyves,
  That riche been, and eek plesing,                 6865
  And thise maidens welfaring,
  Wher-so they clad or naked be,
  Uncounceiled goth ther noon fro me.
  And, for her soules savetee,
  At lord and lady, and hir meynee,                 6870
  I axe, whan they hem to me shryve,
  The propretee of al hir lyve,
  And make hem trowe, bothe meest and leest,
  Hir paroch-prest nis but a beest

  And they wolen also tellen me;
  They hele fro me no privitee.
  And for to make yow hem perceyven,
  That usen folk thus to disceyven,
  I wol you seyn, withouten drede,                  6885
  What men may in the gospel rede
  Of Seynt Mathew, the gospelere,
  That seith, as I shal you sey here.
   'Upon the chaire of Moyses--
  Thus is it glosed, douteles:                      6890
  That is the olde testament,

  Sitte Scribes and Pharisen;--
  That is to seyn, the cursid men

  Doth that they preche, I rede you alle,
  But doth not as they don a del,
  That been not wery to seye wel,
  But to do wel, no wille have they;
  And they wolde binde on folk alwey,               6900
  That ben to [be] begyled able,
  Burdens that ben importable;
  On folkes shuldres thinges they couchen
  That they nil with her fingres touchen.'
    _Amour._ 'And why wol they not touche it?'
    _F. Sem._                         'Why?         6905
  For hem ne list not, sikirly;
  For sadde burdens that men taken
  Make folkes shuldres aken.
  And if they do ought that good be,
  That is for folk it shulde see:                   6910
  Her burdens larger maken they,
  And make hir hemmes wyde alwey,
  And loven setes at the table,
  The firste and most honourable;
  And for to han the first chaieris                 6915
  In synagoges, to hem ful dere is;
  And willen that folk hem loute and grete,
  Whan that they passen thurgh the strete,
  And wolen be cleped "Maister" also.
  But they ne shulde not willen so;                 6920
  The gospel is ther-ageyns, I gesse:
  That sheweth wel hir wikkidnesse.
   'Another custom use we:--
  Of hem that wol ayens us be,
  We hate hem deedly everichoon,                    6925
  And we wol werrey hem, as oon.
  Him that oon hatith, hate we alle,
  And coniecte how to doon him falle.
  And if we seen him winne honour,
  Richesse or preys, thurgh his valour,             6930
  Provende, rent, or dignitee,
  Ful fast, y-wis, compassen we
  By what ladder he is clomben so;
  And for to maken him doun to go,
  With traisoun we wole him defame,                 6935
  And doon him lese his gode name.
  Thus from his ladder we him take,
  And thus his freendis foes we make;
  But word ne wite shal he noon,
  Til alle his freendis been his foon.              6940
  For if we dide it openly,
  We might have blame redily;
  For hadde he wist of our malyce,
  He hadde him kept, but he were nyce.
   'Another is this, that, if so falle              6945
  That ther be oon among us alle
  That doth a good turn, out of drede,
  We seyn it is our alder dede.
  Ye, sikerly, though he it feyned,
  Or that him list, or that him deyned              6950
  A man thurgh him avaunced be;
  Therof alle parceners be we,
  And tellen folk, wher-so we go,
  That man thurgh us is sprongen so.
  And for to have of men preysing,                  6955
  We purchace, thurgh our flatering,
  Of riche men, of gret poustee,
  Lettres, to witnesse our bountee;
  So that man weneth, that may us see,
  That alle vertu in us be.                         6960
  And alwey pore we us feyne;
  But how so that we begge or pleyne,
  We ben the folk, without lesing,
  That al thing have without having.
  Thus be we dred of the puple, y-wis.              6965
  And gladly my purpos is this:--
  I dele with no wight, but he
  Have gold and tresour gret plentee;
  Hir acqueyntaunce wel love I;
  This is moche my desyr, shortly.                  6970
  I entremete me of brocages,
  I make pees and mariages,
  I am gladly executour,
  And many tymes procuratour;
  I am somtyme messager;                            6975
  That falleth not to my mister.
  And many tymes I make enquestes;
  For me that office not honest is;
  To dele with other mennes thing,
  That is to me a gret lyking.                      6980
  And if that ye have ought to do
  In place that I repeire to,
  I shal it speden thurgh my wit,
  As sone as ye have told me it.
  So that ye serve me to pay,                       6985
  My servyse shal be your alway.
  But who-so wol chastyse me,
  Anoon my love lost hath he;
  For I love no man in no gyse,
  That wol me repreve or chastyse;                  6990
  But I wolde al folk undirtake,
  And of no wight no teching take;
  For I, that other folk chastye,
  Wol not be taught fro my folye.
   'I love noon hermitage more;                     6995

  And sey that I the world forsake.                 7005

  With luce, with elis, with samons,
  With tendre gees, and with capons,                7040
  With tartes, or with cheses fat,
  With deynte flawnes, brode and flat,
  With caleweys, or with pullaille,
  With coninges, or with fyn vitaille,
  That we, undir our clothes wyde,                  7045
  Maken thurgh our golet glyde:
  Or but he wol do come in haste
  Roo-venisoun, [y]-bake in paste:
  Whether so that he loure or groine,
  He shal have of a corde a loigne,                 7050
  With whiche men shal him binde and lede,
  To brenne him for his sinful dede,
  That men shulle here him crye and rore
  A myle-wey aboute, and more.
  Or elles he shal in prisoun dye,                  7055
  But-if he wol [our] frendship bye,
  Or smerten that that he hath do,
  More than his gilt amounteth to.
  But, and he couthe thurgh his sleight
  Do maken up a tour of height,                     7060
  Nought roughte I whether of stone or tree,
  Or erthe, or turves though it be,
  Though it were of no vounde stone,
  Wrought with squyre and scantilone,
  So that the tour were stuffed wel                 7065
  With alle richesse temporel;
  And thanne, that he wolde updresse
  Engyns, bothe more and lesse,
  To caste at us, by every syde--
  To bere his goode name wyde--                     7070
  Such sleightes [as] I shal yow nevene,
  Barelles of wyne, by sixe or sevene,
  Or gold in sakkes gret plente,
  He shulde sone delivered be.
  And if he have noon sich pitaunces,               7075
  Late him study in equipolences,
  And lete lyes and fallaces,
  If that he wolde deserve our graces;
  Or we shal bere him such witnesse
  Of sinne, and of his wrecchidnesse,               7080
  And doon his loos so wyde renne,
  That al quik we shulde him brenne,
  Or elles yeve him suche penaunce,
  That is wel wors than the pitaunce.
   'For thou shalt never, for nothing,              7085
  Con knowen aright by her clothing
  The traitours fulle of trecherye,
  But thou her werkis can aspye.
  And ne hadde the good keping be
  Whylom of the universitee,                        7090
  That kepeth the key of Cristendome,
  [They] had been turmented, alle and some.
  Suche been the stinking [fals] prophetis;
  Nis non of hem, that good prophete is;
  For they, thurgh wikked entencioun,               7095
  The yeer of the incarnacioun
  A thousand and two hundred yeer,
  Fyve and fifty, ferther ne ner,
  Broughten a book, with sory grace,
  To yeven ensample in comune place,                7100
  That seide thus, though it were fable:--
 "This is the Gospel Perdurable,
  That fro the Holy Goost is sent."
  Wel were it worth to ben [y]-brent.
  Entitled was in such manere                       7105
  This book, of which I telle here.
  Ther nas no wight in al Parys,
  Biforn Our Lady, at parvys,
  That [he] ne mighte bye the book,
  To copy, if him talent took.                      7110
  Ther might he see, by greet tresoun,
  Ful many fais comparisoun:--
 "As moche as, thurgh his grete might,
  Be it of hete, or of light,
  The sunne sourmounteth the mone,                  7115
  That troubler is, and chaungeth sone,
  And the note-kernel the shelle--
  (I scorne nat that I yow telle)--
  Right so, withouten any gyle,
  Sourmounteth this noble Evangyle                  7120
  The word of any evangelist."
  And to her title they token Christ;
  And many such comparisoun,
  Of which I make no mencioun,
  Might men in that boke finde,                     7125
  Who-so coude of hem have minde.
   'The universitee, that tho was aslepe,
  Gan for to braide, and taken kepe;
  And at the noys the heed up-caste,
  Ne never sithen slepte it faste,                  7130
  But up it sterte, and armes took
  Ayens this fals horrible book,
  Al redy bateil for to make,
  And to the Iuge the book to take.
  But they that broughten the book there            7135
  Hente it anoon awey, for fere;
  They nolde shewe it more a del,
  But thenne it kepte, and kepen wil,
  Til such a tyme that they may see
  That they so stronge woxen be,                    7140
  That no wight may hem wel withstonde;
  For by that book they durst not stonde.
  Away they gonne it for to bere,
  For they ne durste not answere
  By exposicioun ne glose                           7145
  To that that clerkis wole appose
  Ayens the cursednesse, y-wis,
  That in that boke writen is.
  Now wot I not, ne I can not see
  What maner ende that there shal be                7150
  Of al this [boke] that they hyde;
  But yit algate they shal abyde
  Til that they may it bet defende;
  This trowe I best, wol be hir ende.
   'Thus Antecrist abyden we,                       7155
  For we ben alle of his meynee;
  And what man that wol not be so,
  Right sone he shal his lyf forgo.
  We wol a puple on him areyse,
  And thurgh our gyle doon him seise,               7160
  And him on sharpe speris ryve,
  Or other-weyes bringe him fro lyve,
  But-if that he wol folowe, y-wis,
  That in our boke writen is.
  Thus moche wol our book signifye,                 7165
  That whyl [that] Peter hath maistrye,
  May never lohan shewe wel his might.
   'Now have I you declared right

  That makith the entenciouns blinde.               7170
  But now at erst I wol biginne
  To expowne you the pith withinne:--
  [And first, by Peter, as I wene,
  The Pope himself we wolden mene]
  And [eek] the seculers comprehende,               7175
  That Cristes lawe wol defende,
  And shulde it kepen and mayntenen

  And falsly to the puple techen.
  [And] Iohan bitokeneth hem [that] prechen,        7180
  That ther nis lawe covenable
  But thilke Gospel Perdurable,
  That fro the Holy Gost was sent
  To turne folk that been miswent.
  The strengthe of Iohan they undirstonde           7185
  The grace in which, they seye, they stonde,
  That doth the sinful folk converte,
  And hem to Iesus Crist reverte.
   'Ful many another horriblete
  May men in that boke see,                         7190
  That ben comaunded, douteles,
  Ayens the lawe of Rome expres;
  And alle with Antecrist they holden,
  As men may in the book biholden.
  And than comaunden they to sleen                  7195
  Alle tho that with Peter been;
  But they shal nevere have that might,
  And, god toforn, for stryf to fight,
  That they ne shal y-nough [men] finde
  That Peters lawe shal have in minde,              7200
  And ever holde, and so mayntene,
  That at the last it shal be sene
  That they shal alle come therto,
  For ought that they can speke or do.

  That they by Iohan have undirstonde;
  But, maugre hem, it shal adoun,
  And been brought to confusioun.
  But I wol stinte of this matere,
  For it is wonder long to here;                    7210
  But hadde that ilke book endured,
  Of better estate I were ensured;
  And freendis have I yit, pardee,

  The sothe dar no wight biwreye.

  He nis no ful good champioun,
  That dredith such similacioun;                    7230
  Nor that for peyne wole refusen

  So clene, as men her clothis demen,               7250

  With sleighe and pale faces lene,
  And greye clothis not ful clene,

  And highe shoes, knopped with dagges,             7260

  That wolde his lyf in honour live.
  And if they be not as they seme,

  There wolde I dwelle, to disceyve
  The folk, for they shal not perceyve.

  That men shulde humble abit dispyse,
  So that no pryde ther-under be.                   7275

  The pore man in sich clothing.
  But god ne preiseth him no-thing,

    The god lough at the wonder tho,                7295
  And every wight gan laughe also,
  And seide:--'Lo here a man aright
  For to be trusty to every wight!'

  For ostages, ne sikirnesse,
  Or chartres, for to bere witnesse.
  I take your-self to record here,
  That men ne may, in no manere,
  Teren the wolf out of his hyde,                   7315
  Til he be [flayn], bak and syde,
  Though men him bete and al defyle;
  What? wene ye that I wole bigyle?
  For I am clothed mekely,
  Ther-under is al my trechery;                     7320
  Myn herte chaungeth never the mo
  For noon abit, in which I go.
  Though I have chere of simplenesse,
  I am not weary of shrewednesse.
  My  lemman,  Streyned-Abstinence,                 7325
  Hath mister of my purveaunce;
  She hadde ful longe ago be deed,
  Nere my councel and my reed;
  Lete hir allone, and you and me.'
    And Love answerde, 'I truste thee               7330
  Withoute borowe, for I wol noon.'
  And Fals-Semblant, the theef, anoon,
  Right in that ilke same place,
  That hadde of tresoun al his face
  Right blak withinne, and whyt withoute,           7335
  Thanketh him, gan on his knees loute.
    Than was ther nought, but 'Every man
  Now to assaut, that sailen can,'
  Quod Love, 'and that ful hardily.'
  Than armed they hem communly                      7340
  Of sich armour as to hem fel.
  Whan they were armed, fers and fel,
  They wente hem forth, alle in a route,
  And set the castel al aboute;
  They wil nought away, for no drede,               7345
  Til it so be that they ben dede,
  Or til they have the castel take.
  And foure batels they gan make,
  And parted hem in foure anoon,
  And toke her way, and forth they goon,            7350
  The foure gates for to assaile,
  Of whiche the kepers wol not faile;
  For they ben neither syke ne dede,
  But hardy folk, and stronge in dede.
    Now wole I seyn the countenaunce                7355
  Of Fals-Semblant, and  Abstinaunce,
  That ben to Wikkid-Tonge went.
  But first they helde her parlement,
  Whether it to done were
  To maken hem  be  knowen there,                   7360
  Or elles walken forth disgysed.
  But at the laste they devysed,
  That they wold goon in tapinage,
  As it were in a pilgrimage,
  Lyk good and holy folk unfeyned.                  7365
  And Dame Abstinence-Streyned
  Took on a robe of camelyne,
  And gan hir graithe as a Begyne.
  A large coverchief of threde
  She  wrapped al aboute  hir hede,                 7370
  But she forgat not hir sautere;
  A peire of bedis eek she here
  Upon a lace, al of whyt threde,
  On which that she hir bedes bede;
  But she ne boughte hem never a del,               7375
  For they were geven her, I wot wel,
  God wot, of a ful holy frere,
  That seide he was hir fader dere,
  To whom she hadde ofter went
  Than any frere of his covent.                     7380
  And he visyted hir also,
  And many a sermoun seide hir to;
  He nolde lette, for man on lyve,
  That he ne wolde hir ofte shryve.
  And with so gret devocion                         7385
  They maden her confession,
  That they had ofte, for the nones,
  Two hedes in one hood at ones.
    Of fair shape I devyse her thee,
  But pale of face somtyme was she;                 7390
  That false traitouresse untrewe
  Was lyk that salowe hors of hewe,
  That in the Apocalips is shewed,
  That signifyeth tho folk beshrewed,
  That been al ful of trecherye,                    7395
  And pale, thurgh hypocrisye;
  For on that hors no colour is,
  But only deed and pale, y-wis.
  Of suche a colour enlangoured
  Was  Abstinence, y-wis, coloured;                 7400
  Of her estat she her repented,
  As her visage represented.
    She had a burdoun al of Thefte,
  That Gyle had yeve her of his yefte;
  And a scrippe of Fainte Distresse,                7405
  That ful was of elengenesse,
  And forth she walked sobrely:
  And False-Semblant saynt, _ie vous die_,
  [Had], as it were for such mistere,
  Don on the cope of a frere,                       7410
  With chere simple, and ful pitous;
  His looking was not disdeinous,
  Ne proud, but meke and ful pesible.
  About his nekke he bar a bible,
  And squierly forth gan he gon;                    7415
  And, for to reste his limmes upon,
  He had of Treson a potente;
  As he were feble, his way he wente.
  But in his sleve he gan to thringe
  A rasour sharp, and wel bytinge,                  7420
  That was forged in a forge,
  Which that men clepen Coupegorge.
    So longe forth hir way they nomen,
  Til they to Wicked-Tonge comen,
  That at his gate was sitting,                     7425
  And saw folk in the way passing.
  The pilgrimes saw he faste by,
  That beren hem ful mekely,
  And humblely they with him mette.
  Dame Abstinence first him grette,                 7430
  And sith him False-Semblant salued,
  And he hem; but he not remued,
  For he ne dredde hem not a-del.
  For when he saw hir faces wel,
  Alway in herte him thoughte so,                   7435
  He shulde knowe hem bothe two;
  For wel he knew Dame Abstinaunce
  But he ne knew not Constreynaunce.
  He knew nat that she was constrayned,
  Ne of her theves lyfe feyned,                     7440
  But wende she com of wil al free;
  But she com in another degree;
  And if of good wil she began,
  That wil was failed her [as] than.
    And Fals-Semblant had he seyn als,              7445
  But he knew nat that he was fals.
  Yet fals was he, but his falsnesse
  Ne coude he not espye, nor gesse;
  For semblant was so slye wrought,
  That falsnesse he ne espyed nought.               7450
  But haddest thou knowen him beforn,
  Thou woldest on a boke have sworn,
  Whan thou him saugh in thilke aray
  That he, that whylom was so gay,
  And of the daunce Ioly Robin,                     7455
  Was tho become a Iacobin.
  But sothely, what so men him calle,
  Freres Prechours been good men alle;
  Hir order wickedly they beren,
  Suche minstrelles if [that] they weren.           7460
  So been Augustins and Cordileres,
  And Carmes, and eek Sakked Freres,
  And alle freres, shodde and bare,
  (Though some of hem ben grete and square)
  Ful holy men, as I hem deme;                      7465
  Everich of hem wolde good man seme.
  But shalt thou never of apparence
  Seen conclude good consequence
  In none argument, y-wis,
  If existence al failed is.                        7470
  For men may finde alway sophyme
  The consequence to envenyme,
  Who-so that hath the subteltee
  The double sentence for to see.
    Whan the pilgrymes commen were                  7475
  To Wicked-Tonge, that dwelled there,
  Hir harneis nigh hem was algate;
  By Wicked-Tonge adoun they sate,
  That bad hem ner him for to come,
  And of tydinges telle him some,                   7480
  And sayde hem:--'What cas maketh yow
  To come into this place now?'
  Sir,' seyde Strained-Abstinaunce,
  We, for to drye our penaunce,
  With hertes pitous and devoute,                   7485
  Are commen, as pilgrimes gon aboute;
  Wel nigh on fote alway we go;
  Ful dusty been our heles two;
  And thus bothe we ben sent
  Thurghout this world that is miswent,             7490
  To yeve ensample, and preche also.
  To fisshen sinful men we go,
  For other fisshing ne fisshe we.
  And, sir, for that charitee,
  As we be wont, herberwe we crave,                 7495
  Your lyf to amende; Crist it save!
  And, so it shulde you nat displese,
  We wolden, if it were your ese,
  A short sermoun unto you seyn.'
  And Wikked-Tonge answerde ageyn,                  7500
  The hous,' quod he, 'such as ye see,
  Shal nat be warned you for me,
  Sey what you list, and I wol here.'
  Graunt mercy, swete sire dere!'
  Quod alderfirst Dame  Abstinence,                 7505
  And thus began she hir sentence:
    _Const. Abstinence._ 'Sir, the first vertue, certeyn,
  The gretest, and most sovereyn
  That may be founde in any man,
  For having, or for wit he can,                    7510
  That is, his tonge to refreyne;
  Therto ought every wight him peyne.
  For it is better stille be
  Than for to speken harm, pardee!
  And he that herkeneth it gladly,                  7515
  He is no good man, sikerly.
  And, sir, aboven al other sinne,
  In that art thou most gilty inne.
  Thou spake a Iape not long ago,
  (And, sir, that was right yvel do)                7520
  Of a yong man that here repaired,
  And never yet this place apaired.
  Thou seydest he awaited nothing
  But to disceyve Fair-Welcoming.
  Ye seyde nothing sooth of that;                   7525
  But, sir, ye lye; I tell you plat;
  He ne cometh no more, ne goth, pardee!
  I trow ye shal him never see.
  Fair-Welcoming in prison is,
  That ofte hath pleyed with you, er this,          7530
  The fairest games that he coude,
  Withoute filthe, stille or loude;
  Now dar [he] nat [him]self solace.
  Ye han also the man do chace,
  That he dar neither come ne go.                   7535
  What meveth you to hate him so
  But properly your wikked thought,
  That many a fals lesing hath thought?
  That meveth your foole eloquence,
  That iangleth ever in audience,                   7540
  And on the folk areyseth blame,
  And doth hem dishonour and shame,
  For thing that may have no preving,
  But lyklinesse, and contriving.
  For I dar seyn, that Reson demeth,                7545
  It is not al sooth thing that semeth,
  And it is sinne to controve
  Thing that is [for] to reprove;
  This wot ye wel; and, sir, therefore
  Ye arn to blame [wel] the more.                   7550
  And, nathelesse, he rekketh lyte;
  He yeveth nat now thereof a myte;
  For if he thoughte harm, parfay,
  He wolde come and gon al day;
  He coude him-selfe nat abstene.                   7555
  Now cometh he nat, and that is sene,
  For he ne taketh of it no cure,
  But-if it be through aventure,
  And lasse than other folk, algate.
  And thou here watchest at the gate,               7560
  With spere in thyne arest alway;
  There muse, musard, al the day.
  Thou wakest night and day for thought;
  Y-wis, thy traveyl is for nought.
  And Ielousye, withouten faile,                    7565
  Shal never quyte thee thy travaile.
  And scathe is, that Fair-Welcoming,
  Withouten any trespassing,
  Shal wrongfully in prison be,
  Ther wepeth and languissheth he.                  7570
  And though thou never yet, y-wis,
  Agiltest man no more but this,
  (Take not a-greef) it were worthy
  To putte thee out of this baily,
  And afterward in prison lye,                      7575
  And fettre thee til that thou dye;
  For thou shalt for this sinne dwelle
  Right in the devils ers of helle,
  But-if that thou repente thee.'
   'Ma fay, thou lyest falsly!' quod he.            7580
  What? welcome with mischaunce now!
  Have I therfore herbered you
  To seye me shame, and eek reprove?
  With sory happe, to your bihove,
  Am I to-day your herbergere!                      7585
  Go, herber you elleswhere than here,
  That han a lyer called me!
  Two tregetours art thou and he,
  That in myn hous do me this shame,
  And for my soth-sawe ye me blame.                 7590
  Is this the sermoun that ye make?
  To alle the develles I me take,
  Or elles, god, thou me confounde!
  But er men diden this castel founde,
  It passeth not ten dayes or twelve,               7595
  But it was told right to my-selve,
  And as they seide, right so tolde I,
  He kiste the Rose privily!
  Thus seide I now, and have seid yore;
  I not wher he dide any more.                      7600
  Why shulde men sey me such a thing,
  If it hadde been gabbing?
  Right so seide I, and wol seye yit;
  I trowe, I lyed not of it;
  And with my bemes I wol blowe                     7605
  To alle neighboris a-rowe,
  How he hath bothe comen and gon.'
    Tho spak Fals-Semblant right anon,
  Al is not gospel, out of doute,
  That men seyn in the toune aboute;                7610
  Ley no deef ere to my speking;
  I swere yow, sir, it is gabbing!
  I trowe ye wot wel certeynly,
  That no man loveth him tenderly
  That seith him harm, if he wot it,                7615
  Al be he never so pore of wit.
  And sooth is also sikerly,
  (This knowe ye, sir, as wel as I),
  That lovers gladly wol visyten
  The places ther hir loves habyten.                7620
  This man you loveth and eek honoureth;
  This man to serve you laboureth;
  And clepeth you his freend so dere,
  And this man maketh you good chere,
  And every-wher that [he] you meteth,              7625
  He you saleweth, and he you greteth.
  He preseth not so ofte, that ye
  Ought of his come encombred be;
  Ther presen other folk on yow
  Ful ofter than [that] he doth now.                7630
  And if his herte him streyned so
  Unto the Rose for to go,
  Ye shulde him seen so ofte nede,
  That ye shulde take him with the dede.
  He coude his coming not forbere,                  7635
  Though ye him thrilled with a spere;
  It nere not thanne as it is now.
  But trusteth wel, I swere it yow,
  That it is clene out of his thought.
  Sir, certes, he ne thenketh it nought;            7640
  No more ne doth Fair-Welcoming,
  That sore abyeth al this thing.
  And if they were of oon assent,
  Ful sone were the Rose hent;
  The maugre youres wolde be.                       7645
  And sir, of o thing herkeneth me:--
  Sith ye this man, that loveth yow,
  Han seid such harm and shame now,
  Witeth wel, if he gessed it,
  Ye may wel demen in your wit,                     7650
  He nolde no-thing love you so,
  Ne callen you his freend also,
  But night and day he [wolde] wake,
  The castel to destroye and take,
  If it were sooth as ye devyse;                    7655
  Or som man in som maner wyse
  Might it warne him everydel,
  Or by him-self perceyven wel;
  For sith he might not come and gon
  As he was whylom wont to don,                     7660
  He might it sone wite and see;
  But now al other-wyse [doth] he.
  Than have [ye], sir, al-outerly
  Deserved helle, and Iolyly
  The deth of helle douteles,                       7665
  That thrallen folk so gilteles.'
    Fals-Semblant proveth so this thing
  That he can noon answering,
  And seeth alwey such apparaunce,
  That nygh he fel in repentaunce,                  7670
  And seide him:--'Sir, it may wel be.
  Semblant, a good man semen ye;
  And, Abstinence, ful wyse ye seme;
  Of o talent you bothe I deme.
  What counceil wole ye to me yeven?'               7675
    _F. Sem._ 'Right here anoon thou shalt be shriven,
  And sey thy sinne withoute more;
  Of this shall thou repente sore;
  For I am preest, and have poustee
  To shryve folk of most dignitee                   7680
  That been, as wyde as world may dure.
  Of al this world I have the cure,
  And that had never yit persoun,
  No vicarie of no maner toun.
  And, god wot, I have of thee                      7685
  A thousand tymes more pitee
  Than hath thy preest parochial,
  Though he thy freend be special.
  I have avauntage, in o wyse,
  That your prelates ben not so wyse                7690
  Ne half so lettred as am I.
  I am licenced boldely
  In divinitee to rede,
  And to confessen, out of drede.
  If ye wol you now confesse,                       7695
  And leve your sinnes more and lesse,
  Without abood, knele doun anon,
  And you shal have absolucion.'                    7698

THE MINOR POEMS.

I. AN A. B. C.

_Incipit carmen secundum ordinem literarum Alphabeti._

  <<
  Almighty and al merciable quene,
  To whom that al this world fleeth for socour,
  To have relees of sinne, sorwe and tene,
  Glorious virgine, of alle floures flour,
  To thee I flee, confounded in erreur!                 5
  Help and releve, thou mighty debonaire,
  Have mercy on my perilous langour!
  Venquisshed me hath my cruel adversaire.

      >>
      A toy du monde le refui,
      Vierge glorieuse, m'en fui
      Tout confus, ne puis miex faire;
      A toy me tien, a toy m'apuy.
      Relieve moy, abatu suy:
      Vaincu m'a mon aversaire.
      Puis qu'en toy ont tous repaire
      Bien me doy vers toy retraire
      Avant que j'aie plus d'annuy.
      N'est pas luite necessaire                       10
      A moy, se tu, debonnayre,
      Ne me sequeurs comme a autrui.


  <<
  Bountee so fix hath in thyn herte his tente,
  That wel I wot thou wolt my socour be,               10
  Thou canst not warne him that, with good entente,
  Axeth thyn help. Thyn herte is ay so free,
  Thou art largesse of pleyn felicitee,
  Haven of refut, of quiete and of reste.
  Lo, how that theves seven chasen me!                 15
  Help, lady bright, er that my ship to-breste!

  Comfort is noon, but in yow, lady dere,
  For lo, my sinne and my confusioun,
  Which oughten not in thy presence appere,
  Han take on me a grevous accioun                     20
  Of verrey right and desperacioun;
  And, as by right, they mighten wel sustene
  That I were worthy my dampnacioun,
  Nere mercy of you, blisful hevene quene.

  Doute is ther noon, thou queen of misericorde,       25
  That thou nart cause of grace and mercy here;
  God vouched sauf thurgh thee with us tacorde.
  For certes, Cristes blisful moder dere,

      >>
      Bien voy que par toy confortes
      Sera mes cuers desconfortes,
      Quer tu es de salu porte.
      Se je me suis mal tresportez
      Par .vij. larrons, pechies mortez,
      Et erre par voie torte,
      Esperance me conforte
      Qui a toy hui me raporte                         20
      A ce que soie deportez.
      Ma povre arme je t'aporte:
      Sauve la: ne vaut que morte;
      En li sont tous biens avortez.

      Contre moy font une accion
      Ma vergoigne et confusion,
      Que devant toy ne doy venir
      Pour ma tres grant transgression.
      Rayson et desperacion
      Contre moy veulent maintenir;                    30
      Mes pour ce que veil plait fenir,
      Devant toy les fes convenir
      En faisant replicacion.
      C'est que je di appartenir
      A toy du tout et convenir
      Pitie et miseracion.

      Dame es de misericorde
      Par qui Diex bien se recorde
      A sa gent estre racorde.
      Par toy vint pes et concorde,                    40

  <<
  Were now the bowe bent in swich manere,
  As it was first, of Iustice and of yre,              30
  The rightful God nolde of no mercy here;
  But thurgh thee han we grace, as we desyre.

  Ever hath myn hope of refut been in thee,
  For heer-biforn ful ofte, in many a wyse,
  Hast thou to misericorde receyved me.                35
  But mercy, lady, at the grete assyse,
  Whan we shul come bifore the hye Iustyse!
  So litel fruit shal thanne in me be founde,
  That, but thou er that day me wel chastyse,
  Of verrey right my werk me wol confounde.            40

  Fleeing, I flee for socour to thy tente
  Me for to hyde from tempest ful of drede,
  Biseching you that ye you not absente,
  Though I be wikke. O help yit at this nede!

      >>
      Et fu pour oster discorde
      L'arc de justice descorde;
      Et pour ce me sui acorde
      Toi mercier et concorde,
      Pour ce que ostas la corde;
      Quar, ainsi com j'ay recorde,
      S'encore fust l'arc encorde
      Compare l'eust ma vie orde.

      En toy ay m'esperance eu
      Quant a merci m'as receu                         50
      Autre foys en mainte guise,
      Du bien qui ou ciel fu creu
      As ravive et repeu
      M'ame qui estoit occise.
      Las! mes quant la grant assise
      Sera, se n'y es assise
      Pour moy mal y seray veu.
      De bien n'ay nulle reprise.
      Las m'en clain quant bien m'avise,
      Souvent en doy dire heu!                         60

      Fuiant m'en viens a ta tente
      Moy mucier pour la tormente
      Qui ou monde me tempeste.
      Pour mon pechie ne t'absente,

  <<
  Al have I been a beste in wille and dede,            45
  Yit, lady, thou me clothe with thy grace.
  Thyn enemy and myn--lady, tak hede,
  Un-to my deth in poynt is me to chace.

  Glorious mayde and moder, which that never
  Were bitter, neither in erthe nor in see,            50
  But ful of swetnesse and of mercy ever,
  Help that my fader be not wroth with me!
  Spek thou, for I ne dar not him y-see.
  So have I doon in erthe, allas ther-whyle!
  That certes, but-if thou my socour be,               55
  To stink eterne he wol my gost exyle.

  He vouched sauf, tel him, as was his wille,
  Bicome a man, to have our alliaunce,
  And with his precious blood he wroot the bille
  Up-on the crois, as general acquitaunce,             60
  To every penitent in ful creaunce;
  And therfor, lady bright, thou for us praye.
  Than shalt thou bothe stinte al his grevaunce,
  And make our foo to failen of his praye.

      >>
      A moy garder met t'entente,
      A mon besoing soiez preste.
      Se lonc temps j'ay este beste
      A ce, Vierge, je m'arreste
      Que de ta grace me sente.
      Si te fais aussi requeste                        70
      Que ta pitie nu me veste,
      Car je n'ay nulle autre rente.

      Glorieuse vierge mere
      Qui a nul onques amere
      Ne fus en terre ne en mer,
      Ta douceur ores m'apere
      Et ne sueffres que mon pere
      De devant li me jecte puer.
      Se devant li tout vuit j'apper,
      Et par moy ne puis eschapper                     80
      Que ma faute ne compere.
      Tu devant li pour moy te per
      En li moustrant que, s'a li per
      Ne sui, si est il mon frere.

      Homme voult par sa plaisance
      Devenir, pour aliance
      Avoir a humain lignage.
      Avec li crut des enfance
      Pitie dont j'ai esperance
      Avoir eu en mon usage.                           90
      Elle fu mise a forage
      Quant au cuer lui vint mesage
      Du cruel fer de la lance.
      Ne puet estre, se sui sage,
      Que je n'en aie avantage,
      Se tu veus et abondance.


  <<
  I wot it wel, thou wolt ben our socour,              65
  Thou art so ful of bountee, in certeyn.
  For, whan a soule falleth in errour,
  Thy pitee goth and haleth him ayeyn.
  Than makest thou his pees with his sovereyn,
  And bringest him out of the crooked strete.          70
  Who-so thee loveth he shal not love in veyn,
  That shal he finde, as he the lyf shal lete.

  Kalenderes enlumined ben they
  That in this world ben lighted with thy name,
  And who-so goth to you the righte wey,               75
  Him thar not drede in soule to be lame.
  Now, queen of comfort, sith thou art that same
  To whom I seche for my medicyne,
  Lat not my foo no more my wounde entame,
  Myn hele in-to thyn hand al I resigne.               80

  Lady, thy sorwe can I not portreye
  Under the cros, ne his grevous penaunce.
  But, for your bothes peynes, I you preye,
  Lat not our alder foo make his bobaunce,

      >>
      Ie ne truis par nulle voie
      Ou mon salut si bien voie
      Com, apres Dieu, en toy le voy;
      Quar quant aucun se desvoie,                    100
      A ce que tost se ravoie,
      De ta pitie li fais convoy.
      Tu li fes lessier son desroy
      Et li refaiz sa pais au roy,
      Et remez en droite voie.
      Moult est donc cil en bon arroy,
      En bon atour, en bon conroy
      Que ta grace si conroie.

      A toy pour leur medicine.
      A moy donc, virge, t'encline,

II. THE COMPLEYNTE UNTO PITE.

  Pite, that I have sought so yore ago,
  With herte sore, and ful of besy peyne,
  That in this world was never wight so wo
  With-oute dethe; and, if I shal not feyne,
  My purpos was, to Pite to compleyne                   5
  Upon the crueltee and tirannye
  Of Love, that for my trouthe doth me dye.

  And when that I, by lengthe of certeyn yeres,
  Had ever in oon a tyme sought to speke,
  To Pite ran I, al bespreynt with teres,              10
  To preyen hir on Crueltee me awreke.
  But, er I might with any worde out-breke,
  Or tellen any of my peynes smerte,
  I fond hir deed, and buried in an herte.

  Adoun I fel, when that I saugh the herse,            15
  Deed as a stoon, whyl that the swogh me laste;
  But up I roos, with colour ful diverse,
  And pitously on hir myn yen caste,
  And ner the corps I gan to presen faste,
  And for the soule I shoop me for to preye;           20
  I nas but lorn; ther nas no more to seye.

  Thus am I slayn, sith that Pite is deed;
  Allas! that day! that ever hit shulde falle!
  What maner man dar now holde up his heed?
  To whom shal any sorwful herte calle?                25
  Now Crueltee hath cast to sleen us alle,
  In ydel hope, folk redelees of peyne--
  Sith she is deed--to whom shul we compleyne?

  But yet encreseth me this wonder newe,
  That no wight woot that she is deed, but I;          30
  So many men as in hir tyme hir knewe,
  And yet she dyed not so sodeynly;
  For I have sought hir ever ful besily
  Sith first I hadde wit or mannes mynde;
  But she was deed, er that I coude hir fynde.         35

  Aboute hir herse ther stoden lustily,
  Withouten any wo, as thoughte me,
  Bountee parfit, wel armed and richely,
  And fresshe Beautee, Lust, and Iolitee,
  Assured Maner, Youthe, and Honestee,                 40
  Wisdom, Estaat, [and] Dreed, and Governaunce,
  Confedred bothe by bonde and alliaunce.

  A compleynt hadde I, writen, in myn hond,
  For to have put to Pite as a bille,
  But whan I al this companye ther fond,               45
  That rather wolden al my cause spille
  Than do me help, I held my pleynte stille;
  For to that folk, withouten any faile,
  Withoute Pite may no bille availe.

  Then leve I al thise virtues, sauf Pite,             50
  Keping the corps, as ye have herd me seyn,
  Confedred alle by bonde of Crueltee,
  And been assented that I shal be sleyn.
  And I have put my compleynt up ageyn;
  For to my foos my bille I dar not shewe,             55
  Theffect of which seith thus, in wordes fewe:--

              _The Bille._

  ? 'Humblest of herte, hyest of reverence,
  Benigne flour, coroune of vertues alle,
  Sheweth unto your rial excellence
  Your servaunt, if I durste me so calle,              60
  His mortal harm, in which he is y-falle,
  And noght al only for his evel fare,
  But for your renoun, as he shal declare.

  Hit stondeth thus: your contraire, Crueltee,
  Allyed is ageynst your regalye                       65
  Under colour of womanly Beautee,
  For men [ne] shuld not knowe hir tirannye,
  With Bountee, Gentilesse, and Curtesye,
  And hath depryved you now of your place
  That hight "Beautee, apertenant to Grace."           70

  For kyndly, by your heritage right,
  Ye been annexed ever unto Bountee;
  And verrayly ye oughte do your might
  To helpe Trouthe in his adversitee.
  Ye been also the coroune of Beautee;                 75
  And certes, if ye wanten in thise tweyne,
  The world is lore; ther nis no more to seyne.

  ? 'Eek what availeth Maner and Gentilesse
  Withoute you, benigne creature?
  Shal Crueltee be your governeresse?                  80
  Allas! what herte may hit longe endure?
  Wherfor, but ye the rather take cure
  To breke that perilous alliaunce,
  Ye sleen hem that ben in your obeisaunce.

 'And further over, if ye suffre this,                 85
  Your renoun is fordo than in a throwe;
  Ther shal no man wite wel what Pite is.
  Allas! that your renoun shuld be so lowe!
  Ye be than fro your heritage y-throwe
  By Crueltee, that occupieth your place;              90
  And we despeired, that seken to your grace.

  Have mercy on me, thou Herenus quene,
  That you have sought so tenderly and yore;
  Let som streem of your light on me be sene
  That love and drede you, ay lenger the more.         95
  For, sothly for to seyne, I bere the sore,
  And, though I be not cunning for to pleyne,
  For goddes love, have mercy on my peyne!

  ? 'My peyne is this, that what so I desire
  That have I not, ne no-thing lyk therto;            100
  And ever set Desire myn herte on fire;
  Eek on that other syde, wher-so I go,
  What maner thing that may encrese wo
  That have I redy, unsoght, everywhere;
  Me [ne] lakketh but my deth, and than my bere.      105

  What nedeth to shewe parcel of my peyne?
  Sith every wo that herte may bethinke
  I suffre, and yet I dar not to you pleyne;
  For wel I woot, al-though I wake or winke,
  Ye rekke not whether I flete or sinke.              110
  But natheles, my trouthe I shal sustene
  Unto my deth, and that shal wel be sene.

  This is to seyne, I wol be youres ever;
  Though ye me slee by Crueltee, your fo,
  Algate my spirit shal never dissever                115
  Fro your servyse, for any peyne or wo.
  Sith ye be deed--allas! that hit is so!--
  Thus for your deth I may wel wepe and pleyne
  With herte sore and ful of besy peyne.'             119

III. THE BOOK OF THE DUCHESSE.

              _The Proem._

  I have gret wonder, by this lighte,
  How that I live, for day ne nighte
  I may nat slepe wel nigh noght;
  I have so many an ydel thoght
  Purely for defaute of slepe,                          5
  That, by my trouthe, I take kepe
  Of no-thing, how hit cometh or goth,
  Ne me nis no-thing leef nor loth.
  Al is y-liche good to me--
  Ioye or sorowe, wherso hit be--                      10
  For I have feling in no-thing,
  But, as it were, a mased thing,
  Alway in point to falle a-doun;
  For [sory] imaginacioun
  Is alway hoolly in my minde.                         15
    And wel ye wite, agaynes kinde
  Hit were to liven in this wyse;
  For nature wolde nat suffyse
  To noon erthely creature
  Not longe tyme to endure                             20
  Withoute slepe, and been in sorwe;
  And I ne may, ne night ne morwe,
  Slepe; and thus melancolye,
  And dreed I have for to dye,
  Defaute of slepe, and hevinesse                      25
  Hath sleyn my spirit of quiknesse,
  That I have lost al lustihede.
  Suche fantasyes ben in myn hede
  So I not what is best to do.
    But men mighte axe me, why so                      30
  I may not slepe, and what me is?
  But natheles, who aske this
  Leseth his asking trewely.
  My-selven can not telle why
  The sooth; but trewely, as I gesse,                  35
  I holde hit be a siknesse
  That I have suffred this eight yere,
  And yet my bote is never the nere;
  For ther is phisicien but oon,
  That may me hele; but that is doon.                  40
  Passe we over until eft;
  That wil not be, moot nede be left;
  Our first matere is good to kepe.
    So whan I saw I might not slepe,
  Til now late, this other night,                      45
  Upon my bedde I sat upright,
  And bad oon reche me a book,
  A romaunce, and he hit me took
  To rede and dryve the night away;
  For me thoghte it better play                        50
  Then playen either at chesse or tables.
    And in this boke were writen fables
  That clerkes hadde, in olde tyme,
  And other poets, put in ryme
  To rede, and for to be in minde                      55
  Whyl men loved the lawe of kinde.
  This book ne spak but of such thinges,
  Of quenes lyves, and of kinges,
  And many othere thinges smale.
  Amonge al this I fond a tale                         60
  That me thoughte a wonder thing.
    This was the tale: Ther was a king
  That highte Seys, and hadde a wyf,
  The beste that mighte bere lyf;
  And this quene highte Alcyone.                       65
  So hit befel, therafter sone,
  This king wolde wenden over see.
  To tellen shortly, whan that he
  Was in the see, thus in this wyse,
  Soche a tempest gan to ryse                          70
  That brak hir mast, and made it falle,
  And clefte hir ship, and dreinte hem alle,
  That never was founden, as it telles,
  Bord ne man, ne nothing elles.
  Right thus this king Seys loste his lyf.             75
    Now for to speken of his wyf:--
  This lady, that was left at home,
  Hath wonder, that the king ne come
  Hoom, for hit was a longe terme.
  Anon her herte gan to erme;                          80
  And for that hir thoughte evermo
  Hit was not wel [he dwelte] so,
  She longed so after the king
  That certes, hit were a pitous thing
  To telle hir hertely sorwful lyf                     85
  That hadde, alas! this noble wyf;
  For him she loved alderbest.
  Anon she sente bothe eest and west
  To seke him, but they founde nought.
   'Alas!' quoth she, 'that I was wrought!             90
  And wher my lord, my love, be deed?
  Certes, I nil never ete breed,
  I make a-vowe to my god here,
  But I mowe of my lorde here!'
  Such sorwe this lady to her took                     95
  That trewely I, which made this book,
  Had swich pite and swich rowthe
  To rede hir sorwe, that, by my trowthe,
  I ferde the worse al the morwe
  After, to thenken on her sorwe.                     100
    So whan [she] coude here no word
  That no man mighte fynde hir lord,
  Ful oft she swouned, and seide 'alas!'
  For sorwe ful nigh wood she was,
  Ne she coude no reed but oon;                       105
  But doun on knees she sat anoon,
  And weep, that pite was to here.
   'A! mercy! swete lady dere!'
  Quod she to Iuno, hir goddesse;
 'Help me out of this distresse,                      110
  And yeve me grace my lord to see
  Sone, or wite wher-so he be,
  Or how he fareth, or in what wyse,
  And I shal make you sacrifyse,
  And hoolly youres become I shal                     115
  With good wil, body, herte, and al;
  And but thou wilt this, lady swete,
  Send me grace to slepe, and mete
  In my slepe som certeyn sweven,
  Wher-through that I may knowen even                 120
  Whether my lord be quik or deed.'
  With that word she heng doun the heed,
  And fil a-swown as cold as ston;
  Hir women caughte her up anon,
  And broghten hir in bed al naked,                   125
  And she, forweped and forwaked,
  Was wery, and thus the dede sleep
  Fil on her, or she toke keep,
  Through Iuno, that had herd hir bone,
  That made hir [for] to slepe sone;                  130
  For as she prayde, so was don,
  In dede; for Iuno, right anon,
  Called thus her messagere
  To do her erande, and he com nere.
  Whan he was come, she bad him thus:                 135
  Go bet,' quod Iuno, 'to Morpheus,
  Thou knowest him wel, the god of sleep;
  Now understond wel, and tak keep.
  Sey thus on my halfe, that he
  Go faste into the grete see,                        140
  And bid him that, on alle thing,
  He take up Seys body the king,
  That lyth ful pale and no-thing rody.
  Bid him crepe into the body,
  Aud do it goon to Alcyone                           145
  The quene, ther she lyth alone,
  And shewe hir shortly, hit is no nay,
  How hit was dreynt this other day;
  And do the body speke so
  Right as hit was wont to do,                        150
  The whyles that hit was on lyve.
  Go now faste, and hy thee blyve!'
    This messager took leve and wente
  Upon his wey, and never ne stente
  Til he com to the derke valeye                      155
  That stant bytwene roches tweye
  Ther never yet grew corn ne gras,
  Ne tree, ne nothing that ought was,
  Beste, ne man, ne nothing elles,
  Save ther were a fewe welles                        160
  Came renning fro the cliffes adoun,
  That made a deedly sleping soun,
  And ronnen doun right by a cave
  That was under a rokke y-grave
  Amid the valey, wonder depe.                        165
  Ther thise goddes laye and slepe,
  Morpheus, and Eclympasteyre,
  That was the god of slepes heyre,
  That slepe and did non other werk.
    This cave was also as derk                        170
  As helle pit over-al aboute;
  They had good leyser for to route
  To envye, who might slepe beste;
  Some henge hir chin upon hir breste
  And slepe upright, hir heed y-hed,                  175
  And some laye naked in hir bed,
  And slepe whyles the dayes laste.
    This messager com flying faste,
  And cryed, 'O ho! awak anon!'
  Hit was for noght; ther herde him non.              180
  Awak!' quod he, 'who is, lyth there?'
  And blew his horn right in hir ere,
  And cryed 'awaketh!' wonder hye.
  This god of slepe, with his oon ye
  Cast up, axed, 'who clepeth there?'                 185
  Hit am I,' quod this messagere;
  Iuno bad thou shuldest goon'--
  And tolde him what he shulde doon
  As I have told yow here-tofore;
  Hit is no need reherse hit more;                    190
  And wente his wey, whan he had sayd.
    Anon this god of slepe a-brayd
  Out of his slepe, and gan to goon,
  And did as he had bede him doon;
  Took up the dreynte body sone,                      195
  And bar hit forth to Alcyone,
  His wyf the quene, ther-as she lay,
  Right even a quarter before day,
  And stood right at hir beddes fete,
  And called hir, right as she hete,                  200
  By name, and seyde, 'my swete wyf,
  Awak! let be your sorwful lyf!
  For in your sorwe ther lyth no reed;
  For certes, swete, I nam but deed;
  Ye shul me never on lyve y-see.                     205
  But good swete herte, [look] that ye
  Bury my body, [at whiche] a tyde
  Ye mowe hit finde the see besyde;
  And far-wel, swete, my worldes blisse!
  I praye god your sorwe lisse;                       210
  To litel whyl our blisse lasteth!'
    With that hir eyen up she casteth,
  And saw noght; '[A]!' quod she, 'for sorwe!'
  And deyed within the thridde morwe.
  But what she sayde more in that swow                215
  I may not telle yow as now,
  Hit were to longe for to dwelle;
  My first matere I wil yow telle,
  Wherfor I have told this thing
  Of Alcione and Seys the king.                       220
    For thus moche dar I saye wel,
  I had be dolven everydel,
  And deed, right through defaute of sleep,
  If I nad red and taken keep
  Of this tale next before:                           225
  And I wol telle yow wherfore;
  For I ne might, for bote ne bale,
  Slepe, or I had red this tale
  Of this dreynte Seys the king,
  And of the goddes of sleping.                       230
  Whan I had red this tale wel,
  And over-loked hit everydel,
  Me thoughte wonder if hit were so;
  For I had never herd speke, or tho,
  Of no goddes that coude make                        235
  Men [for] to slepe, ne for to wake;
  For I ne knew never god but oon.
  And in my game I sayde anoon--
  And yet me list right evel to pleye--
 'Rather then that I shulde deye                      240
  Through defaute of sleping thus,
  I wolde yive thilke Morpheus,
  Or his goddesse, dame Iuno,
  Or som wight elles, I ne roghte who--
  To make me slepe and have som reste--               245
  I wil yive him the alder-beste
  Yift that ever he abood his lyve,
  And here on warde, right now, as blyve;
  If he wol make me slepe a lyte,
  Of downe of pure dowves whyte                       250
  I wil yive him a fether-bed,
  Rayed with golde, and right wel cled
  In fyn blak satin doutremere,
  And many a pilow, and every bere
  Of clothe of Reynes, to slepe softe;                255
  Him thar not nede to turnen ofte.
  And I wol yive him al that falles
  To a chambre; and al his halles
  I wol do peynte with pure golde,
  And tapite hem ful many folde                       260
  Of oo sute; this shal he have,
  If I wiste wher were his cave,
  If he can make me slepe sone,
  As did the goddesse Alcione.
  And thus this ilke god, Morpheus,                   265
  May winne of me mo fees thus
  Than ever he wan; and to Iuno,
  That is his goddesse, I shal so do,
  I trow that she shal holde her payd.'
    I hadde unneth that word y-sayd                   270
  Right thus as I have told hit yow,
  That sodeynly, I niste how,
  Swich a lust anoon me took
  To slepe, that right upon my book
  I fil aslepe, and therwith even                     275
  Me mette so inly swete a sweven,
  So wonderful, that never yit
  I trowe no man hadde the wit
  To conne wel my sweven rede;
  No, not Ioseph, withoute drede,                     280
  Of Egipte, he that redde so
  The kinges meting Pharao,
  No more than coude the leste of us;
  Ne nat scarsly Macrobeus,
  (He that wroot al thavisioun                        285
  That he mette, king Scipioun,
  The noble man, the Affrican--
  Swiche mervayles fortuned than)
  I trowe, a-rede my dremes even.
  Lo, thus hit was, this was my sweven.               290

              _The Dream._

  Me thoughte thus:--that hit was May,
  And in the dawning ther I lay,
  Me mette thus, in my bed al naked:--
  [I] loked forth, for I was waked
  With smale foules a gret hepe,                      295
  That had affrayed me out of slepe
  Through noyse and swetnesse of hir song;
  And, as me mette, they sate among,
  Upon my chambre-roof withoute,
  Upon the tyles, al a-boute,                         300
  And songen, everich in his wyse,
  The moste solempne servyse
  By note, that ever man, I trowe,
  Had herd; for som of hem song lowe,
  Som hye, and al of oon acorde.                      305
  To telle shortly, at oo worde,
  Was never y-herd so swete a steven,
  But hit had be a thing of heven;--
  So mery a soun, so swete entunes,
  That certes, for the toune of Tewnes,               310
  I nolde but I had herd hem singe,
  For al my chambre gan to ringe
  Through singing of hir armonye.
  For instrument nor melodye
  Was nowher herd yet half so swete,                  315
  Nor of acorde half so mete;
  For ther was noon of hem that feyned
  To singe, for ech of hem him peyned
  To finde out mery crafty notes;
  They ne spared not hir throtes.                     320
  And, sooth to seyn, my chambre was
  Ful wel depeynted, and with glas
  Were al the windowes wel y-glased,
  Ful clere, and nat an hole y-crased,
  That to beholde hit was gret Ioye.                  325
  For hoolly al the storie of Troye
  Was in the glasing y-wroght thus,
  Of Ector and king Priamus,
  Of Achilles and Lamedon,
  Of Medea and of Iason,                              330
  Of Paris, Eleyne, and Lavyne.
  And alle the walles with colours fyne
  Were peynted, bothe text and glose,
  [Of] al the Romaunce of the Rose.
  My windowes weren shet echon,                       335
  And through the glas the sunne shon
  Upon my bed with brighte bemes,
  With many glade gilden stremes;
  And eek the welken was so fair,
  Blew, bright, clere was the air,                    340
  And ful atempre, for sothe, hit was;
  For nother cold nor hoot hit nas,
  Ne in al the welken was a cloude.
    And as I lay thus, wonder loude
  Me thoughte I herde an hunte blowe                  345
  Tassaye his horn, and for to knowe
  Whether hit were clere or hors of soune.
    I herde goinge, up and doune,
  Men, hors, houndes, and other thing;
  And al men speken of hunting,                       350
  How they wolde slee the hert with strengthe,
  And how the hert had, upon lengthe,
  So moche embosed, I not now what.
  Anon-right, whan I herde that,
  How that they wolde on hunting goon,                355
  I was right glad, and up anoon;
  [I] took my hors, and forth I wente
  Out of my chambre; I never stente
  Til I com to the feld withoute.
  Ther overtook I a gret route                        360
  Of huntes and eek of foresteres,
  With many relayes and lymeres,
  And hyed hem to the forest faste,
  And I with hem;--so at the laste
  I asked oon, ladde a lymere:--                      365
  Say, felow, who shal hunten here
  Quod I; and he answerde ageyn,
  Sir, themperour Octovien,'
  Quod he, 'and is heer faste by.'
 'A goddes halfe, in good tyme,' quod I,              370
  Go we faste!' and gan to ryde.
  Whan we came to the forest-syde,
  Every man dide, right anoon,
  As to hunting fil to doon.
  The mayster-hunte anoon, fot-hoot,                  375
  With a gret horne blew three moot
  At the uncoupling of his houndes.
  Within a whyl the hert [y]-founde is,
  Y-halowed, and rechased faste
  Longe tyme; and at the laste,                       380
  This hert rused and stal away
  Fro alle the houndes a prevy way.
  The houndes had overshote hem alle,
  And were on a defaute y-falle;
  Therwith the hunte wonder faste                     385
  Blew a forloyn at the laste.
    I was go walked fro my tree,
  And as I wente, ther cam by me
  A whelp, that fauned me as I stood,
  That hadde y-folowed, and coude no good.            390
  Hit com and creep to me as lowe,
  Right as hit hadde me y-knowe,
  Hild doun his heed and Ioyned his eres,
  And leyde al smothe doun his heres.
  I wolde han caught hit, and anoon                   395
  Hit fledde, and was fro me goon;
  And I him folwed, and hit forth wente
  Doun by a floury grene wente
  Ful thikke of gras, ful softe and swete,
  With floures fele, faire under fete,                400
  And litel used, hit seemed thus;
  For bothe Flora and Zephirus,
  They two that make floures growe,
  Had mad hir dwelling ther, I trowe;
  For hit was, on to beholde,                         405
  As thogh the erthe envye wolde
  To be gayer than the heven,
  To have mo floures, swiche seven
  As in the welken sterres be.
  Hit had forgete the povertee                        410
  That winter, through his colde morwes,
  Had mad hit suffren, and his sorwes;
  Al was forgeten, and that was sene.
  For al the wode was waxen grene,
  Swetnesse of dewe had mad it waxe.                  415
    Hit is no need eek for to axe
  Wher ther were many grene greves,
  Or thikke of trees, so ful of leves;
  And every tree stood by him-selve
  Fro other wel ten foot or twelve.                   420
  So grete trees, so huge of strengthe,
  Of fourty or fifty fadme lengthe,
  Clene withoute bough or stikke,
  With croppes brode, and eek as thikke--
  They were nat an inche a-sonder--                   425
  That hit was shadwe over-al under;
  And many an hert and many an hinde
  Was both before me and bihinde.
  Of founes, soures, bukkes, does
  Was ful the wode, and many roes,                    430
  And many squirelles, that sete
  Ful hye upon the trees, and ete,
  And in hir maner made festes.
  Shortly, hit was so ful of bestes,
  That thogh Argus, the noble countour,               435
  Sete to rekene in his countour,
  And rekened with his figures ten--
  For by tho figures mowe al ken,
  If they be crafty, rekene and noumbre,
  And telle of every thing the noumbre--              440
  Yet shulde he fayle to rekene even
  The wondres, me mette in my sweven.
    But forth they romed wonder faste
  Doun the wode; so at the laste
  I was war of a man in blak,                         445
  That sat and had y-turned his bak
  To an oke, an huge tree.
  Lord,' thoghte I, 'who may that be?
  What ayleth him to sitten here?'
  Anoon-right I wente nere;                           450
  Than fond I sitte even upright
  A wonder wel-faringe knight--
  By the maner me thoughte so--
  Of good mochel, and yong therto,
  Of the age of four and twenty yeer.                 455
  Upon his berde but litel heer,
  And he was clothed al in blakke.
  I stalked even unto his bakke,
  And ther I stood as stille as ought,
  That, sooth to saye, he saw me nought,              460
  For-why he heng his heed adoune.
  And with a deedly sorwful soune
  He made of ryme ten vers or twelve,
  Of a compleynt to him-selve,
  The moste pite, the moste rowthe,                   465
  That ever I herde; for, by my trowthe,
  Hit was gret wonder that nature
  Might suffren any creature
  To have swich sorwe, and be not deed.
  Ful pitous, pale, and nothing reed,                 470
  He sayde a lay, a maner song,
  Withoute note, withoute song,
  And hit was this; for wel I can
  Reherse hit; right thus hit began.--
  ? 'I have of sorwe so gret woon,                    475
  That Ioye gete I never noon,
    Now that I see my lady bright,
    Which I have loved with al my might,
  Is fro me deed, and is a-goon.                      479
  ? Allas, [o] deeth! what ayleth thee,               481
  That thou noldest have taken me,
    Whan that thou toke my lady swete?
  That was so fayr, so fresh, so free,
  So good, that men may wel [y]-see                   485
    Of al goodnesse she had no mete!'--
  Whan he had mad thus his complaynte,
  His sorowful herte gan faste faynte,
  And his spirites wexen dede;
  The blood was fled, for pure drede,                 490
  Doun to his herte, to make him warm--
  For wel hit feled the herte had harm--
  To wite eek why hit was a-drad
  By kinde, and for to make hit glad;
  For hit is membre principal                         495
  Of the body; and that made al
  His hewe chaunge and wexe grene
  And pale, for no blood [was] sene
  In no maner lime of his.
    Anoon therwith whan I saw this,                   500
  He ferde thus evel ther he sete,
  I wente and stood right at his fete,
  And grette him, but he spak noght,
  But argued with his owne thoght,
  And in his witte disputed faste                     505
  Why and how his lyf might laste;
  Him thoughte his sorwes were so smerte
  And lay so colde upon his herte;
  So, through his sorwe and hevy thoght,
  Made him that he ne herde me noght;                 510
  For he had wel nigh lost his minde,
  Thogh Pan, that men clepe god of kinde,
  Were for his sorwes never so wrooth.
    But at the laste, to sayn right sooth,
  He was war of me, how I stood                       515
  Before him, and dide of myn hood,
  And [grette] him, as I best coude.
  Debonairly, and no-thing loude,
  He sayde, 'I prey thee, be not wrooth,
  I herde thee not, to sayn the sooth,                520
  Ne I saw thee not, sir, trewely.'
   'A! goode sir, no fors,' quod I,
  I am right sory if I have ought
  Destroubled yow out of your thought;
  For-yive me if I have mis-take.'                    525
   'Yis, thamendes is light to make,'
  Quod he, 'for ther lyth noon ther-to;
  Ther is no-thing missayd nor do.'
    Lo! how goodly spak this knight,
  As it had been another wight;                       530
  He made it nouther tough ne queynte
  And I saw that, and gan me aqueynte
  With him, and fond him so tretable,
  Right wonder skilful and resonable,
  As me thoghte, for al his bale.                     535
  Anoon-right I gan finde a tale
  To him, to loke wher I might ought
  Have more knowing of his thought.
   'Sir,' quod I, 'this game is doon;
  I holde that this hert be goon;                     540
  Thise huntes conne him nowher see.'
   'I do no fors therof,' quod he,
  My thought is ther-on never a del.'
   'By our lord,' quod I, 'I trow yow wel,
  Right so me thinketh by your chere.                 545
  But, sir, oo thing wol ye here?
  Me thinketh, in gret sorwe I yow see;
  But certes, [good] sir, yif that ye
  Wolde ought discure me your wo,
  I wolde, as wis god helpe me so,                    550
  Amende hit, yif I can or may;
  Ye mowe preve hit by assay.
  For, by my trouthe, to make yow hool,
  I wol do al my power hool;
  And telleth me of your sorwes smerte,               555
  Paraventure hit may ese your herte,
  That semeth ful seke under your syde.'
    With that he loked on me asyde,
  As who sayth, 'nay, that wol not be.'
 'Graunt mercy, goode frend,' quod he,                560
  I thanke thee that thou woldest so,
  But hit may never the rather be do.
  No man may my sorwe glade,
  That maketh my hewe to falle and fade,
  And hath myn understonding lorn,                    565
  That me is wo that I was born!
  May noght make my sorwes slyde,
  Nought the remedies of Ovyde;
  Ne Orpheus, god of melodye,
  Ne Dedalus, with playes slye;                       570
  Ne hele me may phisicien,
  Noght Ypocras, ne Galien;
  Me is wo that I live houres twelve;
  But who so wol assaye him-selve
  Whether his herte can have pite                     575
  Of any sorwe, lat him see me.
  I wrecche, that deeth hath mad al naked
  Of alle blisse that was ever maked,
  Y-worthe worste of alle wightes,
  That hate my dayes and my nightes;                  580
  My lyf, my lustes be me lothe,
  For al welfare and I be wrothe.
  The pure deeth is so my fo,
  [Thogh] I wolde deye, hit wolde not so;
  For whan I folwe hit, hit wol flee;                 585
  I wolde have [hit], hit nil not me.
  This is my peyne withoute reed,
  Alway deying, and be not deed,
  That Sesiphus, that lyth in helle,
  May not of more sorwe telle.                        590
  And who so wiste al, by my trouthe,
  My sorwe, but he hadde routhe
  And pite of my sorwes smerte,
  That man hath a feendly herte.
  For who so seeth me first on morwe                  595
  May seyn, he hath [y]-met with sorwe;
  For I am sorwe and sorwe is I.
   'Allas! and I wol telle the why;
  My [song] is turned to pleyning,
  And al my laughter to weping,                       600
  My glade thoghtes to hevinesse,
  In travaile is myn ydelnesse
  And eek my reste; my wele is wo.
  My good is harm, and ever-mo
  In wrathe is turned my pleying,                     605
  And my delyt in-to sorwing.
  Myn hele is turned into seeknesse,
  In drede is al my sikernesse.
  To derke is turned al my light,
  My wit is foly, my day is night,                    610
  My love is hate, my sleep waking,
  My mirthe and meles is fasting,
  My countenaunce is nycete,
  And al abaved wher-so I be,
  My pees, in pleding and in werre;                   615
  Allas! how mighte I fare werre?
   'My boldnesse is turned to shame,
  For fals Fortune hath pleyd a game
  Atte ches with me, allas! the whyle!
  The trayteresse fals and ful of gyle,               620
  That al behoteth and no-thing halt,
  She goth upryght and yet she halt,
  That baggeth foule and loketh faire,
  The dispitouse debonaire,
  That scorneth many a creature!                      625
  An ydole of fals portraiture
  Is she, for she wil sone wryen;
  She is the monstres heed y-wryen,
  As filth over y-strawed with floures;
  Hir moste worship and hir [flour is]                630
  To lyen, for that is hir nature;
  Withoute feyth, lawe, or mesure
  She is fals; and ever laughinge
  With oon eye, and that other wepinge.
  That is broght up, she set al doun.                 635
  I lykne hir to the scorpioun,
  That is a fals flatering beste;
  For with his hede he maketh feste,
  But al amid his flateringe
  With his tayle he wol stinge,                       640
  And envenyme; and so wol she.
  She is thenvyous charite
  That is ay fals, and semeth wele,
  So turneth she hir false whele
  Aboute, for it is no-thing stable,                  645
  Now by the fyre, now at table;
  Ful many oon hath she thus y-blent.
  She is pley of enchauntement,
  That semeth oon and is nat so,
  The false theef! what hath she do,                  650
  Trowest thou? by our lord, I wol thee seye.
  Atte ches with me she gan to pleye;
  With hir false draughtes divers
  She stal on me, and took my fers.
  And whan I saw my fers aweye,                       655
  Alas! I couthe no lenger pleye,
  But seyde, "farwel, swete, y-wis,
  And farwel al that ever ther is!"
  Therwith Fortune seyde "chek here!"
  And "mate!" in mid pointe of the chekkere           660
  With a poune erraunt, allas!
  Ful craftier to pley she was
  Than Athalus, that made the game
  First of the ches: so was his name.
  But god wolde I had ones or twyes                   665
  Y-koud and knowe the Ieupardyes
  That coude the Grek Pithagores!
  I shulde have pleyd the bet at ches,
  And kept my fers the bet therby;
  And thogh wherto? for trewely                       670
  I hold that wish nat worth a stree!
  Hit had be never the bet for me.
  For Fortune can so many a wyle,
  Ther be but fewe can hir begyle,
  And eek she is the las to blame;                    675
  My-self I wolde have do the same,
  Before god, hadde I been as she;
  She oghte the more excused be.
  For this I say yet more therto,
  Hadde I be god and mighte have do                   680
  My wille, whan my fers she caughte,
  I wolde have drawe the same draughte.
  For, also wis god yive me reste,
  I dar wel swere she took the beste!
   'But through that draughte I have lorn             685
  My blisse; allas! that I was born!
  For evermore, I trowe trewly,
  For al my wil, my lust hoolly
  Is turned; but yet, what to done?
  By our lord, hit is to deye sone;                   690
  For no-thing I [ne] leve it noght,
  But live and deye right in this thoght.
  Ther nis planete in firmament,
  Ne in air, ne in erthe, noon element,
  That they ne yive me a yift echoon                  695
  Of weping, whan I am aloon.
  For whan that I avyse me wel,
  And bethenke me every-del,
  How that ther lyth in rekening,
  In my sorwe, for no-thing;                          700
  And how ther leveth no gladnesse
  May gladde me of my distresse,
  And how I have lost suffisance,
  And therto I have no plesance,
  Than may I say, I have right noght.                 705
  And whan al this falleth in my thoght,
  Allas! than am I overcome!
  For that is doon is not to come!
  I have more sorowe than Tantale.'
    And whan I herde him telle this tale              710
  Thus pitously, as I yow telle,
  Unnethe mighte I lenger dwelle,
  Hit dide myn herte so moche wo.
   'A! good sir!' quod I, 'say not so!
  Have som pite on your nature                        715
  That formed yow to creature,
  Remembre yow of Socrates;
  For he ne counted nat three strees
  Of noght that Fortune coude do.'
   'No,' quod he, 'I can not so.'                     720
   'Why so? good sir! parde!' quod I;
  Ne say noght so, for trewely,
  Thogh ye had lost the ferses twelve,
  And ye for sorwe mordred your-selve,
  Ye sholde be dampned in this cas                    725
  By as good right as Medea was,
  That slow hir children for Iason;
  And Phyllis als for Demophon
  Heng hir-self, so weylaway!
  For he had broke his terme-day                      730
  To come to hir. Another rage
  Had Dydo, quene eek of Cartage,
  That slow hir-self, for Eneas
  Was fals; [a!] whiche a fool she was!
  And Ecquo dyed for Narcisus                         735
  Nolde nat love hir; and right thus
  Hath many another foly don.
  And for Dalida dyed Sampson,
  That slow him-self with a pilere.
  But ther is [noon] a-lyve here                      740
  Wolde for a fers make this wo!'
   'Why so?' quod he; 'hit is nat so;
  Thou wost ful litel what thou menest;
  I have lost more than thou wenest.'
 'Lo, [sir,] how may that be?' quod I;                745
  Good sir, tel me al hoolly
  In what wyse, how, why, and wherfore
  That ye have thus your blisse lore.'
   'Blythly,' quod he, 'com sit adoun;
  I telle thee up condicioun                          750
  That thou hoolly, with al thy wit,
  Do thyn entent to herkene hit.'
  Yis, sir.' 'Swere thy trouthe ther-to.'
  Gladly.' 'Do than holde her-to!'
 'I shal right blythly, so god me save,               755
  Hoolly, with al the witte I have,
  Here yow, as wel as I can.'
   'A goddes half!' quod he, and began:--
  Sir,' quod he, 'sith first I couthe
  Have any maner wit fro youthe,                      760
  Or kyndely understonding
  To comprehende, in any thing,
  What love was, in myn owne wit,
  Dredeles, I have ever yit
  Be tributary, and yiven rente                       765
  To love hoolly with goode entente,
  And through plesaunce become his thral,
  With good wil, body, herte, and al.
  Al this I putte in his servage,
  As to my lorde, and dide homage;                    770
  And ful devoutly prayde him to,
  He shulde besette myn herte so,
  That it plesaunce to him were,
  And worship to my lady dere.
   'And this was longe, and many a yeer               775
  Or that myn herte was set o-wher,
  That I did thus, and niste why;
  I trowe hit cam me kindely.
  Paraunter I was therto most able
  As a whyt wal or a table;                           780
  For hit is redy to cacche and take
  Al that men wil therin make,
  Wher-so men wol portreye or peynte,
  Be the werkes never so queynte.
   'And thilke tyme I ferde so                        785
  I was able to have lerned tho,
  And to have coud as wel or better,
  Paraunter, other art or letter.
  But for love cam first in my thought,
  Therfore I forgat it nought.                        790
  I chees love to my firste craft,
  Therfor hit is with me [y]-laft.
  Forwhy I took hit of so yong age,
  That malice hadde my corage
  Nat that tyme turned to no-thing                    795
  Through to mochel knowleching.
  For that tyme youthe, my maistresse,
  Governed me in ydelnesse;
  For hit was in my firste youthe,
  And tho ful litel good I couthe;                    800
  For al my werkes were flittinge,
  And al my thoghtes varyinge;
  Al were to me y-liche good,
  That I knew tho; but thus hit stood.
   'Hit happed that I cam on a day                    805
  Into a place, ther I say,
  Trewly, the fayrest companye
  Of ladies, that ever man with ye
  Had seen togedres in oo place.
  Shal I clepe hit hap other grace                    810
  That broghte me ther? nay, but Fortune,
  That is to lyen ful comune,
  The false trayteresse, pervers,
  God wolde I coude clepe hir wers!
  For now she worcheth me ful wo,                     815
  And I wol telle sone why so.
   'Among thise ladies thus echoon,
  Soth to seyn, I saw [ther] oon
  That was lyk noon of [al] the route;
  For I dar swere, withoute doute,                    820
  That as the someres sonne bright
  Is fairer, clerer, and hath more light
  Than any planete, [is] in heven,
  The mone, or the sterres seven,
  For al the worlde, so had she                       825
  Surmounted hem alle of beaute,
  Of maner and of comlinesse,
  Of stature and wel set gladnesse,
  Of goodlihede so wel beseye--
  Shortly, what shal I more seye?                     830
  By god, and by his halwes twelve,
  It was my swete, right as hir-selve!
  She had so stedfast countenaunce,
  So noble port and meyntenaunce.
  And Love, that had herd my bone,                    835
  Had espyed me thus sone,
  That she ful sone, in my thoght,
  As helpe me god, so was y-caught
  So sodenly, that I ne took
  No maner [reed] but at hir look                     840
  And at myn herte; for-why hir eyen
  So gladly, I trow, myn herte seyen,
  That purely tho myn owne thoght
  Seyde hit were [bet] serve hir for noght
  Than with another to be wel.                        845
  And hit was sooth, for, everydel,
  I wil anoon-right telle thee why.
   'I saw hir daunce so comlily,
  Carole and singe so swetely,
  Laughe and pleye so womanly,                        850
  And loke so debonairly,
  So goodly speke and so frendly,
  That certes, I trow, that evermore
  Nas seyn so blisful a tresore.
  For every heer [up]on hir hede,                     855
  Soth to seyn, hit was not rede,
  Ne nouther yelw, ne broun hit nas;
  Me thoghte, most lyk gold hit was.
  And whiche eyen my lady hadde!
  Debonair, goode, glade, and sadde,                  860
  Simple, of good mochel, noght to wyde;
  Therto hir look nas not a-syde,
  Ne overthwert, but beset so wel,
  Hit drew and took up, everydel,
  Alle that on hir gan beholde.                       865
  Hir eyen semed anoon she wolde
  Have mercy; fooles wenden so;
  But hit was never the rather do.
  Hit nas no countrefeted thing,
  It was hir owne pure loking,                        870
  That the goddesse, dame Nature,
  Had made hem opene by mesure,
  And close; for, were she never so glad,
  Hir loking was not foly sprad,
  Ne wildely, thogh that she pleyde;                  875
  But ever, me thoghte, hir eyen seyde,
 "By god, my wrathe is al for-yive!"
   'Therwith hir liste so wel to live,
  That dulnesse was of hir a-drad.
  She nas to sobre ne to glad;                        880
  In alle thinges more mesure
  Had never, I trowe, creature.
  But many oon with hir loke she herte,
  And that sat hir ful lyte at herte,
  For she knew no-thing of hir thoght;                885
  But whether she knew, or knew hit noght
  Algate she ne roghte of hem a stree!
  To gete hir love no ner nas he
  That woned at home, than he in Inde;
  The formest was alway behinde.                      890
  But goode folk, over al other,
  She loved as man may do his brother;
  Of whiche love she was wonder large,
  In skilful places that bere charge.
   'Which a visage had she ther-to!                   895
  Allas! myn herte is wonder wo
  That I ne can discryven hit!
  Me lakketh bothe English and wit
  For to undo hit at the fulle;
  And eek my spirits be so dulle                      900
  So greet a thing for to devyse.
  I have no wit that can suffyse
  To comprehenden hir beaute;
  But thus moche dar I seyn, that she
  Was rody, fresh, and lyvely hewed;                  905
  And every day hir beaute newed.
  And negh hir face was alder-best;
  For certes, Nature had swich lest
  To make that fair, that trewly she
  Was hir cheef patron of beautee,                    910
  And cheef ensample of al hir werke,
  And moustre; for, be hit never so derke,
  Me thinketh I see hir ever-mo.
  And yet more-over, thogh alle tho
  That ever lived were now a-lyve,                    915
  [They] ne sholde have founde to discryve
  In al hir face a wikked signe;
  For hit was sad, simple, and benigne.
   'And which a goodly softe speche
  Had that swete, my lyves leche!                     920
  So frendly, and so wel y-grounded,
  Up al resoun so wel y-founded,
  And so tretable to alle gode,
  That I dar swere by the rode,
  Of eloquence was never founde                       925
  So swete a sowninge facounde,
  Ne trewer tonged, ne scorned lasse,
  Ne bet coude hele; that, by the masse
  I durste swere, thogh the pope hit songe,
  That ther was never through hir tonge               930
  Man ne woman gretly harmed;
  As for hir, [ther] was al harm hid;
  Ne lasse flatering in hir worde,
  That purely, hir simple recorde
  Was founde as trewe as any bonde,                   935
  Or trouthe of any mannes honde.
  Ne chyde she coude never a del,
  That knoweth al the world ful wel.
   'But swich a fairnesse of a nekke
  Had that swete, that boon nor brekke                940
  Nas ther non sene, that mis-sat.
  Hit was whyt, smothe, streght, and flat,
  Withouten hole; [and] canel-boon,
  As by seming, had she noon.
  Hir throte, as I have now memoire,                  945
  Semed a round tour of yvoire,
  Of good gretnesse, and noght to grete.
   'And gode faire WHYTE she hete,
  That was my lady name right.
  She was bothe fair and bright,                      950
  She hadde not hir name wrong.
  Right faire shuldres, and body long
  She hadde, and armes, every lith
  Fattish, flesshy, not greet therwith;
  Right whyte handes, and nayles rede,                955
  Rounde brestes; and of good brede
  Hir hippes were, a streight flat bak.
  I knew on hir non other lak
  That al hir limmes nere sewing,
  In as fer as I had knowing.                         960
   'Therto she coude so wel pleye,
  Whan that hir liste, that I dar seye,
  That she was lyk to torche bright,
  That every man may take of light
  Ynogh, and hit hath never the lesse.                965
   'Of maner and of comlinesse
  Right so ferde my lady dere;
  For every wight of hir manere
  Might cacche ynogh, if that he wolde,
  If he had eyen hir to beholde.                      970
  For I dar sweren, if that she
  Had among ten thousand be,
  She wolde have be, at the leste,
  A cheef mirour of al the feste,
  Thogh they had stonden in a rowe,                   975
  To mennes eyen that coude have knowe.
  For wher-so men had pleyd or waked,
  Me thoghte the felawship as naked
  Withouten hir, that saw I ones,
  As a coroune withoute stones.                       980
  Trewely she was, to myn ye,
  The soleyn fenix of Arabye,
  For ther liveth never but oon;
  Ne swich as she ne knew I noon.
   'To speke of goodnesse; trewly she                 985
  Had as moche debonairte
  As ever had Hester in the bible,
  And more, if more were possible.
  And, soth to seyne, therwith-al
  She had a wit so general,                           990
  So hool enclyned to alle gode,
  That al hir wit was set, by the rode,
  Withoute malice, upon gladnesse;
  Therto I saw never yet a lesse
  Harmful, than she was in doing.                     995
  I sey nat that she ne had knowing
  What was harm; or elles she
  Had coud no good, so thinketh me.
   'And trewly, for to speke of trouthe,
  But she had had, hit had be routhe.                1000
  Therof she had so moche hir del--
  And I dar seyn and swere hit wel--
  That Trouthe him-self, over al and al,
  Had chose his maner principal
  In hir, that was his resting-place.                1005
  Ther-to she hadde the moste grace,
  To have stedfast perseveraunce,
  And esy, atempre governaunce,
  That ever I knew or wiste yit;
  So pure suffraunt was hir wit.                     1010
  And reson gladly she understood,
  Hit folowed wel she coude good.
  She used gladly to do wel;
  These were hir maners every-del.
   'Therwith she loved so wel right,                 1015
  She wrong do wolde to no wight;
  No wight might do hir no shame,
  She loved so wel hir owne name.
  Hir luste to holde no wight in honde;
  Ne, be thou siker, she nolde fonde                 1020
  To holde no wight in balaunce,
  By half word ne by countenaunce,
  But-if men wolde upon hir lye;
  Ne sende men in-to Walakye,
  To Pruyse and in-to Tartarye,                      1025
  To Alisaundre, ne in-to Turkye,
  And bidde him faste, anoon that he
  Go hoodles to the drye see,
  And come hoom by the Carrenare;
  And seye, "Sir, be now right ware                  1030
  That I may of yow here seyn
  Worship, or that ye come ageyn!"
  She ne used no suche knakkes smale.
   'But wherfor that I telle my tale?
  Right on this same, as I have seyd,                1035
  Was hoolly al my love leyd;
  For certes, she was, that swete wyf,
  My suffisaunce, my lust, my lyf,
  Myn hap, myn hele, and al my blisse,
  My worldes welfare and my [lisse],                 1040
  And I hirs hoolly, everydel.'
   'By our lord,' quod I, 'I trowe yow wel!
  Hardely, your love was wel beset,
  I not how ye mighte have do bet.'
 'Bet? ne no wight so wel!' quod he.                 1045
  I trowe hit, sir,' quod I, 'parde!'
  Nay, leve hit wel!' 'Sir, so do I;
  I leve yow wel, that trewely
  Yow thoghte, that she was the beste,
  And to beholde the alderfaireste,                  1050
  Who so had loked with your eyen.'
   'With myn? nay, alle that hir seyen
  Seyde, and sworen hit was so.
  And thogh they ne hadde, I wolde tho
  Have loved best my lady fre,                       1055
  Thogh I had had al the beautee
  That ever had Alcipyades,
  And al the strengthe of Ercules,
  And therto had the worthinesse
  Of Alisaundre, and al the richesse                 1060
  That ever was in Babiloyne,
  In Cartage, or in Macedoyne,
  Or in Rome, or in Ninive;
  And therto al-so hardy be
  As was Ector, so have I Ioye,                      1065
  That Achilles slow at Troye--
  And therfor was he slayn also
  In a temple, for bothe two
  Were slayn, he and Antilegius,
  And so seyth Dares Frigius,                        1070
  For love of [hir] Polixena--
  Or ben as wys as Minerva,
  I wolde ever, withoute drede,
  Have loved hir, for I moste nede!
 "Nede!" nay, I gabbe now,                           1075
  Noght "nede," and I wol telle how,
  For of good wille myn herte hit wolde,
  And eek to love hir I was holde
  As for the fairest and the beste.
   'She was as good, so have I reste,                1080
  As ever was Penelope of Grece,
  Or as the noble wyf Lucrece,
  That was the beste--he telleth thus,
  The Romain Tytus Livius--
  She was as good, and no-thing lyke,                1085
  Thogh hir stories be autentyke;
  Algate she was as trewe as she.
   'But wherfor that I telle thee
  Whan I first my lady sey?
  I was right yong, [the] sooth to sey,              1090
  And ful gret need I hadde to lerne;
  Whan my herte wolde yerne
  To love, it was a greet empryse.
  But as my wit coude best suffyse,
  After my yonge childly wit,                        1095
  Withoute drede, I besette hit
  To love hir in my beste wyse,
  To do hir worship and servyse
  That I tho coude, by my trouthe,
  Withoute feyning outher slouthe;                   1100
  For wonder fayn I wolde hir see.
  So mochel hit amended me,
  That, whan I saw hir first a-morwe,
  I was warished of al my sorwe
  Of al day after, til hit were eve;                 1105
  Me thoghte no-thing mighte me greve,
  Were my sorwes never so smerte.
  And yit she sit so in myn herte,
  That, by my trouthe, I nolde noght,
  For al this worlde, out of my thoght               1110
  Leve my lady; no, trewly!'
   'Now, by my trouthe, sir,' quod I,
  Me thinketh ye have such a chaunce
  As shrift withoute repentaunce.'
   'Repentaunce! nay fy,' quod he;                   1115
  Shulde I now repente me
  To love? nay, certes, than were I wel
  Wers than was Achitofel,
  Or Anthenor, so have I Ioye,
  The traytour that betraysed Troye,                 1120
  Or the false Genelon,
  He that purchased the treson
  Of Rowland and of Olivere.
  Nay, whyl I am a-lyve here
  I nil foryete hir never-mo.'                       1125
   'Now, goode sir,' quod I [right] tho,
  Ye han wel told me her-before.
  It is no need reherse hit more
  How ye sawe hir first, and where;
  But wolde ye telle me the manere,                  1130
  To hir which was your firste speche--
  Therof I wolde yow be-seche--
  And how she knewe first your thoght,
  Whether ye loved hir or noght,
  And telleth me eek what ye have lore;              1135
  I herde yow telle her-before.'
   'Ye,' seyde he, 'thou nost what thou menest;
  I have lost more than thou wenest.'
   'What los is that, [sir]?' quod I tho;
 'Nil she not love yow? is hit so?                   1140
  Or have ye oght [y-]doon amis,
  That she hath left yow? is hit this?
  For goddes love, tel me al.'
   'Before god,' quod he, 'and I shal.
  I saye right as I have seyd,                       1145
  On hir was al my love leyd;
  And yet she niste hit never a del
  Noght longe tyme, leve hit wel.
  For be right siker, I durste noght
  For al this worlde telle hir my thoght,            1150
  Ne I wolde have wratthed hir, trewly.
  For wostow why? she was lady
  Of the body; she had the herte,
  And who hath that, may not asterte.
   'But, for to kepe me fro ydelnesse,               1155
  Trewly I did my besinesse
  To make songes, as I best coude,
  And ofte tyme I song hem loude;
  And made songes a gret del,
  Al-thogh I coude not make so wel                   1160
  Songes, ne knowe the art al,
  As coude Lamekes sone Tubal,
  That fond out first the art of songe;
  For, as his brothers hamers ronge
  Upon his anvelt up and doun,                       1165
  Therof he took the firste soun;
  But Grekes seyn, Pictagoras,
  That he the firste finder was
  Of the art; Aurora telleth so,
  But therof no fors, of hem two.                    1170
  Algates songes thus I made
  Of my feling, myn herte to glade;
  And lo! this was [the] alther-firste,
  I not wher [that] hit were the werste.--
  ? "Lord, hit maketh myn herte light,               1175
  Whan I thenke on that swete wight
    That is so semely on to see;
    And wisshe to god hit might so be,
  That she wolde holde me for hir knight,
  My lady, that is so fair and bright!"--            1180
   'Now have I told thee, sooth to saye,
  My firste song. Upon a daye
  I bethoghte me what wo
  And sorwe that I suffred tho
  For hir, and yet she wiste hit noght,              1185
  Ne telle hir durste I nat my thoght.
 "Allas!" thoghte I, "I can no reed;
  And, but I telle hir, I nam but deed;
  And if I telle hir, to seye sooth,
  I am a-dred she wol be wrooth;                     1190
  Allas! what shal I thanne do?"
   'In this debat I was so wo,
  Me thoghte myn herte braste a-tweyn!
  So atte laste, soth to seyn,
  I me bethoghte that nature                         1195
  Ne formed never in creature
  So moche beaute, trewely,
  And bounte, withouten mercy.
   'In hope of that, my tale I tolde
  With sorwe, as that I never sholde,                1200
  For nedes; and, maugree my heed,
  I moste have told hir or be deed.
  I not wel how that I began,
  Ful evel rehersen hit I can;
  And eek, as helpe me god with-al,                  1205
  I trowe hit was in the dismal,
  That was the ten woundes of Egipte;
  For many a word I over-skipte
  In my tale, for pure fere
  Lest my wordes mis-set were.                       1210
  With sorweful herte, and woundes dede,
  Softe and quaking for pure drede
  And shame, and stinting in my tale
  For ferde, and myn hewe al pale,
  Ful ofte I wex bothe pale and reed;                1215
  Bowing to hir, I heng the heed;
  I durste nat ones loke hir on,
  For wit, manere, and al was gon.
  I seyde "mercy!" and no more;
  Hit nas no game, hit sat me sore.                  1220
   'So atte laste, sooth to seyn,
  Whan that myn herte was come ageyn,
  To telle shortly al my speche,
  With hool herte I gan hir beseche
  That she wolde be my lady swete;                   1225
  And swor, and gan hir hertely hete
  Ever to be stedfast and trewe,
  And love hir alwey freshly newe,
  And never other lady have,
  And al hir worship for to save                     1230
  As I best coude; I swor hir this--
 "For youres is al that ever ther is
  For evermore, myn herte swete!
  And never false yow, but I mete,
  I nil, as wis god helpe me so!"                    1235
   'And whan I had my tale y-do,
  God wot, she acounted nat a stree
  Of al my tale, so thoghte me.
  To telle shortly as hit is,
  Trewly hir answere, hit was this;                  1240
  I can not now wel counterfete
  Hir wordes, but this was the grete
  Of hir answere; she sayde, "nay"
  Al-outerly. Allas! that day
  The sorwe I suffred, and the wo!                   1245
  That trewly Cassandra, that so
  Bewayled the destruccioun
  Of Troye and of Ilioun,
  Had never swich sorwe as I tho.
  I durste no more say therto                        1250
  For pure fere, but stal away;
  And thus I lived ful many a day.
  That trewely, I hadde no need
  Ferther than my beddes heed
  Never a day to seche sorwe;                        1255
  I fond hit redy every morwe,
  For-why I loved hir in no gere.
   'So hit befel, another yere,
  I thoughte ones I wolde fonde
  To do hir knowe and understonde                    1260
  My wo; and she wel understood
  That I ne wilned thing but good,
  And worship, and to kepe hir name
  Over al thing, and drede hir shame,
  And was so besy hir to serve;--                    1265
  And pite were I shulde sterve,
  Sith that I wilned noon harm, y-wis.
  So whan my lady knew al this,
  My lady yaf me al hoolly
  The noble yift of hir mercy,                       1270
  Saving hir worship, by al weyes;
  Dredles, I mene noon other weyes.
  And therwith she yaf me a ring;
  I trowe hit was the firste thing;
  But if myn herte was y-waxe                        1275
  Glad, that is no need to axe!
  As helpe me god, I was as blyve,
  Reysed, as fro dethe to lyve,
  Of alle happes the alder-beste,
  The gladdest and the moste at reste.               1280
  For trewely, that swete wight,
  Whan I had wrong and she the right,
  She wolde alwey so goodely
  For-yeve me so debonairly.
  In alle my youthe, in alle chaunce,                1285
  She took me in hir governaunce.
   'Therwith she was alway so trewe,
  Our Ioye was ever y-liche newe;
  Our hertes wern so even a payre,
  That never nas that oon contrayre                  1290
  To that other, for no wo.
  For sothe, y-liche they suffred tho
  Oo blisse and eek oo sorwe bothe;
  Y-liche they were bothe gladde and wrothe;
  Al was us oon, withoute were.                      1295
  And thus we lived ful many a yere
  So wel, I can nat telle how.'
   'Sir,' quod I, 'wher is she now?'
  Now!' quod he, and stinte anoon.
    Therwith he wex as deed as stoon,                1300
  And seyde, 'allas! that I was bore!
  That was the los, that her-before
  I tolde thee, that I had lorn.
  Bethenk how I seyde her-beforn,
 "Thou wost ful litel what thou menest;              1305
  I have lost more than thou wenest"--
  God wot, allas! right that was she!'
   'Allas! sir, how? what may that be?'
  She is deed!' 'Nay!' 'Yis, by my trouthe!'
 'Is that your los? by god, hit is routhe!'          1310
    And with that worde, right anoon,
  They gan to strake forth; al was doon,
  For that tyme, the hert-hunting.
    With that, me thoghte, that this king
  Gan [quikly] hoomward for to ryde                  1315
  Unto a place ther besyde,
  Which was from us but a lyte,
  A long castel with walles whyte,
  By seynt Iohan! on a riche hil,
  As me mette; but thus it fil.                      1320
    Right thus me mette, as I yow telle,
  That in the castel was a belle,
  As hit had smiten houres twelve.--

    Therwith I awook my-selve,
  And fond me lying in my bed;                       1325
  And the book that I had red,
  Of Alcyone and Seys the king,
  And of the goddes of sleping,
  I fond it in myn honde ful even.
    Thoghte I, 'this is so queynt a sweven,          1330
  That I wol, by processe of tyme,
  Fonde to putte this sweven in ryme
  As I can best'; and that anoon.--
  This was my sweven; now hit is doon.               1334

IV. THE COMPLEYNT OF MARS.

              _The Proem._

  Gladeth, ye foules, of the morow gray,
  Lo! Venus risen among yon rowes rede!
  And floures fresshe, honoureth ye this day;
  For when the sonne uprist, then wol ye sprede.
  But ye lovers, that lye in any drede,                 5
  Fleeth, lest wikked tonges yow espye;
  Lo! yond the sonne, the candel of Ielosye!

  With teres blewe, and with a wounded herte
  Taketh your leve; and, with seynt Iohn to borow,
  Apeseth somwhat of your sorowes smerte,              10
  Tyme cometh eft, that cese shal your sorow;
  The glade night is worth an hevy morow!'--
  (Seynte Valentyne! a foul thus herde I singe
  Upon thy day, er sonne gan up-springe).--

  Yet sang this foul--'I rede yow al a-wake,           15
  And ye, that han not chosen in humble wyse,
  Without repenting cheseth yow your make.
  And ye, that han ful chosen as I devyse,
  Yet at the leste renoveleth your servyse;
  Confermeth it perpetuely to dure,                    20
  And paciently taketh your aventure.

  And for the worship of this hye feste,
  Yet wol I, in my briddes wyse, singe
  The sentence of the compleynt, at the leste,
  That woful Mars made atte departinge                 35
  Fro fresshe Venus in a morweninge,
  Whan Phebus, with his fyry torches rede,
  Ransaked every lover in his drede.

              _The Story._

  ? Whylom the thridde hevenes lord above,
  As wel by hevenish revolucioun                       30
  As by desert, hath wonne Venus his love,
  And she hath take him in subieccioun,
  And as a maistresse taught him his lessoun,
  Comaunding him that never, in hir servyse,
  He nere so bold no lover to despyse.                 35

  For she forbad him Ielosye at alle,
  And cruelte, and bost, and tirannye;
  She made him at hir lust so humble and talle,
  That when hir deyned caste on him her ye,
  He took in pacience to live or dye;                  40
  And thus she brydeleth him in hir manere,
  With no-thing but with scourging of hir chere.

  Who regneth now in blisse but Venus,
  That hath this worthy knight in governaunce?
  Who singeth now but Mars, that serveth thus          45
  The faire Venus, causer of plesaunce?
  He bynt him to perpetual obeisaunce,
  And she bynt hir to loven him for ever,
  But so be that his trespas hit dissever.

  Thus be they knit, and regnen as in heven            50
  By loking most; til hit fil, on a tyde,
  That by hir bothe assent was set a steven,
  That Mars shal entre, as faste as he may glyde,
  Into hir nexte paleys, to abyde,
  Walking his cours til she had him a-take,            55
  And he preyde hir to haste hir for his sake.

  Then seyde he thus--"myn hertes lady swete,
  Ye knowe wel my mischef in that place;
  For sikerly, til that I with yow mete,
  My lyf stant ther in aventure and grace;             60
  But when I see the beaute of your face,
  Ther is no dreed of deth may do me smerte,
  For al your lust is ese to myn herte."

  She hath so gret compassion of hir knight,
  That dwelleth in solitude til she come;              65
  For hit stood so, that ilke tyme, no wight
  Counseyled him, ne seyde to him welcome,
  That nigh hir wit for wo was overcome;
  Wherfore she spedde hir as faste in hir weye,
  Almost in oon day, as he dide in tweye.              70

  The grete Ioye that was betwix hem two,
  Whan they be met, ther may no tunge telle,
  Ther is no more, but unto bed they go,
  And thus in Ioye and blisse I let hem dwelle;
  This worthy Mars, that is of knighthod welle,        75
  The flour of fairnes lappeth in his armes,
  And Venus kisseth Mars, the god of armes.

  Soiourned hath this Mars, of which I rede,
  In chambre amid the paleys prively
  A certeyn tyme, til him fel a drede,                 80
  Through Phebus, that was comen hastely
  Within the paleys-yates sturdely,
  With torche in honde, of which the stremes brighte
  On Venus chambre knokkeden ful lighte.

  The chambre, ther as lay this fresshe quene,         85
  Depeynted was with whyte boles grete,
  And by the light she knew, that shoon so shene,
  That Phebus cam to brenne hem with his hete;
  This sely Venus, dreynt in teres wete,
  Enbraceth Mars, and seyde, "alas! I dye!             90
  The torch is come, that al this world wol wrye."

  Up sterte Mars, him liste not to slepe,
  Whan he his lady herde so compleyne;
  But, for his nature was not for to wepe,
  In stede of teres, fro his eyen tweyne               95
  The fyry sparkes brosten out for peyne;
  And hente his hauberk, that lay him besyde;
  Flee wolde he not, ne mighte him-selven hyde.

  He throweth on his helm of huge wighte,
  And girt him with his swerde; and in his honde      100
  His mighty spere, as he was wont to fighte,
  He shaketh so that almost it to-wonde;
  Ful hevy he was to walken over londe;
  He may not holde with Venus companye,
  But bad hir fleen, lest Phebus hir espye.           105

  O woful Mars! alas! what mayst thou seyn,
  That in the paleys of thy disturbaunce
  Art left behinde, in peril to be sleyn?
  And yet ther-to is double thy penaunce,
  For she, that hath thyn herte in governaunce,       110
  Is passed halfe the stremes of thyn yen;
  That thou nere swift, wel mayst thou wepe and cryen.

  Now fleeth Venus un-to Cylenius tour,
  With voide cours, for fere of Phebus light.
  Alas! and ther ne hath she no socour,               115
  For she ne fond ne saw no maner wight;
  And eek as ther she had but litil might;
  Wher-for, hir-selven for to hyde and save,
  Within the gate she fledde into a cave.

  Derk was this cave, and smoking as the helle,       120
  Not but two pas within the gate hit stood;
  A naturel day in derk I lete hir dwelle.
  Now wol I speke of Mars, furious and wood;
  For sorow he wolde have seen his herte blood;
  Sith that he mighte hir don no companye,            125
  He ne roghte not a myte for to dye.

  So feble he wex, for hete and for his wo,
  That nigh he swelt, he mighte unnethe endure;
  He passeth but oo steyre in dayes two,
  But ner the les, for al his hevy armure,            130
  He foloweth hir that is his lyves cure;
  For whos departing he took gretter yre
  Thanne for al his brenning in the fyre.

  After he walketh softely a pas,
  Compleyning, that hit pite was to here.             135
  He seyde, "O lady bright, Venus! alas!
  That ever so wyde a compas is my spere!
  Alas! whan shal I mete yow, herte dere,
  This twelfte day of April I endure,
  Through Ielous Phebus, this misaventure."           140

  Now god helpe sely Venus allone!
  But, as god wolde, hit happed for to be,
  That, whyl that Venus weping made hir mone,
  Cylenius, ryding in his chevauche,
  Fro Venus valance mighte his paleys see,            145
  And Venus he salueth, and maketh chere,
  And hir receyveth as his frend ful dere.

  Mars dwelleth forth in his adversite,
  Compleyning ever on hir departinge;
  And what his compleynt was, remembreth me;          150
  And therfore, in this lusty morweninge,
  As I best can, I wol hit seyn and singe,
  And after that I wol my leve take;
  And God yeve every wight Ioye of his make!

              The compleynt of Mars.

          _The Proem of the Compleynt._

  ? The ordre of compleynt requireth skilfully,       155
  That if a wight shal pleyne pitously,
    There mot be cause wherfor that men pleyne;
  Or men may deme he pleyneth folily
  And causeles; alas! that am not I!
    Wherfor the ground and cause of al my peyne,      160
    So as my troubled wit may hit ateyne,
  I wol reherse; not for to have redresse,
  But to declare my ground of hevinesse.

              _Devotion._

  ? The firste tyme, alas! that I was wroght,
  And for certeyn effectes hider broght               165
    By him that lordeth ech intelligence,
  I yaf my trewe servise and my thoght,
  For evermore--how dere I have hit boght!--
    To hir, that is of so gret excellence,
    That what wight that first sheweth his presence,  170
  When she is wroth and taketh of him no cure,
  He may not longe in Ioye of love endure.

  This is no feyned mater that I telle;
  My lady is the verrey sours and welle
    Of beaute, lust, fredom, and gentilnesse,         175
  Of riche aray--how dere men hit selle!--
  Of al disport in which men frendly dwelle,
    Of love and pley, and of benigne humblesse,
    Of soune of instruments of al swetnesse;
  And therto so wel fortuned and thewed,              180
  That through the world hir goodnesse is y-shewed.

  What wonder is then, thogh that I besette
  My servise on suche oon, that may me knette
    To wele or wo, sith hit lyth in hir might?
  Therfor my herte for ever I to hir hette;           185
  Ne trewly, for my dethe, I shal not lette
    To ben hir trewest servaunt and hir knight.
    I flater noght, that may wite every wight;
  For this day in hir servise shal I dye;
  But grace be, I see hir never with ye.              190

          _A Lady in fear and woe._

  ? To whom shal I than pleyne of my distresse?
  Who may me helpe, who may my harm redresse?
    Shal I compleyne unto my lady free?
  Nay, certes! for she hath such hevinesse,
  For fere and eek for wo, that, as I gesse,          195
    In litil tyme hit wol hir bane be.
    But were she sauf, hit wer no fors of me.
  Alas! that ever lovers mote endure,
  For love, so many a perilous aventure!

  For thogh so be that lovers be as trewe             200
  As any metal that is forged newe,
    In many a cas hem tydeth ofte sorowe.
  Somtyme hir ladies will not on hem rewe,
  Somtyme, yif that Ielosye hit knewe,
    They mighten lightly leye hir heed to borowe;     205
    Somtyme envyous folke with tunges horowe
  Depraven hem; alas! whom may they plese?
  But he be fals, no lover hath his ese.

  But what availeth suche a long sermoun
  Of aventures of love, up and doun?                  210
    I wol returne and speken of my peyne;
  The point is this of my destruccioun,
  My righte lady, my salvacioun,
    Is in affray, and not to whom to pleyne.
    O herte swete, O lady sovereyne!                  215
  For your disese, wel oghte I swoune and swelte,
  Thogh I non other harm ne drede felte.

          _Instability of Happiness._

  ? To what fyn made the god that sit so hye,
  Benethen him, love other companye,
    And streyneth folk to love, malgre hir hede?      220
  And then hir Ioye, for oght I can espye,
  Ne lasteth not the twinkeling of an ye,
    And somme han never Ioye til they be dede.
    What meneth this? what is this mistihede?
  Wherto constreyneth he his folk so faste            225
  Thing to desyre, but hit shulde laste?

  And thogh he made a lover love a thing,
  And maketh hit seme stedfast and during,
    Yet putteth he in hit such misaventure,
  That reste nis ther noon in his yeving.             230
  And that is wonder, that so Iust a king
    Doth such hardnesse to his creature.
    Thus, whether love breke or elles dure,
  Algates he that hath with love to done
  Hath ofter wo then changed is the mone.             235

  Hit semeth he hath to lovers enmite,
  And lyk a fissher, as men alday may see,
    Baiteth his angle-hook with som plesaunce,
  Til mony a fish is wood til that he be
  Sesed ther-with; and then at erst hath he           240
    Al his desyr, and ther-with al mischaunce;
    And thogh the lyne breke, he hath penaunce;
  For with the hoke he wounded is so sore,
  That he his wages hath for ever-more.

          _The Brooch of Thebes._

  ? The broche of Thebes was of suche a kinde,        245
  So ful of rubies and of stones Inde,
    That every wight, that sette on hit an ye,
  He wende anon to worthe out of his minde;
  So sore the beaute wolde his herte binde,
    Til he hit hadde, him thoghte he moste dye;       250
    And whan that hit was his, than shulde he drye
  Such wo for drede, ay whyl that he hit hadde,
  That welnigh for the fere he shulde madde.

  And whan hit was fro his possessioun,
  Than had he double wo and passioun                  255
    For he so fair a tresor had forgo;
  But yet this broche, as in conclusioun,
  Was not the cause of this confusioun;
    But he that wroghte hit enfortuned hit so,
    That every wight that had hit shuld have wo;      260
  And therfor in the worcher was the vyce,
  And in the covetour that was so nyce.

  So fareth hit by lovers and by me;
  For thogh my lady have so gret beaute,
    That I was mad til I had gete hir grace,          265
  She was not cause of myn adversite,
  But he that wroghte hir, also mot I thee,
    That putte suche a beaute in hir face,
    That made me to covete and purchace
  Myn owne deth; him wyte I that I dye,               270
  And myn unwit, that ever I clomb so hye.

          _An Appeal for Sympathy._

  ? But to yow, hardy knightes of renoun,
  Sin that ye be of my divisioun,
    Al be I not worthy to so grete a name,
  Yet, seyn these clerkes, I am your patroun;         275
  Ther-for ye oghte have som compassioun
    Of my disese, and take it noght a-game.
    The proudest of yow may be mad ful tame;
  Wherfor I prey yow, of your gentilesse,
  That ye compleyne for myn hevinesse.                280

  And ye, my ladies, that ben trewe and stable,
  By way of kinde, ye oghten to be able
    To have pite of folk that be in peyne:
  Now have ye cause to clothe yow in sable;
  Sith that your emperice, the honorable,             285
    Is desolat, wel oghte ye to pleyne;
    Now shuld your holy teres falle and reyne.
  Alas! your honour and your emperice,
  Nigh deed for drede, ne can hir not chevise.

  Compleyneth eek, ye lovers, al in-fere,             290
  For hir that, with unfeyned humble chere,
    Was ever redy to do yow socour;
  Compleyneth hir that ever hath had yow dere;
  Compleyneth beaute, fredom, and manere;
    Compleyneth hir that endeth your labour;          295
    Compleyneth thilke ensample of al honour,
  That never dide but al gentilesse;
  Kytheth therfor on hir som kindenesse.'             298

V. THE PARLEMENT OF FOULES.

              _The Proem._

  The lyf so short, the craft so long to lerne,
  Thassay so hard, so sharp the conquering,
  The dredful Ioy, that alwey slit so yerne,
  Al this mene I by love, that my feling
  Astonyeth with his wonderful worching                 5
  So sore y-wis, that whan I on him thinke,
  Nat wot I wel wher that I wake or winke.

  For al be that I knowe not love in dede,
  Ne wot how that he quyteth folk hir hyre,
  Yet happeth me ful ofte in bokes rede                10
  Of his miracles, and his cruel yre;
  Ther rede I wel he wol be lord and syre,
  I dar not seyn, his strokes been so sore,
  But God save swich a lord! I can no more.

  Of usage, what for luste what for lore,              15
  On bokes rede I ofte, as I yow tolde.
  But wherfor that I speke al this? not yore
  Agon, hit happed me for to beholde
  Upon a boke, was write with lettres olde;
  And ther-upon, a certeyn thing to lerne,             20
  The longe day ful faste I radde and yerne.

  For out of olde feldes, as men seith,
  Cometh al this newe corn fro yeer to yere;
  And out of olde bokes, in good feith,
  Cometh al this newe science that men lere.           25
  But now to purpos as of this matere--
  To rede forth hit gan me so delyte,
  That al the day me thoughte but a lyte.

  This book of which I make mencioun,
  Entitled was al thus, as I shal telle,               30
  Tullius of the dreme of Scipioun';
  Chapitres seven hit hadde, of hevene and helle,
  And erthe, and soules that therinne dwelle,
  Of whiche, as shortly as I can hit trete,
  Of his sentence I wol you seyn the grete.            35

  First telleth hit, whan Scipioun was come
  In Afrik, how he mette Massinisse,
  That him for Ioye in armes hath y nome.
  Than telleth [hit] hir speche and al the blisse
  That was betwix hem, til the day gan misse;          40
  And how his auncestre, African so dere,
  Gan in his slepe that night to him appere.

  Than telleth hit that, fro a sterry place,
  How African hath him Cartage shewed,
  And warned him before of al his grace,               45
  And seyde him, what man, lered other lewed,
  That loveth comun profit, wel y-thewed,
  He shal unto a blisful place wende,
  Ther as Ioye is that last withouten ende.

  Than asked he, if folk that heer be dede             50
  Have lyf and dwelling in another place;
  And African seyde, 'ye, withoute drede,'
  And that our present worldes lyves space
  Nis but a maner deth, what wey we trace,
  And rightful folk shal go, after they dye,           55
  To heven; and shewed him the galaxye.

  Than shewed he him the litel erthe, that heer is,
  At regard of the hevenes quantite;
  And after shewed he him the nyne speres,
  And after that the melodye herde he                  60
  That cometh of thilke speres thryes three,
  That welle is of musyke and melodye
  In this world heer, and cause of armonye.

  Than bad he him, sin erthe was so lyte,
  And ful of torment and of harde grace,               65
  That he ne shulde him in the world delyte.
  Than tolde he him, in certeyn yeres space,
  That every sterre shulde come into his place
  Ther hit was first; and al shulde out of minde
  That in this worlde is don of al mankinde.           70

  Than prayde him Scipioun to telle him al
  The wey to come un-to that hevene blisse;
  And he seyde, 'know thy-self first immortal,
  And loke ay besily thou werke and wisse
  To comun profit, and thou shalt nat misse            75
  To comen swiftly to that place dere,
  That ful of blisse is and of soules clere.

  But brekers of the lawe, soth to seyne,
  And lecherous folk, after that they be dede,
  Shul alwey whirle aboute therthe in peyne,           80
  Til many a world be passed, out of drede,
  And than, for-yeven alle hir wikked dede,
  Than shul they come unto that blisful place,
  To which to comen god thee sende his grace!'--

  The day gan failen, and the derke night,             85
  That reveth bestes from hir besinesse,
  Berafte me my book for lakke of light,
  And to my bedde I gan me for to dresse,
  Fulfild of thought and besy hevinesse;
  For bothe I hadde thing which that I nolde,          90
  And eek I ne hadde that thing that I wolde.

  But fynally my spirit, at the laste,
  For-wery of my labour al the day,
  Took rest, that made me to slepe faste,
  And in my slepe I mette, as I lay,                   95
  How African, right in that selfe aray
  That Scipioun him saw before that tyde,
  Was comen, and stood right at my beddes syde.

  The wery hunter, slepinge in his bed,
  To wode ayein his minde goth anoon;                 100
  The Iuge dremeth how his plees ben sped;
  The carter dremeth how his cartes goon;
  The riche, of gold; the knight fight with his foon,
  The seke met he drinketh of the tonne;
  The lover met he hath his lady wonne.               105

  Can I nat seyn if that the cause were
  For I had red of African beforn,
  That made me to mete that he stood there;
  But thus seyde he, 'thou hast thee so wel born
  In loking of myn olde book to-torn,                 110
  Of which Macrobie roghte nat a lyte,
  That somdel of thy labour wolde I quyte!'--

  Citherea! thou blisful lady swete,
  That with thy fyr-brand dauntest whom thee lest,
  And madest me this sweven for to mete,              115
  Be thou my help in this, for thou mayst best;
  As wisly as I saw thee north-north-west,
  When I began my sweven for to wryte,
  So yif me might to ryme hit and endyte!

              _The Story._

  This forseid African me hente anoon,                120
  And forth with him unto a gate broghte
  Right of a parke, walled with grene stoon;
  And over the gate, with lettres large y-wroghte,
  Ther weren vers y-writen, as me thoghte,
  On eyther halfe, of ful gret difference,            125
  Of which I shal yow sey the pleyn sentence.

  Thorgh me men goon in-to that blisful place
  Of hertes hele and dedly woundes cure;
  Thorgh me men goon unto the welle of Grace,
  Ther grene and lusty May shal ever endure;          130
  This is the wey to al good aventure;
  Be glad, thou reder, and thy sorwe of-caste,
  Al open am I; passe in, and hy the faste!'

  Thorgh me men goon,' than spak that other syde,
 'Unto the mortal strokes of the spere,               135
  Of which Disdayn and Daunger is the gyde,
  Ther tree shal never fruyt ne leves bere.
  This streem you ledeth to the sorwful were,
  Ther as the fish in prison is al drye;
  Theschewing is only the remedye.'                   140

  Thise vers of gold and blak y-writen were,
  The whiche I gan a stounde to beholde,
  For with that oon encresed ay my fere,
  And with that other gan myn herte bolde;
  That oon me hette, that other did me colde,         145
  No wit had I, for errour, for to chese,
  To entre or flee, or me to save or lese.

  Right as, betwixen adamauntes two
  Of even might, a pece of iren y-set,
  That hath no might to meve to ne fro--              150
  For what that on may hale, that other let--
  Ferde I, that niste whether me was bet,
  To entre or leve, til African my gyde
  Me hente, and shoof in at the gates wyde,

  And seyde, 'hit stondeth writen in thy face,        155
  Thyn errour, though thou telle it not to me;
  But dred thee nat to come in-to this place,
  For this wryting is no-thing ment by thee,
  Ne by noon, but he Loves servant be;
  For thou of love hast lost thy tast, I gesse,       160
  As seek man hath of swete and bitternesse.

  But natheles, al-though that thou be dulle,
  Yit that thou canst not do, yit mayst thou see;
  For many a man that may not stonde a pulle,
  Yit lyketh him at the wrastling for to be,          165
  And demeth yit wher he do bet or he;
  And if thou haddest cunning for tendyte,
  I shal thee shewen mater of to wryte.'

  With that my hond in his he took anoon,
  Of which I comfort caughte, and wente in faste;     170
  But lord! so I was glad and wel begoon!
  For over-al, wher that I myn eyen caste,
  Were trees clad with leves that ay shal laste,
  Eche in his kinde, of colour fresh and grene
  As emeraude, that Ioye was to sene.                 175

  The bilder ook, and eek the hardy asshe;
  The piler elm, the cofre unto careyne;
  The boxtree piper; holm to whippes lasshe;
  The sayling firr; the cipres, deth to pleyne;
  The sheter ew, the asp for shaftes pleyne;          180
  The olyve of pees, and eek the drunken vyne,
  The victor palm, the laurer to devyne.

  A garden saw I, ful of blosmy bowes,
  Upon a river, in a grene mede,
  Ther as that swetnesse evermore y-now is,           185
  With floures whyte, blewe, yelowe, and rede;
  And colde welle-stremes, no-thing dede,
  That swommen ful of smale fisshes lighte,
  With finnes rede and scales silver-brighte.

  On every bough the briddes herde I singe,           190
  With voys of aungel in hir armonye,
  Som besyed hem hir briddes forth to bringe;
  The litel conyes to hir pley gunne hye,
  And further al aboute I gan espye
  The dredful roo, the buk, the hert and hinde,       195
  Squerels, and bestes smale of gentil kinde.

  Of instruments of strenges in acord
  Herde I so pleye a ravisshing swetnesse,
  That god, that maker is of al and lord,
  Ne herde never better, as I gesse;                  200
  Therwith a wind, unnethe hit might be lesse,
  Made in the leves grene a noise softe
  Acordant to the foules songe on-lofte.

  The air of that place so attempre was
  That never was grevaunce of hoot ne cold;           205
  Ther wex eek every holsom spyce and gras,
  Ne no man may ther wexe seek ne old;
  Yet was ther Ioye more a thousand fold
  Then man can telle; ne never wolde it nighte,
  But ay cleer day to any mannes sighte.              210

  Under a tree, besyde a welle, I say
  Cupyde our lord his arwes forge and fyle;
  And at his fete his bowe al redy lay,
  And wel his doghter tempred al the whyle
  The hedes in the welle, and with hir wyle           215
  She couched hem after as they shulde serve,
  Som for to slee, and som to wounde and kerve.

  Tho was I war of Plesaunce anon-right,
  And of Aray, and Lust, and Curtesye;
  And of the Craft that can and hath the might        220
  To doon by force a wight to do folye--
  Disfigurat was she, I nil not lye;
  And by him-self, under an oke, I gesse,
  Sawe I Delyt, that stood with Gentilnesse.

  I saw Beautee, withouten any atyr,                  225
  And Youthe, ful of game and Iolyte,
  Fool-hardinesse, Flatery, and Desyr,
  Messagerye, and Mede, and other three--
  Hir names shul noght here be told for me--
  And upon pilers grete of Iasper longe               230
  I saw a temple of bras y-founded stronge.

  Aboute the temple daunceden alway
  Wommen y-nowe, of whiche somme ther were
  Faire of hem-self, and somme of hem were gay;
  In kirtels, al disshevele, wente they there--       235
  That was hir office alwey, yeer by yere--
  And on the temple, of doves whyte and faire
  Saw I sittinge many a hundred paire.

  Before the temple-dore ful soberly
  Dame Pees sat, with a curteyn in hir hond:          240
  And hir besyde, wonder discretly,
  Dame Pacience sitting ther I fond
  With face pale, upon an hille of sond;
  And alder-next, within and eek with-oute,
  Behest and Art, and of hir folke a route.           245

  Within the temple, of syghes hote as fyr
  I herde a swogh that gan aboute renne;
  Which syghes were engendred with desyr,
  That maden every auter for to brenne
  Of newe flaume; and wel aspyed I thenne             250
  That al the cause of sorwes that they drye
  Com of the bitter goddesse Ialousye.

  The god Priapus saw I, as I wente,
  Within the temple, in soverayn place stonde,
  In swich aray as whan the asse him shente           255
  With crye by night, and with his ceptre in honde;
  Ful besily men gunne assaye and fonde
  Upon his hede to sette, of sondry hewe,
  Garlondes ful of fresshe floures newe.

  And in a privee corner, in disporte,                260
  Fond I Venus and hir porter Richesse,
  That was ful noble and hauteyn of hir porte;
  Derk was that place, but afterward lightnesse
  I saw a lyte, unnethe hit might be lesse,
  And on a bed of golde she lay to reste,             265
  Til that the hote sonne gan to weste.

  Hir gilte heres with a golden threde
  Y-bounden were, untressed as she lay,
  And naked fro the breste unto the hede
  Men might hir see; and, sothly for to say,          270
  The remenant wel kevered to my pay
  Right with a subtil kerchef of Valence,
  Ther was no thikker cloth of no defence.

  The place yaf a thousand savours swote,
  And Bachus, god of wyn, sat hir besyde,             275
  And Ceres next, that doth of hunger bote;
  And, as I seide, amiddes lay Cipryde,
  To whom on knees two yonge folkes cryde
  To ben hir help; but thus I leet hir lye,
  And ferther in the temple I gan espye               280

  That, in dispyte of Diane the chaste,
  Ful many a bowe y-broke heng on the wal
  Of maydens, suche as gunne hir tymes waste
  In hir servyse; and peynted over al
  Of many a story, of which I touche shal             285
  A fewe, as of Calixte and Athalaunte,
  And many a mayde, of which the name I wante;

  Semyramus, Candace, and Ercules,
  Biblis, Dido, Tisbe and Piramus,
  Tristram, Isoude, Paris, and Achilles,              290
  Eleyne, Cleopatre, and Troilus,
  Silla, and eek the moder of Romulus--
  Alle these were peynted on that other syde,
  And al hir love, and in what plyte they dyde.

  Whan I was come ayen into the place                 295
  That I of spak, that was so swote and grene,
  Forth welk I tho, my-selven to solace.
  Tho was I war wher that ther sat a quene
  That, as of light the somer-sonne shene
  Passeth the sterre, right so over mesure            300
  She fairer was than any creature.

  And in a launde, upon an hille of floures,
  Was set this noble goddesse Nature;
  Of braunches were hir halles and hir boures,
  Y-wrought after hir craft and hir mesure;           305
  Ne ther nas foul that cometh of engendrure,
  That they ne were prest in hir presence,
  To take hir doom and yeve hir audience.

  For this was on seynt Valentynes day,
  Whan every foul cometh ther to chese his make,      310
  Of every kinde, that men thenke may;
  And that so huge a noyse gan they make,
  That erthe and see, and tree, and every lake
  So ful was, that unnethe was ther space
  For me to stonde, so ful was al the place.          315

  And right as Aleyn, in the Pleynt of Kinde,
  Devyseth Nature of aray and face,
  In swich aray men mighten hir ther finde.
  This noble emperesse, ful of grace,
  Bad every foul to take his owne place,              320
  As they were wont alwey fro yeer to yere,
  Seynt Valentynes day, to stonden there.

  That is to sey, the foules of ravyne
  Were hyest set; and than the foules smale,
  That eten as hem nature wolde enclyne,              325
  As worm, or thing of whiche I telle no tale;
  But water-foul sat lowest in the dale;
  And foul that liveth by seed sat on the grene,
  And that so fele, that wonder was to sene.

  Ther mighte men the royal egle finde,               330
  That with his sharpe look perceth the sonne;
  And other egles of a lower kinde,
  Of which that clerkes wel devysen conne.
  Ther was the tyraunt with his fethres donne
  And greye, I mene the goshauk, that doth pyne       335
  To briddes for his outrageous ravyne.

  The gentil faucon, that with his feet distreyneth
  The kinges hond; the hardy sperhauk eke,
  The quayles foo; the merlion that peyneth
  Him-self ful ofte, the larke for to seke;           340
  Ther was the douve, with hir eyen meke;
  The Ialous swan, ayens his deth that singeth;
  The oule eek, that of dethe the bode bringeth;

  The crane the geaunt, with his trompes soune;
  The theef, the chogh; and eek the Iangling pye;     345
  The scorning Iay; the eles foo, the heroune;
  The false lapwing, ful of trecherye;
  The stare, that the counseyl can bewrye;
  The tame ruddok; and the coward kyte;
  The cok, that orloge is of thorpes lyte;            350

  The sparow, Venus sone; the nightingale,
  That clepeth forth the fresshe leves newe;
  The swalow, mordrer of the flyes smale
  That maken hony of floures fresshe of hewe;
  The wedded turtel, with hir herte trewe;            355
  The pecok, with his aungels fethres brighte;
  The fesaunt, scorner of the cok by nighte;

  The waker goos; the cukkow ever unkinde;
  The popiniay, ful of delicasye;
  The drake, stroyer of his owne kinde;               360
  The stork, the wreker of avouterye;
  The hote cormeraunt of glotonye;
  The raven wys, the crow with vois of care;
  The throstel olde; the frosty feldefare.

  What shulde I seyn? of foules every kinde           365
  That in this worlde han fethres and stature,
  Men mighten in that place assembled finde
  Before the noble goddesse Nature.
  And everich of hem did his besy cure
  Benignely to chese or for to take,                  370
  By hir acord, his formel or his make.

  But to the poynt--Nature held on hir honde
  A formel egle, of shap the gentileste
  That ever she among hir werkes fonde,
  The most benigne and the goodlieste;                375
  In hir was every vertu at his reste,
  So ferforth, that Nature hir-self had blisse
  To loke on hir, and ofte hir bek to kisse.

  Nature, the vicaire of thalmyghty lorde,
  That hoot, cold, hevy, light, [and] moist and dreye 380
  Hath knit by even noumbre of acorde,
  In esy vois began to speke and seye,
  Foules, tak hede of my sentence, I preye,
  And, for your ese, in furthering of your nede,
  As faste as I may speke, I wol me spede.            385

  Ye know wel how, seynt Valentynes day,
  By my statut and through my governaunce,
  Ye come for to chese--and flee your way--
  Your makes, as I prik yow with plesaunce.
  But natheles, my rightful ordenaunce                390
  May I not lete, for al this world to winne,
  That he that most is worthy shal beginne.

  The tercel egle, as that ye knowen wel,
  The foul royal above yow in degree,
  The wyse and worthy, secree, trewe as stel,         395
  The which I formed have, as ye may see,
  In every part as hit best lyketh me,
  Hit nedeth noght his shap yow to devyse,
  He shal first chese and speken in his gyse.

  And after him, by order shul ye chese,              400
  After your kinde, everich as yow lyketh,
  And, as your hap is, shul ye winne or lese;
  But which of yow that love most entryketh,
  God sende him hir that sorest for him syketh.'
  And therwith-al the tercel gan she calle,           405
  And seyde, 'my sone, the choys is to thee falle.

  But natheles, in this condicioun
  Mot be the choys of everich that is here,
  That she agree to his eleccioun,
  Who-so he be that shulde been hir fere;             410
  This is our usage alwey, fro yeer to yere;
  And who so may at this time have his grace,
  In blisful tyme he com in-to this place.'

  With hed enclyned and with ful humble chere
  This royal tercel spak and taried nought;           415
  Unto my sovereyn lady, and noght my fere,
  I chese, and chese with wille and herte and thought,
  The formel on your hond so wel y-wrought,
  Whos I am al and ever wol hir serve,
  Do what hir list, to do me live or sterve.          420

  Beseching hir of mercy and of grace,
  As she that is my lady sovereyne;
  Or let me dye present in this place.
  For certes, long may I not live in peyne;
  For in myn herte is corven every veyne;             425
  Having reward only to my trouthe,
  My dere herte, have on my wo som routhe.

  And if that I to hir be founde untrewe,
  Disobeysaunt, or wilful negligent,
  Avauntour, or in proces love a newe,                430
  I pray to you this be my Iugement,
  That with these foules I be al to-rent,
  That ilke day that ever she me finde
  To hir untrewe, or in my gilte unkinde.

  And sin that noon loveth hir so wel as I,           435
  Al be she never of love me behette,
  Than oghte she be myn thourgh hir mercy,
  For other bond can I noon on hir knette.
  For never, for no wo, ne shal I lette
  To serven hir, how fer so that she wende;           440
  Sey what yow list, my tale is at an ende.'

  Right as the fresshe, rede rose newe
  Ayen the somer-sonne coloured is,
  Right so for shame al wexen gan the hewe
  Of this formel, whan she herde al this;             445
  She neyther answerde 'wel,' ne seyde amis,
  So sore abasshed was she, til that Nature
  Seyde, 'doghter, drede yow noght, I yow assure.'

  Another tercel egle spak anoon
  Of lower kinde, and seyde, 'that shal not be;       450
  I love hir bet than ye do, by seynt Iohn,
  Or atte leste I love hir as wel as ye;
  And lenger have served hir, in my degree,
  And if she shulde have loved for long loving,
  To me allone had been the guerdoning.               455

  I dar eek seye, if she me finde fals,
  Unkinde, Iangler, or rebel any wyse,
  Or Ialous, do me hongen by the hals!
  And but I bere me in hir servyse
  As wel as that my wit can me suffyse,               460
  Fro poynt to poynt, hir honour for to save,
  Tak she my lyf, and al the good I have.'

  The thridde tercel egle answerde tho,
  Now, sirs, ye seen the litel leyser here;
  For every foul cryeth out to been a-go              465
  Forth with his make, or with his lady dere;
  And eek Nature hir-self ne wol nought here,
  For tarying here, noght half that I wolde seye;
  And but I speke, I mot for sorwe deye.

  Of long servyse avaunte I me no-thing,              470
  But as possible is me to dye to-day
  For wo, as he that hath ben languisshing
  Thise twenty winter, and wel happen may
  A man may serven bet and more to pay
  In half a yere, al-though hit were no more,         475
  Than som man doth that hath served ful yore.

  I ne say not this by me, for I ne can
  Do no servyse that may my lady plese;
  But I dar seyn, I am hir trewest man
  As to my dome, and feynest wolde hir ese;           480
  At shorte wordes, til that deth me sese,
  I wol ben hires, whether I wake or winke,
  And trewe in al that herte may bethinke.'

  Of al my lyf, sin that day I was born,
  So gentil plee in love or other thing               485
  Ne herde never no man me beforn,
  Who-[so] that hadde leyser and cunning
  For to reherse hir chere and hir speking;
  And from the morwe gan this speche laste
  Til dounward drow the sonne wonder faste.           490

  The noyse of foules for to ben delivered
  So loude rong, 'have doon and let us wende!'
  That wel wende I the wode had al to-shivered.
  Come of!' they cryde, 'allas! ye wil us shende!
  Whan shal your cursed pleding have an ende?         495
  How shulde a Iuge eyther party leve,
  For yee or nay, with-outen any preve?'

  The goos, the cokkow, and the doke also
  So cryden 'kek, kek!' 'kukkow!' 'quek, quek!' hye,
  That thorgh myn eres the noyse wente tho.           500
  The goos seyde, 'al this nis not worth a flye!
  But I can shape hereof a remedye,
  And I wol sey my verdit faire and swythe
  For water-foul, who-so be wrooth or blythe.'

 'And I for worm-foul,' seyde the fool cukkow,        505
  For I wol, of myn owne auctorite,
  For comune spede, take the charge now,
  For to delivere us is gret charite.'
  Ye may abyde a whyle yet, parde!'
  Seide the turtel, 'if hit be your wille             510
  A wight may speke, him were as good be stille.

  I am a seed-foul, oon the unworthieste,
  That wot I wel, and litel of kunninge;
  But bet is that a wightes tonge reste
  Than entremeten him of such doinge                  515
  Of which he neyther rede can nor singe.
  And who-so doth, ful foule himself acloyeth,
  For office uncommitted ofte anoyeth.'

  Nature, which that alway had an ere
  To murmour of the lewednes behinde,                 520
  With facound voys seide, 'hold your tonges there!
  And I shal sone, I hope, a counseyl finde
  You to delivere, and fro this noyse unbinde;
  I Iuge, of every folk men shal oon calle
  To seyn the verdit for you foules alle.'            525

  Assented were to this conclusioun
  The briddes alle; and foules of ravyne
  Han chosen first, by pleyn eleccioun,
  The tercelet of the faucon, to diffyne
  Al hir sentence, and as him list, termyne;          530
  And to Nature him gonnen to presente,
  And she accepteth him with glad entente.

  The tercelet seide than in this manere:
  Ful hard were hit to preve hit by resoun
  Who loveth best this gentil formel here;            535
  For everich hath swich replicacioun,
  That noon by skilles may be broght a-doun;
  I can not seen that arguments avayle;
  Than semeth hit ther moste be batayle.'

 'Al redy!' quod these egles tercels tho.             540
  Nay, sirs!' quod he, 'if that I dorste it seye,
  Ye doon me wrong, my tale is not y-do!
  For sirs, ne taketh noght a-gref, I preye,
  It may noght gon, as ye wolde, in this weye;
  Oure is the voys that han the charge in honde,      545
  And to the Iuges dome ye moten stonde;

  And therfor pees! I seye, as to my wit,
  Me wolde thinke how that the worthieste
  Of knighthode, and lengest hath used hit,
  Moste of estat, of blode the gentileste,            550
  Were sittingest for hir, if that hir leste;
  And of these three she wot hir-self, I trowe,
  Which that he be, for hit is light to knowe.'

  The water-foules han her hedes leyd
  Togeder, and of short avysement,                    555
  Whan everich had his large golee seyd,
  They seyden sothly, al by oon assent,
  How that 'the goos, with hir facounde gent,
  That so desyreth to pronounce our nede,
  Shal telle our tale,' and preyde 'god hir spede.'   560

  And for these water-foules tho began
  The goos to speke, and in hir cakelinge
  She seyde, 'pees! now tak kepe every man,
  And herkeneth which a reson I shal bringe;
  My wit is sharp, I love no taryinge;                565
  I seye, I rede him, though he were my brother,
  But she wol love him, lat him love another!'

  Lo here! a parfit reson of a goos!'
  Quod the sperhauk; 'never mot she thee!
  Lo, swich hit is to have a tonge loos!              570
  Now parde, fool, yet were hit bet for thee
  Have holde thy pees, than shewed thy nycete!
  Hit lyth not in his wit nor in his wille,
  But sooth is seyd, "a fool can noght be stille."'

  The laughter aroos of gentil foules alle,           575
  And right anoon the seed-foul chosen hadde
  The turtel trewe, and gunne hir to hem calle,
  And preyden hir to seye the sothe sadde
  Of this matere, and asked what she radde;
  And she answerde, that pleynly hir entente          580
  She wolde shewe, and sothly what she mente.

  Nay, god forbede a lover shulde chaunge!'
  The turtel seyde, and wex for shame al reed;
  Thogh that his lady ever-more be straunge,
  Yet let him serve hir ever, til he be deed;         585
  For sothe, I preyse noght the gooses reed;
  For thogh she deyed, I wolde non other make,
  I wol ben hires, til that the deth me take.'

  Wel bourded!' quod the doke, 'by my hat!
  That men shulde alwey loven, causeles,              590
  Who can a reson finde or wit in that?
  Daunceth he mury that is mirtheles?
  Who shulde recche of that is reccheles?
  Ye, quek!' yit quod the doke, ful wel and faire,
 'There been mo sterres, god wot, than a paire!'      595

  Now fy, cherl!' quod the gentil tercelet,
  Out of the dunghil com that word ful right,
  Thou canst noght see which thing is wel be-set:
  Thou farest by love as oules doon by light,
  The day hem blent, ful wel they see by night;       600
  Thy kind is of so lowe a wrechednesse,
  That what love is, thou canst nat see ne gesse.'

  Tho gan the cukkow putte him forth in prees
  For foul that eteth worm, and seide blyve,
 'So I,' quod he, 'may have my make in pees,          605
  I recche not how longe that ye stryve;
  Lat ech of hem be soleyn al hir lyve,
  This is my reed, sin they may not acorde;
  This shorte lesson nedeth noght recorde.'

 'Ye! have the glotoun fild ynogh his paunche,        610
  Than are we wel!' seyde the merlioun;
  Thou mordrer of the heysugge on the braunche
  That broghte thee forth, thou [rewthelees] glotoun!
  Live thou soleyn, wormes corrupcioun!
  For no fors is of lakke of thy nature;              615
  Go, lewed be thou, whyl the world may dure!'

  Now pees,' quod Nature, 'I comaunde here;
  For I have herd al your opinioun,
  And in effect yet be we never the nere;
  But fynally, this is my conclusioun,                620
  That she hir-self shal han the eleccioun
  Of whom hir list, who-so be wrooth or blythe,
  Him that she cheest, he shal hir have as swythe.

  For sith hit may not here discussed be
  Who loveth hir best, as seide the tercelet,         625
  Than wol I doon hir this favour, that she
  Shal have right him on whom hir herte is set,
  And he hir that his herte hath on hir knet.
  This Iuge I, Nature, for I may not lye;
  To noon estat I have non other ye.                  630

  But as for counseyl for to chese a make,
  If hit were reson, certes, than wolde I
  Counseyle yow the royal tercel take,
  As seide the tercelet ful skilfully,
  As for the gentilest and most worthy,               635
  Which I have wroght so wel to my plesaunce;
  That to yow oghte been a suffisaunce.'

  With dredful vois the formel hir answerde,
  My rightful lady, goddesse of Nature,
  Soth is that I am ever under your yerde,            640
  Lyk as is everiche other creature,
  And moot be youres whyl my lyf may dure;
  And therfor graunteth me my firste bone,
  And myn entente I wol yow sey right sone.'

 'I graunte it you,' quod she; and right anoon        645
  This formel egle spak in this degree,
  Almighty quene, unto this yeer be doon
  I aske respit for to avysen me.
  And after that to have my choys al free;
  This al and som, that I wolde speke and seye;       650
  Ye gete no more, al-though ye do me deye.

  I wol noght serven Venus ne Cupyde
  For sothe as yet, by no manere wey.'
  Now sin it may non other wyse betyde,'
  Quod tho Nature, 'here is no more to sey;           655
  Than wolde I that these foules were a-wey
  Ech with his make, for tarying lenger here'--
  And seyde hem thus, as ye shul after here.

  To you speke I, ye tercelets,' quod Nature,
 'Beth of good herte and serveth, alle three;         660
  A yeer is not so longe to endure,
  And ech of yow peyne him, in his degree,
  For to do wel; for, god wot, quit is she
  Fro yow this yeer; what after so befalle,
  This entremes is dressed for you alle.'             665

  And whan this werk al broght was to an ende,
  To every foule Nature yaf his make
  By even acorde, and on hir wey they wende.
  A! lord! the blisse and Ioye that they make!
  For ech of hem gan other in winges take,            670
  And with hir nekkes ech gan other winde,
  Thanking alwey the noble goddesse of kinde.

  But first were chosen foules for to singe,
  As yeer by yere was alwey hir usaunce
  To singe a roundel at hir departinge,               675
  To do Nature honour and plesaunce.
  The note, I trowe, maked was in Fraunce;
  The wordes wer swich as ye may heer finde,
  The nexte vers, as I now have in minde.

         _Qui bien aime a tard oublie._

 'Now welcom somer, with thy sonne softe,             680
  That hast this wintres weders over-shake,
  And driven awey the longe nightes blake!

  Seynt Valentyn, that art ful hy on-lofte;--
  Thus singen smale foules for thy sake--
     _Now welcom somer, with thy sonne softe,_        685
     _That hast this wintres weders over-shake._

  Wel han they cause for to gladen ofte,
  Sith ech of hem recovered hath his make;
  Ful blisful may they singen whan they wake;
     _Now welcom somer, with thy sonne softe,_        690
     _That hast this wintres weders over-shake,_
     _And driven awey the longe nightes blake_.'

  And with the showting, whan hir song was do,
  That foules maden at hir flight a-way,
  I wook, and other bokes took me to                  695
  To rede upon, and yet I rede alway;
  I hope, y-wis, to rede so som day
  That I shal mete som thing for to fare
  The bet; and thus to rede I nil not spare.          699

VI. A COMPLEINT TO HIS LADY.

          I. (_In seven-line stanzas._)

  The longe night, whan every creature
    Shulde have hir rest in somwhat, as by kinde,
  Or elles ne may hir lyf nat long endure,
    Hit falleth most in-to my woful minde
    How I so fer have broght my-self behinde,           5
  That, sauf the deeth, ther may no-thing me lisse,
  So desespaired I am from alle blisse.

  This same thoght me lasteth til the morwe,
    And from the morwe forth til hit be eve;
  Ther nedeth me no care for to borwe,                 10
    For bothe I have good leyser and good leve;
    Ther is no wight that wol me wo bereve
  To wepe y-nogh, and wailen al my fille;
  The sore spark of peyne doth me spille.

          II. (_In Terza Rima; imperfect._)

  [The sore spark of peyne doth me spille;]            15
    This Love hath [eek] me set in swich a place
    That my desyr [he] never wol fulfille;
  For neither pitee, mercy, neither grace
    Can I nat finde; and [fro] my sorwful herte,
    For to be deed, I can hit nat arace.               20
  The more I love, the more she doth me smerte;
    Through which I see, with-oute remedye,
    That from the deeth I may no wyse asterte;
  [For this day in hir servise shal I dye].

          III. (_In Terza Rima; imperfect._)

  [Thus am I slain, with sorwes ful dyverse;           25
    Ful longe agoon I oghte have taken hede].
    Now sothly, what she hight I wol reherse;
  Hir name is Bountee, set in womanhede,
    Sadnesse in youthe, and Beautee prydelees,
    And Plesaunce, under governaunce and drede;        30
  Hir surname eek is Faire Rewthelees,
    The Wyse, y-knit un-to Good Aventure,
    That, for I love hir, sleeth me giltelees.
  Hir love I best, and shal, whyl I may dure,
    Bet than my-self an hundred thousand deel,         35
    Than al this worldes richesse or creature.
  Now hath nat Love me bestowed weel
    To love, ther I never shal have part?
    Allas! right thus is turned me the wheel,
  Thus am I slayn with loves fyry dart.                40
    I can but love hir best, my swete fo;
    Love hath me taught no more of his art
  But serve alwey, and stinte for no wo.

          IV. (_In ten-line stanzas._)

  [With]-in my trewe careful herte ther is
  So moche wo, and [eek] so litel blis,                45
    That wo is me that ever I was bore;
  For al that thing which I desyre I mis,
  And al that ever I wolde nat, I-wis,
    That finde I redy to me evermore;
  And of al this I not to whom me pleyne.              50
    For she that mighte me out of this bringe
    Ne reccheth nat whether I wepe or singe;
  So litel rewthe hath she upon my peyne.

  Allas! whan sleping-time is, than I wake,
  Whan I shulde daunce, for fere than I quake;         55
    [Yow rekketh never wher I flete or sinke;]
  This hevy lyf I lede for your sake,
  Thogh ye ther-of in no wyse hede take,
    [For on my wo yow deyneth not to thinke.]
  My hertes lady, and hool my lyves quene!             60
    For trewly dorste I seye, as that I fele,
    Me semeth that your swete herte of stele
  Is whetted now ageynes me to kene.

  My dere herte, and best beloved fo,
  Why lyketh yow to do me al this wo,                  65
    What have I doon that greveth yow, or sayd,
  But for I serve and love yow and no mo?
  And whylst I live, I wol do ever so;
    And therfor, swete, ne beth nat evil apayd.
  For so good and so fair as [that] ye be,             70
    Hit were [a] right gret wonder but ye hadde
    Of alle servants, bothe goode and badde;
  And leest worthy of alle hem, I am he.

  But never-the-les, my righte lady swete,
  Thogh that I be unconning and unmete                 75
    To serve as I best coude ay your hynesse.
  Yit is ther fayner noon, that wolde I hete,
  Than I, to do yow ese, or elles bete
    What-so I wiste were to [yow distresse].
  And hadde I might as good as I have wille,           80
    Than shulde ye fele wher it wer so or noon;
    For in this worlde living is ther noon
  That fayner wolde your hertes wil fulfille.

  For bothe I love, and eek dreed yow so sore,
  And algates moot, and have doon yow, ful yore,       85
    That bet loved is noon, ne never shal;
  And yit I wolde beseche yow of no more
  But leveth wel, and be nat wrooth ther-fore,
    And lat me serve yow forth; lo! this is al.
  For I am nat so hardy ne so wood                     90
    For to desire that ye shulde love me;
    For wel I wot, allas! that may nat be;
  I am so litel worthy, and ye so good.

  For ye be oon the worthiest on-lyve,
  And I the most unlykly for to thryve;                95
    Yit, for al this, [now] witeth ye right wele,
  That ye ne shul me from your service dryve
  That I nil ay, with alle my wittes fyve,
    Serve yow trewly, what wo so that I fele.
  For I am set on yow in swich manere                 100
    That, thogh ye never wil upon me rewe,
    I moste yow love, and ever been as trewe
  As any can or may on-lyve [here].

  The more that I love yow, goodly free,
  The lasse fynde I that ye loven me;                 105
    Allas! whan shal that harde wit amende?
  Wher is now al your wommanly pitee,
  Your gentilesse and your debonairtee,
    Wil ye no thing ther-of upon me spende?
  And so hool, swete, as I am youres al,              110
    And so gret wil as I have yow to serve,
    Now, certes, and ye lete me thus sterve,
  Yit have ye wonne ther-on but a smal.

  For, at my knowing, I do no-thing why,
  And this I wol beseche yow hertely,                 115
    That, ther ever ye finde, whyl ye live,
  A trewer servant to yow than am I,
  Leveth [me] thanne, and sleeth me hardely,
    And I my deeth to you wol al forgive.
  And if ye finde no trewer [man than me],            120
    [Why] will ye suffre than that I thus spille,
    And for no maner gilt but my good wille?
  As good wer thanne untrewe as trewe to be.

  But I, my lyf and deeth, to yow obeye,
  And with right buxom herte hoolly I preye,          125
    As [is] your moste plesure, so doth by me;
  Wel lever is me lyken yow and deye
  Than for to any thing or thinke or seye
    That mighte yow offende in any tyme.
  And therfor, swete, rewe on my peynes smerte,       130
    And of your grace granteth me som drope;
    For elles may me laste ne blis ne hope,
  Ne dwellen in my trouble careful herte.

VII. ANELIDA AND ARCITE.

  THE COMPLEYNT OF FEIRE ANELIDA AND FALS ARCITE.

                  _Proem._

  Thou ferse god of armes, Mars the rede,
  That in the frosty country called Trace,
  Within thy grisly temple ful of drede
  Honoured art, as patroun of that place!
  With thy Bellona, Pallas, ful of grace,                   5
  Be present, and my song continue and gye;
  At my beginning thus to thee I crye.

  For hit ful depe is sonken in my minde,
  With pitous herte in English for tendyte
  This olde storie, in Latin which I finde,                10
  Of quene Anelida and fals Arcite,
  That elde, which that al can frete and byte,
  As hit hath freten mony a noble storie,
  Hath nigh devoured out of our memorie.

  Be favorable eek, thou Polymnia,                         15
  On Parnaso that, with thy sustres glade,
  By Elicon, not fer from Cirrea,
  Singest with vois memorial in the shade,
  Under the laurer which that may not fade,
  And do that I my ship to haven winne;
  First folow I Stace, and after him Corinne.

              _The Story._

  _Iamque domos patrias, &c._; Statii Thebais, xii. 519.

  Whan Theseus, with werres longe and grete,
  The aspre folk of Cithe had over-come,
  With laurer crouned, in his char gold-bete,
  Hoom to his contre-houses is y-come;--                   25
  For which the peple blisful, al and somme,
  So cryden, that unto the sterres hit wente,
  And him to honouren dide al hir entente;--

  Beforn this duk, in signe of hy victorie,
  The trompes come, and in his baner large                 30
  The image of Mars; and, in token of glorie,
  Men mighten seen of tresor many a charge,
  Many a bright helm, and many a spere and targe,
  Many a fresh knight, and many a blisful route,
  On hors, on fote, in al the felde aboute.                35

  Ipolita his wyf, the hardy quene
  Of Cithia, that he conquered hadde,
  With Emelye, hir yonge suster shene,
  Faire in a char of golde he with him ladde,
  That al the ground aboute hir char she spradde           40
  With brightnesse of the beautee in hir face,
  Fulfild of largesse and of alle grace.

  With his triumphe and laurer crouned thus,
  In al the floure of fortunes yevinge,
  Lete I this noble prince Theseus                         45
  Toward Athenes in his wey rydinge,
  And founde I wol in shortly for to bringe
  The slye wey of that I gan to wryte,
  Of quene Anelida and fals Arcite.

  Mars, which that through his furious course of yre,      50
  The olde wrath of Iuno to fulfille,
  Hath set the peples hertes bothe on fyre
  Of Thebes and Grece, everich other to kille
  With blody speres, ne rested never stille,
  But throng now her, now ther, among hem bothe,           55
  That everich other slough, so wer they wrothe.

  For whan Amphiorax and Tydeus,
  Ipomedon, Parthonopee also
  Were dede, and slayn [was] proud Campaneus,
  And whan the wrecches Thebans, bretheren two,            60
  Were slayn, and king Adrastus hoom a-go,
  So desolat stood Thebes and so bare,
  That no wight coude remedie of his care.

  And whan the olde Creon gan espye
  How that the blood roial was broght adoun,               65
  He held the cite by his tirannye,
  And did the gentils of that regioun
  To been his frendes, and dwellen in the toun.
  So what for love of him, and what for awe,
  The noble folk wer to the toune y-drawe.                 70

  Among al these, Anelida the quene
  Of Ermony was in that toun dwellinge,
  That fairer was then is the sonne shene;
  Through-out the world so gan hir name springe,
  That hir to seen had every wight lykinge;                75
  For, as of trouthe, is ther noon hir liche,
  Of al the women in this worlde riche.

  Yong was this quene, of twenty yeer of elde,
  Of midel stature, and of swich fairnesse,
  That nature had a Ioye hir to behelde;                   80
  And for to speken of hir stedfastnesse,
  She passed hath Penelope and Lucresse,
  And shortly, if she shal be comprehended,
  In hir ne mighte no-thing been amended.

  This Theban knight [Arcite] eek, sooth to seyn,          85
  Was yong, and ther-with-al a lusty knight,
  But he was double in love and no-thing pleyn,
  And subtil in that crafte over any wight,
  And with his cunning wan this lady bright;
  For so ferforth he gan hir trouthe assure,               90
  That she him [trust] over any creature.

  What shuld I seyn? she loved Arcite so,
  That, whan that he was absent any throwe,
  Anon hir thoghte hir herte brast a-two;
  For in hir sight to hir he bar him lowe,                 95
  So that she wende have al his herte y-knowe;
  But he was fals; it nas but feyned chere,
  As nedeth not to men such craft to lere.

  But never-the-les ful mikel besinesse
  Had he, er that he mighte his lady winne,               100
  And swoor he wolde dyen for distresse,
  Or from his wit he seyde he wolde twinne.
  Alas, the whyle! for hit was routhe and sinne,
  That she upon his sorowes wolde rewe,
  But no-thing thenketh the fals as doth the trewe.       105

  Hir fredom fond Arcite in swich manere,
  That al was his that she hath, moche or lyte,
  Ne to no creature made she chere
  Ferther than that hit lyked to Arcite;
  Ther was no lak with which he mighte hir wyte,          110
  She was so ferforth yeven him to plese,
  That al that lyked him, hit did hir ese.

  Ther nas to hir no maner lettre y-sent
  That touched love, from any maner wight,
  That she ne shewed hit him, er hit was brent;           115
  So pleyn she was, and did hir fulle might,
  That she nil hyden nothing from hir knight,
  Lest he of any untrouthe hir upbreyde;
  Withouten bode his heste she obeyde.

  And eek he made him Ielous over here,                   120
  That, what that any man had to hir seyd,
  Anoon he wolde preyen hir to swere
  What was that word, or make him evel apayd;
  Than wende she out of hir wit have brayd;
  But al this nas but sleight and flaterye,               125
  Withouten love he feyned Ielosye.

  And al this took she so debonerly,
  That al his wille, hir thoghte hit skilful thing,
  And ever the lenger loved him tenderly,
  And did him honour as he were a king.                   130
  Hir herte was wedded to him with a ring;
  So ferforth upon trouthe is hir entente,
  That wher he goth, hir herte with him wente.

  Whan she shal ete, on him is so hir thoght,
  That wel unnethe of mete took she keep;                 135
  And whan that she was to hir reste broght,
  On him she thoghte alwey til that she sleep;
  Whan he was absent, prevely she weep;
  Thus liveth fair Anelida the quene
  For fals Arcite, that did hir al this tene.             140

  This fals Arcite, of his new-fangelnesse,
  For she to him so lowly was and trewe,
  Took lesse deyntee for hir stedfastnesse,
  And saw another lady, proud and newe,
  And right anon he cladde him in hir hewe--              145
  Wot I not whether in whyte, rede, or grene--
  And falsed fair Anelida the quene.

  But never-the-les, gret wonder was hit noon
  Thogh he wer fals, for hit is kinde of man,
  Sith Lamek was, that is so longe agoon,                 150
  To been in love as fals as ever he can;
  He was the firste fader that began
  To loven two, and was in bigamye;
  And he found tentes first, but-if men lye.

  This fals Arcite sumwhat moste he feyne,                155
  Whan he wex fals, to covere his traitorye,
  Right as an hors, that can both byte and pleyne;
  For he bar hir on honde of trecherye,
  And swoor he coude hir doublenesse espye,
  And al was falsnes that she to him mente;               160
  Thus swoor this theef, and forth his way he wente.

  Alas! what herte might enduren hit,
  For routhe or wo, hir sorow for to telle?
  Or what man hath the cunning or the wit?
  Or what man might with-in the chambre dwelle,           165
  If I to him rehersen shal the helle,
  That suffreth fair Anelida the quene
  For fals Arcite, that did hir al this tene?

  She wepeth, waileth, swowneth pitously,
  To grounde deed she falleth as a stoon;                 170
  Al crampissheth hir limes crokedly,
  She speketh as hir wit were al agoon;
  Other colour then asshen hath she noon,
  Noon other word she speketh moche or lyte,
  But 'mercy, cruel herte myn, Arcite!'                   175

  And thus endureth, til that she was so mate
  That she ne hath foot on which she may sustene;
  But forth languisshing ever in this estate,
  Of which Arcite hath nother routhe ne tene;
  His herte was elles-where, newe and grene,              180
  That on hir wo ne deyneth him not to thinke,
  Him rekketh never wher she flete or sinke.

  His newe lady holdeth him so narowe
  Up by the brydel, at the staves ende,
  That every word, he dradde hit as an arowe;             185
  Hir daunger made him bothe bowe and bende,
  And as hir liste, made him turne or wende;
  For she ne graunted him in hir livinge
  No grace, why that he hath lust to singe;

  But drof him forth, unnethe liste hir knowe             190
  That he was servaunt to hir ladyshippe,
  But lest that he wer proude, she held him lowe;
  Thus serveth he, withouten fee or shipe,
  She sent him now to londe, now to shippe;
  And for she yaf him daunger al his fille,               195
  Therfor she had him at hir owne wille.

  Ensample of this, ye thrifty wimmen alle,
  Take here Anelida and fals Arcite,
  That for hir liste him 'dere herte' calle,
  And was so meek, therfor he loved hir lyte;             200
  The kinde of mannes herte is to delyte
  In thing that straunge is, also god me save!
  For what he may not gete, that wolde he have.

  Now turne we to Anelida ageyn,
  That pyneth day by day in languisshing;                 205
  But whan she saw that hir ne gat no geyn,
  Upon a day, ful sorowfully weping,
  She caste hir for to make a compleyning,
  And with hir owne honde she gan hit wryte;
  And sente hit to hir Theban knight Arcite.              210

  THE COMPLEYNT OF ANELIDA THE QUENE UPON FALS ARCITE.

                  _Proem._

  So thirleth with the poynt of remembraunce,
  The swerd of sorowe, y-whet with fals plesaunce,
    Myn herte, bare of blis and blak of hewe,
  That turned is in quaking al my daunce,
  My suretee in a-whaped countenaunce;                    215
    Sith hit availeth not for to ben trewe;
    For who-so trewest is, hit shal hir rewe,
  That serveth love and doth hir observaunce
    Alwey to oon, and chaungeth for no newe.

              (_Strophe._)

  1. I wot my-self as wel as any wight;                   220
  For I loved oon with al my herte and might
    More then my-self, an hundred thousand sythe,
  And called him my hertes lyf, my knight,
  And was al his, as fer as hit was right;
    And whan that he was glad, than was I blythe,         225
    And his disese was my deeth as swythe;
  And he ayein his trouthe me had plight
    For ever-more, his lady me to kythe.

  2. Now is he fals, alas! and causeles,
  And of my wo he is so routheles,                        230
    That with a worde him list not ones deyne
  To bring ayein my sorowful herte in pees,
  For he is caught up in a-nother lees.
    Right as him list, he laugheth at my peyne,
    And I ne can myn herte not restreyne,                 235
  That I ne love him alwey, never-the-les;
    And of al this I not to whom me pleyne.

  3. And shal I pleyne--alas! the harde stounde--
  Un-to my foo that yaf my herte a wounde,
    And yet desyreth that myn harm be more?               240
  Nay, certes! ferther wol I never founde
  Non other help, my sores for to sounde.
    My desteny hath shapen it ful yore;
    I wil non other medecyne ne lore;
  I wil ben ay ther I was ones bounde,                    245
    That I have seid, be seid for ever-more!

  4. Alas! wher is become your gentilesse!
  Your wordes ful of plesaunce and humblesse?
    Your observaunces in so low manere,
  And your awayting and your besinesse                    250
  Upon me, that ye calden your maistresse,
    Your sovereyn lady in this worlde here?
    Alas! and is ther nother word ne chere
  Ye vouchesauf upon myn hevinesse?
    Alas! your love, I bye hit al to dere.                255

  5. Now certes, swete, thogh that ye
    Thus causeles the cause be
    Of my dedly adversitee,
  Your manly reson oghte it to respyte
    To slee your frend, and namely me,                    260
    That never yet in no degree
    Offended yow, as wisly he,
  That al wot, out of wo my soule quyte!

    ? But for I shewed yow, Arcite,
    Al that men wolde to me wryte,                        265
    And was so besy, yow to delyte--
  My honour save--meke, kinde, and free,
    Therfor ye putte on me the wyte,
    And of me recche not a myte,
    Thogh that the swerd of sorow byte                    270
  My woful herte through your crueltee.

  6. My swete foo,    why do ye so,    for shame?
  And thenke ye    that furthered be    your name,
    To love a newe,    and been untrewe?    nay!
  And putte yow    in sclaunder now    and blame,         275
  And do to me    adversitee    and grame,
    That love yow most,    god, wel thou wost!    alway?
    Yet turn ayeyn,    and be al pleyn    som day,
  And than shal this    that now is mis    be game,
    And al for-yive,    whyl that I live    may.          280

              (_Antistrophe._)

  1. Lo! herte myn, al this is for to seyne,
  As whether shal I preye or elles pleyne?
    Whiche is the wey to doon yow to be trewe?
  For either mot I have yow in my cheyne,
  Or with the dethe ye mot departe us tweyne;             285
    Ther ben non other mene weyes newe;
    For god so wisly on my soule rewe,
  As verily ye sleen me with the peyne;
    That may ye see unfeyned of myn hewe.

  2. For thus ferforth have I my deth [y]-soght,          290
  My-self I mordre with my prevy thoght;
    For sorow and routhe of your unkindenesse
  I wepe, I wake, I faste; al helpeth noght;
  I weyve Ioy that is to speke of oght,
    I voyde companye, I flee gladnesse;                   295
    Who may avaunte hir bet of hevinesse
  Then I? and to this plyte have ye me broght,
    Withoute gilt; me nedeth no witnesse.

  3. And sholde I preye, and weyve womanhede?
  Nay! rather deth then do so foul a dede,                300
    And axe mercy gilteles! what nede?
  And if I pleyne what lyf that I lede,
  Yow rekketh not; that know I, out of drede;
    And if I unto yow myn othes bede
    For myn excuse, a scorn shal be my mede;              305
  Your chere floureth, but hit wol not sede;
    Ful longe agoon I oghte have take hede.

  4. For thogh I hadde yow to-morow ageyn,
  I might as wel holde Averill fro reyn,
    As holde yow, to make yow stedfast.                   310
  Almighty god, of trouthe sovereyn,
  Wher is the trouthe of man? who hath hit sleyn?
    Who that hem loveth shal hem fynde as fast
    As in a tempest is a roten mast.
  Is that a tame best that is ay feyn                     315
    To renne away, when he is leest agast?

  5. Now mercy, swete, if I misseye,
    Have I seyd oght amis, I preye?
    I not; my wit is al aweye.
  I fare as doth the song of _Chaunte-pleure_.            320
    For now I pleyne, and now I pleye,
    I am so mased that I deye,
    Arcite hath born awey the keye
  Of al my worlde, and my good aventure!

    ? For in this worlde nis creature                     325
    Wakinge, in more discomfiture
    Then I, ne more sorow endure;
  And if I slepe a furlong wey or tweye,
    Than thinketh me, that your figure
    Before me stant, clad in asure,                       330
    To profren eft a newe assure
  For to be trewe, and mercy me to preye.

  6. The longe night    this wonder sight    I drye,
  And on the day    for this afray    I dye,
    And of al this    right noght, y-wis,    ye recche.   335
  Ne never mo    myn yen two    be drye,
  And to your routhe    and to your trouthe    I crye.
    But welawey!    to fer be they    to fecche;
    Thus holdeth me    my destinee    a wrecche.
  But me to rede    out of this drede    or gye           340
    Ne may my wit,    so weyk is hit,    not strecche.

              _Conclusion._

  Than ende I thus, sith I may do no more,
  I yeve hit up for now and ever-more;
    For I shal never eft putten in balaunce
  My sekernes, ne lerne of love the lore.                 345
  But as the swan, I have herd seyd ful yore,
    Ayeins his deth shal singe in his penaunce,
    So singe I here my destiny or chaunce,
  How that Arcite Anelida so sore
    Hath thirled with the poynt of remembraunce!          350

          _The story continued._

  Whan that Anelida this woful quene
  Hath of hir hande writen in this wyse,
  With face deed, betwixe pale and grene,
  She fel a-swowe; and sith she gan to ryse,
  And unto Mars avoweth sacrifyse                         355
  With-in the temple, with a sorowful chere,
  That shapen was as ye shal after here.                  357
