                        CHILDE HAROLD'S PILGRIMAGE

                             CANTO THE FIRST.


                            TO IANTHE.[h][14]

    Not in those climes where I have late been straying,
      Though Beauty long hath there been matchless deemed,
      Not in those visions to the heart displaying
      Forms which it sighs but to have only dreamed,
      Hath aught like thee in Truth or Fancy seemed:
      Nor, having seen thee, shall I vainly seek
      To paint those charms which varied as they beamed--
      To such as see thee not my words were weak;
    To those who gaze on thee what language could they speak?

    Ah! may'st thou ever be what now thou art,
      Nor unbeseem the promise of thy Spring--
      As fair in form, as warm yet pure in heart,
      Love's image upon earth without his wing,[15]
      And guileless beyond Hope's imagining!
      And surely she who now so fondly rears
      Thy youth, in thee, thus hourly brightening,
      Beholds the Rainbow of her future years,
    Before whose heavenly hues all Sorrow disappears.

    Young Peri of the West!--'tis well for me
      My years already doubly number thine;[16]
      My loveless eye unmoved may gaze on thee,
      And safely view thy ripening beauties shine;
      Happy, I ne'er shall see them in decline;
      Happier, that, while all younger hearts shall bleed,
      Mine shall escape the doom thine eyes assign
      To those whose admiration shall succeed,
    But mixed with pangs to Love's even loveliest hours decreed.

    Oh! let that eye, which, wild as the Gazelle's,
      Now brightly bold or beautifully shy,
      Wins as it wanders, dazzles where it dwells,[17]
      Glance o'er this page, nor to my verse deny
      That smile for which my breast might vainly sigh
      Could I to thee be ever more than friend:
      This much, dear Maid, accord; nor question why
      To one so young my strain I would commend,
    But bid me with my wreath one matchless Lily blend.

    Such is thy name[18] with this my verse entwined;
      And long as kinder eyes a look shall cast[i]
      On Harold's page, Ianthe's here enshrined
      Shall thus be _first_ beheld, forgotten _last_:
      My days once numbered--should this homage past
      Attract thy fairy fingers near the Lyre
      Of him who hailed thee loveliest, as thou wast--
      Such is the most my Memory may desire;
    Though more than Hope can claim, could Friendship less require?[j]

                             CANTO THE FIRST.

                             I.[19]

    Oh, thou! in Hellas deemed of heavenly birth,[k]
      Muse! formed or fabled at the Minstrel's will!
      Since shamed full oft by later lyres on earth,[l][20]
      Mine dares not call thee from thy sacred Hill:
      Yet there I've wandered by thy vaunted rill;[m]
      Yes! sighed o'er Delphi's long deserted shrine,[1.B.]
      Where, save that feeble fountain, all is still;
      Nor mote my shell awake the weary Nine
    To grace so plain a tale--this lowly lay of mine.

                              II.

    Whilome in Albion's isle there dwelt a youth,
      Who ne in Virtue's ways did take delight;
      But spent his days in riot most uncouth,
      And vexed with mirth the drowsy ear of Night.
      Ah me! in sooth he was a shameless wight,
      Sore given to revel and ungodly glee;[n]
      Few earthly things found favour in his sight[o]
      Save concubines and carnal companie,
    And flaunting wassailers of high and low degree.[21]

                              III.

    Childe Harold was he hight:[22]--but whence his name[p]
      And lineage long, it suits me not to say;
      Suffice it, that perchance they were of fame,
      And had been glorious in another day:
      But one sad losel soils a name for ay,[23]
      However mighty in the olden time;
      Nor all that heralds rake from coffined clay,
      Nor florid prose, nor honied lies of rhyme,[q]
    Can blazon evil deeds, or consecrate a crime.

                              IV.

    Childe Harold basked him in the Noontide sun,[r]
      Disporting there like any other fly;
      Nor deemed before his little day was done
      One blast might chill him into misery.
      But long ere scarce a third of his passed by,
      Worse than Adversity the Childe befell;
      He felt the fulness of Satiety:
      Then loathed he in his native land to dwell,
    Which seemed to him more lone than Eremite's sad cell.

                               V.

    For he through Sin's long labyrinth had run,[s]
      Nor made atonement when he did amiss,
      Had sighed to many though he loved but one,[t][24]
      And that loved one, alas! could ne'er be his.
      Ah, happy she! to 'scape from him whose kiss
      Had been pollution unto aught so chaste;
      Who soon had left her charms for vulgar bliss,
      And spoiled her goodly lands to gild his waste,
    Nor calm domestic peace had ever deigned to taste.

                              VI.

    And now Childe Harold was sore sick at heart,[u]
      And from his fellow Bacchanals would flee;
      'Tis said, at times the sullen tear would start,
      But Pride congealed the drop within his ee:[25]
      Apart he stalked in joyless reverie,[v]
      And from his native land resolved to go,
      And visit scorching climes beyond the sea;[26]
      With pleasure drugged, he almost longed for woe,
    And e'en for change of scene would seek the shades below.

                              VII.

    The Childe departed from his father's hall:
      It was a vast and venerable pile;
      So old, it seemed only not to fall,
      Yet strength was pillared in each massy aisle.
      Monastic dome! condemned to uses vile![w]
      Where Superstition once had made her den
      Now Paphian girls were known to sing and smile;[x]
      And monks might deem their time was come agen,[27]
    If ancient tales say true, nor wrong these holy men.

                            VIII.[y]

    Yet oft-times in his maddest mirthful mood
      Strange pangs would flash along Childe Harold's brow,[z]
      As if the Memory of some deadly feud
      Or disappointed passion lurked below:
      But this none knew, nor haply cared to know;
      For his was not that open, artless soul
      That feels relief by bidding sorrow flow,
      Nor sought he friend to counsel or condole,
    Whate'er this grief mote be, which he could not control.

                            IX.[aa]

    And none did love him!--though to hall and bower[28]
      He gathered revellers from far and near,
      He knew them flatterers of the festal hour,
      The heartless Parasites of present cheer.
      Yea! none did love him--not his lemans dear--[ab][29]
      But pomp and power alone are Woman's care,
      And where these are light Eros finds a feere;[30]
      Maidens, like moths, are ever caught by glare,
    And Mammon wins his way where Seraphs might despair.

                               X.

    Childe Harold had a mother--not forgot,[ac]
      Though parting from that mother he did shun;
      A sister whom he loved, but saw her not[31]
      Before his weary pilgrimage begun:
      If friends he had, he bade adieu to none.[ad]
      Yet deem not thence his breast a breast of steel:[ae][32]
      Ye, who have known what 'tis to dote upon
      A few dear objects, will in sadness feel
    Such partings break the heart they fondly hope to heal.

                              XI.

    His house, his home, his heritage, his lands,[af]
      The laughing dames in whom he did delight,[ag]
      Whose large blue eyes, fair locks, and snowy hands,
      Might shake the Saintship of an Anchorite,
      And long had fed his youthful appetite;
      His goblets brimmed with every costly wine,
      And all that mote to luxury invite,
      Without a sigh he left, to cross the brine,
    And traverse Paynim shores, and pass Earth's central line.[ah][33]

                              XII.

    The sails were filled, and fair the light winds blew,[ai]
      As glad to waft him from his native home;
      And fast the white rocks faded from his view,
      And soon were lost in circumambient foam:
      And then, it may be, of his wish to roam
      Repented he, but in his bosom slept[34]
      The silent thought, nor from his lips did come
      One word of wail, whilst others sate and wept,
    And to the reckless gales unmanly moaning kept.

                             XIII.

    But when the Sun was sinking in the sea
      He seized his harp, which he at times could string,
      And strike, albeit with untaught melody,
      When deemed he no strange ear was listening:
      And now his fingers o'er it he did fling,
      And tuned his farewell in the dim twilight;
      While flew the vessel on her snowy wing,
      And fleeting shores receded from his sight,
    Thus to the elements he poured his last "Good Night."[35]


                       CHILDE HAROLD'S GOOD NIGHT.

                               1.

    "Adieu, adieu! my native shore
      Fades o'er the waters blue;
    The night-winds sigh, the breakers roar,
      And shrieks the wild sea-mew.
    Yon Sun that sets upon the sea
      We follow in his flight;
    Farewell awhile to him and thee,
      My native Land--Good Night!

                               2.

    "A few short hours and He will rise
      To give the Morrow birth;
    And I shall hail the main and skies,
      But not my mother Earth.
    Deserted is my own good Hall,
      Its hearth is desolate;
    Wild weeds are gathering on the wall;
      My Dog howls at the gate.

                               3.

    "Come hither, hither, my little page[36]
      Why dost thou weep and wail?
    Or dost thou dread the billows' rage,
      Or tremble at the gale?
    But dash the tear-drop from thine eye;
      Our ship is swift and strong:
    Our fleetest falcon scarce can fly[aj]
      More merrily along."[ak]

                               4.

    "Let winds be shrill, let waves roll high,[al]
      I fear not wave nor wind:
    Yet marvel not, Sir Childe, that I
      Am sorrowful in mind;[37]
    For I have from my father gone,
      A mother whom I love,
    And have no friend, save these alone,
      But thee--and One above.

                               5.

    'My father blessed me fervently,
      Yet did not much complain;
    But sorely will my mother sigh
      Till I come back again.'--
    "Enough, enough, my little lad!
      Such tears become thine eye;
    If I thy guileless bosom had,
      Mine own would not be dry.

                               6.

    "Come hither, hither, my staunch yeoman,[38]
      Why dost thou look so pale?
    Or dost thou dread a French foeman?
      Or shiver at the gale?"--
    'Deem'st thou I tremble for my life?
      Sir Childe, I'm not so weak;
    But thinking on an absent wife
      Will blanch a faithful cheek.

                               7.

    'My spouse and boys dwell near thy hall,
      Along the bordering Lake,
    And when they on their father call,
      What answer shall she make?'--
    "Enough, enough, my yeoman good,[am]
      Thy grief let none gainsay;
    But I, who am of lighter mood,
      Will laugh to flee away.

                               8.

    "For who would trust the seeming sighs[an]
      Of wife or paramour?
    Fresh feeres will dry the bright blue eyes
      We late saw streaming o'er.
    For pleasures past I do not grieve,
      Nor perils gathering near;
    My greatest grief is that I leave
      No thing that claims a tear.[39]

                               9.

    "And now I'm in the world alone,
      Upon the wide, wide sea:
    But why should I for others groan,
      When none will sigh for me?
    Perchance my Dog will whine in vain,
      Till fed by stranger hands;
    But long ere I come back again,
      He'd tear me where he stands.[ao][40]

                              10.

    "With thee, my bark, I'll swiftly go
      Athwart the foaming brine;
    Nor care what land thou bear'st me to,
      So not again to mine.
    Welcome, welcome, ye dark-blue waves!
      And when you fail my sight,
    Welcome, ye deserts, and ye caves!
      My native Land--Good Night!"

                              XIV.

    On, on the vessel flies, the land is gone,
      And winds are rude in Biscay's sleepless bay.
      Four days are sped, but with the fifth, anon,
      New shores descried make every bosom gay;
      And Cintra's mountain[41] greets them on their way,
      And Tagus dashing onward to the Deep,
      His fabled golden tribute[42] bent to pay;
      And soon on board the Lusian pilots leap,
    And steer 'twixt fertile shores where yet few rustics reap.[ap]

                              XV.

    Oh, Christ! it is a goodly sight to see
      What Heaven hath done for this delicious land![aq]
      What fruits of fragrance blush on every tree!
      What goodly prospects o'er the hills expand!
      But man would mar them with an impious hand:
      And when the Almighty lifts his fiercest scourge
      'Gainst those who most transgress his high command,
      With treble vengeance will his hot shafts urge
    Gaul's locust host, and earth from fellest foemen purge[ar]

                              XVI.

    What beauties doth Lisboa[43] first unfold![as]
      Her image floating on that noble tide,
      Which poets vainly pave with sands of gold,[at]
      But now whereon a thousand keels did ride
      Of mighty strength, since Albion was allied,
      And to the Lusians did her aid afford:
      A nation swoln with ignorance and pride,[44]
      Who lick yet loathe the hand that waves the sword[au]
    To save them from the wrath of Gaul's unsparing lord.

                             XVII.

    But whoso entereth within this town,
      That, sheening far, celestial seems to be,
      Disconsolate will wander up and down,
      'Mid many things unsightly to strange ee;[av]
      For hut and palace show like filthily:[aw]
      The dingy denizens are reared in dirt;[ax]
      Ne personage of high or mean degree
      Doth care for cleanness of surtout or shirt,
    Though shent with Egypt's plague, unkempt, unwashed, unhurt.

                             XVIII.

    Poor, paltry slaves! yet born 'midst noblest scenes--
      Why, Nature, waste thy wonders on such men?
      Lo! Cintra's glorious Eden intervenes[45]
      In variegated maze of mount and glen.
      Ah, me! what hand can pencil guide, or pen,
      To follow half on which the eye dilates
      Through views more dazzling unto mortal ken[ay]
      Than those whereof such things the Bard relates,
    Who to the awe-struck world unlocked Elysium's gates.

                              XIX.

    The horrid crags, by toppling convent crowned,[az]
      The cork-trees hoar that clothe the shaggy steep,
      The mountain-moss by scorching skies imbrowned,
      The sunken glen, whose sunless shrubs must weep,
      The tender azure[46] of the unruffled deep,
      The orange tints that gild the greenest bough,
      The torrents that from cliff to valley leap,[ba]
      The vine on high, the willow branch below,
    Mixed in one mighty scene, with varied beauty glow.

                              XX.

    Then slowly climb the many-winding way,
      And frequent turn to linger as you go,
      From loftier rocks new loveliness survey,
      And rest ye at "Our Lady's house of Woe;"[47][2.B.]
      Where frugal monks their little relics show,
      And sundry legends to the stranger tell:
      Here impious men have punished been, and lo!
      Deep in yon cave Honorius long did dwell,
    In hope to merit Heaven by making earth a Hell.

                              XXI.

    And here and there, as up the crags you spring,
      Mark many rude-carved crosses near the path:[48]
      Yet deem not these Devotion's offering--
      These are memorials frail of murderous wrath:
      For wheresoe'er the shrieking victim hath
      Pour'd forth his blood beneath the assassin's knife,
      Some hand erects a cross of mouldering lath;
      And grove and glen with thousand such are rife
    Throughout this purple land, where Law secures not life.[3.B.]

                             XXII.

    On sloping mounds, or in the vale beneath,[49]
      Are domes where whilome kings did make repair;
      But now the wild flowers round them only breathe:
      Yet ruined Splendour still is lingering there.
      And yonder towers the Prince's palace fair:
      There thou too, Vathek! England's wealthiest son,[bb][50]
      Once formed thy Paradise, as not aware
      When wanton Wealth her mightiest deeds hath done,[bc]
    Meek Peace voluptuous lures was ever wont to shun.

                             XXIII.

    Here didst thou dwell, here schemes of pleasure plan,
      Beneath yon mountain's ever beauteous brow:
      But now, as if a thing unblest by Man,[bd]
      Thy fairy dwelling is as lone as Thou!
      Here giant weeds a passage scarce allow
      To Halls deserted, portals gaping wide:
      Fresh lessons to the thinking bosom, how
      Vain are the pleasaunces on earth supplied;[be]
    Swept into wrecks anon by Time's ungentle tide!

                             XXIV.

    Behold the hall where chiefs were late convened![4.B.]
      Oh! dome displeasing unto British eye!
      With diadem hight Foolscap, lo! a Fiend,
      A little Fiend that scoffs incessantly,
      There sits in parchment robe arrayed, and by[bf]
      His side is hung a seal and sable scroll,
      Where blazoned glare names known to chivalry,[bg]
      And sundry signatures adorn the roll,[bh]
    Whereat the Urchin points and laughs with all his soul.[bi]

                              XXV.

    Convention is the dwarfish demon styled[51]
      That foiled the knights in Marialva's dome:
      Of brains (if brains they had) he them beguiled,
      And turned a nation's shallow joy to gloom.
      Here Folly dashed to earth the victor's plume,
      And Policy regained what arms had lost:
      For chiefs like ours in vain may laurels bloom!
      Woe to the conquering, not the conquered host,
    Since baffled Triumph droops on Lusitania's coast.

                             XXVI.

    And ever since that martial Synod met,
      Britannia sickens, Cintra! at thy name;
      And folks in office at the mention fret,[bj]
      And fain would blush, if blush they could, for shame.
      How will Posterity the deed proclaim!
      Will not our own and fellow-nations sneer,
      To view these champions cheated of their fame,
      By foes in fight o'erthrown, yet victors here,
    Where Scorn her finger points through many a coming year?

                             XXVII.

    So deemed the Childe, as o'er the mountains he
      Did take his way in solitary guise:
      Sweet was the scene, yet soon he thought to flee,
      More restless than the swallow in the skies:[bk]
      Though here awhile he learned to moralise,
      For Meditation fixed at times on him;
      And conscious Reason whispered to despise
      His early youth, misspent in maddest whim;
    But as he gazed on truth his aching eyes grew dim.[52]

                            XXVIII.

    To horse! to horse! he quits, for ever quits[53]
      A scene of peace, though soothing to his soul:[bl]
      Again he rouses from his moping fits,
      But seeks not now the harlot and the bowl.[bm]
      Onward he flies, nor fixed as yet the goal
      Where he shall rest him on his pilgrimage;
      And o'er him many changing scenes must roll
      Ere toil his thirst for travel can assuage,[bn]
    Or he shall calm his breast, or learn experience sage.

                             XXIX.

    Yet Mafra shall one moment claim delay,[5.B.]
      Where dwelt of yore the Lusians' luckless queen;[bo][54]
      And Church and Court did mingle their array,
      And Mass and revel were alternate seen;
      Lordlings and freres--ill-sorted fry I ween!
      But here the Babylonian Whore hath built
      A dome, where flaunts she in such glorious sheen,
      That men forget the blood which she hath spilt,
    And bow the knee to Pomp that loves to varnish guilt.

                              XXX.

    O'er vales that teem with fruits, romantic hills,
      (Oh, that such hills upheld a freeborn race!)
      Whereon to gaze the eye with joyaunce fills,
      Childe Harold wends through many a pleasant place.[bp]
      Though sluggards deem it but a foolish chase,
      And marvel men should quit their easy chair,
      The toilsome way, and long, long league to trace,
      Oh! there is sweetness in the mountain air,
    And Life, that bloated Ease can never hope to share.

                             XXXI.

    More bleak to view the hills at length recede,
      And, less luxuriant, smoother vales extend:[bq]
      Immense horizon-bounded plains succeed!
      Far as the eye discerns, withouten end,
      Spain's realms appear whereon her shepherds tend
      Flocks, whose rich fleece right well the trader knows--
      Now must the Pastor's arm his _lambs_ defend:
      For Spain is compassed by unyielding foes,
    And _all_ must shield their _all_, or share Subjection's woes.

                             XXXII.

    Where Lusitania and her Sister meet,
      Deem ye what bounds the rival realms divide?[br]
      Or ere the jealous Queens of Nations greet,
      Doth Tayo interpose his mighty tide?
      Or dark Sierras rise in craggy pride?
      Or fence of art, like China's vasty wall?--
      Ne barrier wall, ne river deep and wide,
      Ne horrid crags, nor mountains dark and tall,
    Rise like the rocks that part Hispania's land from Gaul:[55]

                            XXXIII.

    But these between a silver streamlet[56] glides,
      And scarce a name distinguisheth the brook,
      Though rival kingdoms press its verdant sides:
      Here leans the idle shepherd on his crook,
      And vacant on the rippling waves doth look,
      That peaceful still 'twixt bitterest foemen flow;
      For proud each peasant as the noblest duke:
      Well doth the Spanish hind the difference know
    'Twixt him and Lusian slave, the lowest of the low.[6.B.]

                             XXXIV.

    But ere the mingling bounds have far been passed,[bs]
      Dark Guadiana rolls his power along
      In sullen billows, murmuring and vast,
      So noted ancient roundelays among.[bt]
      Whilome upon his banks did legions throng
      Of Moor and Knight, in mailed splendour drest:
      Here ceased the swift their race, here sunk the strong;
      The Paynim turban and the Christian crest
    Mixed on the bleeding stream, by floating hosts oppressed.[57]

                             XXXV.

    Oh, lovely Spain! renowned, romantic Land!
      Where is that standard[58] which Pelagio bore,[bu]
      When Cava's traitor-sire first called the band
      That dyed thy mountain streams with Gothic gore?[7.B.]
      Where are those bloody Banners which of yore
      Waved o'er thy sons, victorious to the gale,
      And drove at last the spoilers to their shore?[59]
      Red gleamed the Cross, and waned the Crescent pale,[bv]
    While Afric's echoes thrilled with Moorish matrons' wail.

                             XXXVI.

    Teems not each ditty with the glorious tale?[60]
      Ah! such, alas! the hero's amplest fate!
      When granite moulders and when records fail,
      A peasant's plaint prolongs his dubious date.[bw]
      Pride! bend thine eye from Heaven to thine estate,
      See how the Mighty shrink into a song!
      Can Volume, Pillar, Pile preserve thee great?
      Or must thou trust Tradition's simple tongue,
    When Flattery sleeps with thee, and History does thee wrong?

                            XXXVII.

    Awake, ye Sons of Spain! awake! advance!
      Lo! Chivalry, your ancient Goddess, cries,
      But wields not, as of old, her thirsty lance,
      Nor shakes her crimson plumage in the skies:
      Now on the smoke of blazing bolts she flies,
      And speaks in thunder through yon engine's roar:
      In every peal she calls--"Awake! arise!"
      Say, is her voice more feeble than of yore,
    When her war-song was heard on Andalusia's shore?

                            XXXVIII.

    Hark!--heard you not those hoofs of dreadful note?
      Sounds not the clang of conflict on the heath?
      Saw ye not whom the reeking sabre smote,
      Nor saved your brethren ere they sank beneath
      Tyrants and Tyrants' slaves?--the fires of Death,
      The Bale-fires flash on high:--from rock to rock![bx]
      Each volley tells that thousands cease to breathe;
      Death rides upon the sulphury Siroc,[61]
    Red Battle stamps his foot, and Nations feel the shock.

                             XXXIX.

    Lo! where the Giant on the mountain stands,
      His blood-red tresses deepening in the Sun,
      With death-shot glowing in his fiery hands,
      And eye that scorcheth all it glares upon;
      Restless it rolls, now fixed, and now anon
      Flashing afar,--and at his iron feet
      Destruction cowers, to mark what deeds are done;
      For on this morn three potent Nations meet,
    To shed before his Shrine the blood he deems most sweet.

                              XL.

    By Heaven! it is a splendid sight to see[62]
      (For one who hath no friend, no brother there)
      Their rival scarfs of mixed embroidery,[by]
      Their various arms that glitter in the air!
      What gallant War-hounds rouse them from their lair,
      And gnash their fangs, loud yelling for the prey!
      All join the chase, but few the triumph share;[63]
      The Grave shall bear the chiefest prize away,
    And Havoc scarce for joy can number their array.

                              XLI.

    Three hosts combine to offer sacrifice;
      Three tongues prefer strange orisons on high;
      Three gaudy standards flout the pale blue skies;[64]
      The shouts are France, Spain, Albion, Victory!
      The Foe, the Victim, and the fond Ally
      That fights for all, but ever fights in vain,[65]
      Are met--as if at home they could not die--
      To feed the crow on Talavera's plain,
    And fertilise the field that each pretends to gain.

                             XLII.

    There shall they rot--Ambition's honoured fools![bz]
      Yes, Honour decks the turf that wraps their clay![66]
      Vain Sophistry! in these behold the tools,[ca]
      The broken tools, that Tyrants cast away
      By myriads, when they dare to pave their way
      With human hearts--to what?--a dream alone.
      Can Despots compass aught that hails their sway?[cb]
      Or call with truth one span of earth their own,
    Save that wherein at last they crumble bone by bone?

                             XLIII.

    Oh, Albuera! glorious field of grief![cc][67]
      As o'er thy plain the Pilgrim pricked his steed,
      Who could foresee thee, in a space so brief,
      A scene where mingling foes should boast and bleed![cd]
      Peace to the perished! may the warrior's meed[ce]
      And tears of triumph their reward prolong![cf]
      Till others fall where other chieftains lead
      Thy name shall circle round the gaping throng,
    And shine in worthless lays, the theme of transient song.[cg][68]

                             XLIV.

    Enough of Battle's minions! let them play
      Their game of lives, and barter breath for fame:
      Fame that will scarce reanimate their clay,
      Though thousands fall to deck some single name.
      In sooth 'twere sad to thwart their noble aim
      Who strike, blest hirelings! for their country's good,[ch]
      And die, that living might have proved her shame;
      Perished, perchance, in some domestic feud,
    Or in a narrower sphere wild Rapine's path pursued.[ci]

                              XLV.

    Full swiftly Harold wends his lonely way[cj][69]
      Where proud Sevilla triumphs unsubdued:[ck]
      Yet is she free? the Spoiler's wished-for prey!
      Soon, soon shall Conquest's fiery foot intrude,
      Blackening her lovely domes with traces rude.
      Inevitable hour! 'Gainst fate to strive
      Where Desolation plants her famished brood
      Is vain, or Ilion, Tyre might yet survive,
    And Virtue vanquish all, and Murder cease to thrive

                             XLVI.

    But all unconscious of the coming doom,[70]
      The feast, the song, the revel here abounds;
      Strange modes of merriment the hours consume,
      Nor bleed these patriots with their country's wounds:
      Nor here War's clarion, but Love's rebeck[71] sounds;[cl]
      Here Folly still his votaries inthralls;
      And young-eyed Lewdness walks her midnight rounds:[cm]
      Girt with the silent crimes of Capitals,
    Still to the last kind Vice clings to the tott'ring walls.

                             XLVII.

    Not so the rustic--with his trembling mate
      He lurks, nor casts his heavy eye afar,
      Lest he should view his vineyard desolate,
      Blasted below the dun hot breath of War.
      No more beneath soft Eve's consenting star
      Fandango twirls his jocund castanet:[72]
      Ah, Monarchs! could ye taste the mirth ye mar,
      Not in the toils of Glory would ye fret;[cn]
    The hoarse dull drum would sleep, and Man be happy yet!

                            XLVIII.

    How carols now the lusty muleteer?
      Of Love, Romance, Devotion is his lay,
      As whilome he was wont the leagues to cheer,
      His quick bells wildly jingling on the way?
      No! as he speeds, he chants "Viv? el Rey!"[8.B.]
      And checks his song to execrate Godoy,
      The royal wittol Charles, and curse the day
      When first Spain's queen beheld the black-eyed boy,
    And gore-faced Treason sprung from her adulterate joy.

                             XLIX.

    On yon long level plain, at distance crowned[73]
      With crags, whereon those Moorish turrets rest,
      Wide-scattered hoof-marks dint the wounded ground;
      And, scathed by fire, the greensward's darkened vest
      Tells that the foe was Andalusia's guest:
      Here was the camp, the watch-flame, and the host,
      Here the bold peasant stormed the Dragon's nest;
      Still does he mark it with triumphant boast,
    And points to yonder cliffs, which oft were won and lost.

                               L.

    And whomsoe'er along the path you meet
      Bears in his cap the badge of crimson hue,
      Which tells you whom to shun and whom to greet:[9.B.]
      Woe to the man that walks in public view
      Without of loyalty this token true:
      Sharp is the knife, and sudden is the stroke;
      And sorely would the Gallic foeman rue,
      If subtle poniards, wrapt beneath the cloke,
    Could blunt the sabre's edge, or clear the cannon's smoke.

                              LI.

    At every turn Morena's dusky height[74]
      Sustains aloft the battery's iron load;
      And, far as mortal eye can compass sight,
      The mountain-howitzer, the broken road,
      The bristling palisade, the fosse o'erflowed,
      The stationed bands, the never-vacant watch,[co]
      The magazine in rocky durance stowed,
      The bolstered steed beneath the shed of thatch,
    The ball-piled pyramid, the ever-blazing match,[10.B.]

                              LII.

    Portend the deeds to come:--but he whose nod
      Has tumbled feebler despots from their sway,
      A moment pauseth ere he lifts the rod;
      A little moment deigneth to delay:
      Soon will his legions sweep through these their way;
      The West must own the Scourger of the world.[cp]
      Ah! Spain! how sad will be thy reckoning-day,
      When soars Gaul's Vulture, with his wings unfurled,[cq]
    And thou shall view thy sons in crowds to Hades hurled.

                             LIII.

    And must they fall? the young, the proud, the brave,
      To swell one bloated Chiefs unwholesome reign?[75]
      No step between submission and a grave?
      The rise of Rapine and the fall of Spain?
      And doth the Power that man adores ordain
      Their doom, nor heed the suppliant's appeal?
      Is all that desperate Valour acts in vain?
      And Counsel sage, and patriotic Zeal--
    The Veteran's skill--Youth's fire--and Manhood's heart of steel?

                              LIV.

    Is it for this the Spanish maid, aroused,
      Hangs on the willow her unstrung guitar,
      And, all unsexed, the Anlace[76] hath espoused,
      Sung the loud song, and dared the deed of war?
      And she, whom once the semblance of a scar
      Appalled, an owlet's 'larum chilled with dread,[77]
      Now views the column-scattering bay'net jar,[cr]
      The falchion flash, and o'er the yet warm dead
    Stalks with Minerva's step where Mars might quake to tread.

                              LV.

    Ye who shall marvel when you hear her tale,
      Oh! had you known her in her softer hour,
      Marked her black eye that mocks her coal-black veil,
      Heard her light, lively tones in Lady's bower,
      Seen her long locks that foil the painter's power,
      Her fairy form, with more than female grace,
      Scarce would you deem that Saragoza's tower
      Beheld her smile in Danger's Gorgon face,
    Thin the closed ranks, and lead in Glory's fearful chase.

                              LVI.

    Her lover sinks--she sheds no ill-timed tear;
      Her Chief is slain--she fills his fatal post;
      Her fellows flee--she checks their base career;
      The Foe retires--she heads the sallying host:
      Who can appease like her a lover's ghost?
      Who can avenge so well a leader's fall?
      What maid retrieve when man's flushed hope is lost?
      Who hang so fiercely on the flying Gaul,
    Foiled by a woman's hand, before a battered wall?[11.B.]

                             LVII.

    Yet are Spain's maids no race of Amazons,
      But formed for all the witching arts of love:
      Though thus in arms they emulate her sons,
      And in the horrid phalanx dare to move,
      'Tis but the tender fierceness of the dove,
      Pecking the hand that hovers o'er her mate:
      In softness as in firmness far above
      Remoter females, famed for sickening prate;
    Her mind is nobler sure, her charms perchance as great.

                             LVIII.

    The seal Love's dimpling finger hath impressed[cs]
      Denotes how soft that chin which bears his touch:[12.B.]
      Her lips, whose kisses pout to leave their nest,
      Bid man be valiant ere he merit such:
      Her glance how wildly beautiful! how much
      Hath Phoebus wooed in vain to spoil her cheek,
      Which glows yet smoother from his amorous clutch!
      Who round the North for paler dames would seek?
    How poor their forms appear! how languid, wan, and weak![78]

                              LIX.

    Match me, ye climes! which poets love to laud;
      Match me, ye harems of the land! where now
      I strike my strain, far distant, to applaud
      Beauties that ev'n a cynic must avow;[ct]
      Match me those Houries, whom ye scarce allow
      To taste the gale lest Love should ride the wind,
      With Spain's dark-glancing daughters--deign to know,
      There your wise Prophet's Paradise we find,
    His black-eyed maids of Heaven, angelically kind.

                              LX.

    Oh, thou Parnassus! whom I now survey,[79][13.B.]
      Not in the phrensy of a dreamer's eye,
      Not in the fabled landscape of a lay,[cu]
      But soaring snow-clad through thy native sky,
      In the wild pomp of mountain-majesty!
      What marvel if I thus essay to sing?
      The humblest of thy pilgrims passing by
      Would gladly woo thine Echoes with his string,
    Though from thy heights no more one Muse will wave her wing.

                              LXI.

    Oft have I dreamed of Thee! whose glorious name
      Who knows not, knows not man's divinest lore:
      And now I view thee--'tis, alas, with shame
      That I in feeblest accents must adore.
      When I recount thy worshippers of yore
      I tremble, and can only bend the knee;
      Nor raise my voice, nor vainly dare to soar,
      But gaze beneath thy cloudy canopy
    In silent joy to think at last I look on Thee![80]

                             LXII.

    Happier in this than mightiest Bards have been,
      Whose Fate to distant homes confined their lot,
      Shall I unmoved behold the hallowed scene,
      Which others rave of, though they know it not?
      Though here no more Apollo haunts his Grot,
      And thou, the Muses' seat, art now their grave,
      Some gentle Spirit still pervades the spot,
      Sighs in the gale, keeps silence in the Cave,
    And glides with glassy foot o'er yon melodious wave.[cv]

                             LXIII.

    Of thee hereafter.--Ev'n amidst my strain
      I turned aside to pay my homage here;
      Forgot the land, the sons, the maids of Spain;
      Her fate, to every freeborn bosom dear;
      And hailed thee, not perchance without a tear.
      Now to my theme--but from thy holy haunt
      Let me some remnant, some memorial bear;[cw]
      Yield me one leaf of Daphne's deathless plant,
    Nor let thy votary's hope be deemed an idle vaunt.

                             LXIV.

    But ne'er didst thou, fair Mount! when Greece was young,
      See round thy giant base a brighter choir,[81]
      Nor e'er did Delphi, when her Priestess sung
      The Pythian hymn with more than mortal fire,
      Behold a train more fitting to inspire
      The song of love, than Andalusia's maids,
      Nurst in the glowing lap of soft Desire:
      Ah! that to these were given such peaceful shades
    As Greece can still bestow, though Glory fly her glades.

    Fair is proud Seville; let her country boast
      Her strength, her wealth, her site of ancient days;[14.B.]
      But Cadiz, rising on the distant coast,[82]
      Calls forth a sweeter, though ignoble praise.
      Ah, Vice! how soft are thy voluptuous ways!
      While boyish blood is mantling, who can 'scape[cx]
      The fascination of thy magic gaze?
      A Cherub-Hydra round us dost thou gape,
    And mould to every taste thy dear delusive shape.

                             LXVI.

    When Paphos fell by Time--accursed Time!
      The Queen who conquers all must yield to thee--
      The Pleasures fled, but sought as warm a clime;
      And Venus, constant to her native Sea,
      To nought else constant, hither deigned to flee,
      And fixed her shrine within these walls of white:
      Though not to one dome circumscribeth She
      Her worship, but, devoted to her rite,
    A thousand Altars rise, for ever blazing bright.[83]

                             LXVII.

    From morn till night, from night till startled Morn[84]
      Peeps blushing on the Revel's laughing crew,
      The Song is heard, the rosy Garland worn;
      Devices quaint, and Frolics ever new,
      Tread on each other's kibes.[85] A long adieu
      He bids to sober joy that here sojourns:
      Nought interrupts the riot, though in lieu[cy]
      Of true devotion monkish incense burns,
    And Love and Prayer unite, or rule the hour by turns.[cz]

                            LXVIII.

    The Sabbath comes, a day of blessed rest:
      What hallows it upon this Christian shore?
      Lo! it is sacred to a solemn Feast:
      Hark! heard you not the forest-monarch's roar?
      Crashing the lance, he snuffs the spouting gore
      Of man and steed, o'erthrown beneath his horn;
      The thronged arena shakes with shouts for more;
      Yells the mad crowd o'er entrails freshly torn,
    Nor shrinks the female eye, nor ev'n affects to mourn.

                           LXIX.[86]

    The seventh day this--the Jubilee of man!
      London! right well thou know'st the day of prayer:
      Then thy spruce citizen, washed artisan,
      And smug apprentice gulp their weekly air:
      Thy coach of hackney, whiskey,[87] one-horse chair,
      And humblest gig through sundry suburbs whirl,[da]
      To Hampstead, Brentford, Harrow make repair;
      Till the tired jade the wheel forgets to hurl,
    Provoking envious gibe from each pedestrian churl.[db]

      Ask ye, Boeotian Shades! the reason why?[15.B.]
      'Tis to the worship of the solemn Horn,[88]
      Grasped in the holy hand of Mystery,
      In whose dread name both men and maids are sworn,

    All have their fooleries--not alike are thine,
      Fair Cadiz, rising o'er the dark blue sea![89]
      Soon as the Matin bell proclaimeth nine,
      Thy Saint-adorers count the Rosary:
      Much is the VIRGIN teased to shrive them free
      (Well do I ween the only virgin there)
      From crimes as numerous as her beadsmen be;
      Then to the crowded circus forth they fare:
    Young, old, high, low, at once the same diversion share.

                             LXXII.

    The lists are oped, the spacious area cleared,[90]
      Thousands on thousands piled are seated round;
      Long ere the first loud trumpet's note is heard,
      Ne vacant space for lated wight is found:
      Here Dons, Grandees, but chiefly Dames abound,
      Skilled in the ogle of a roguish eye,
      Yet ever well inclined to heal the wound;
      None through their cold disdain are doomed to die,
    As moon-struck bards complain, by Love's sad archery.

                            LXXIII.

    Hushed is the din of tongues--on gallant steeds,
      With milk-white crest, gold spur, and light-poised lance,
      Four cavaliers prepare for venturous deeds,
      And lowly-bending to the lists advance;
      Rich are their scarfs, their chargers featly prance:
      If in the dangerous game they shine to-day,
      The crowd's loud shout and ladies' lovely glance,
      Best prize of better acts! they bear away,
    And all that kings or chiefs e'er gain their toils repay.

                             LXXIV.

    In costly sheen and gaudy cloak arrayed.
      But all afoot, the light-limbed Matadore
      Stands in the centre, eager to invade
      The lord of lowing herds; but not before
      The ground, with cautious tread, is traversed o'er,
      Lest aught unseen should lurk to thwart his speed:
      His arms a dart, he fights aloof, nor more
      Can Man achieve without the friendly steed--
    Alas! too oft condemned for him to bear and bleed.

                             LXXV.

    Thrice sounds the Clarion; lo! the signal falls,
      The den expands, and Expectation mute
      Gapes round the silent circle's peopled walls.
      Bounds with one lashing spring the mighty brute,
      And, wildly staring, spurns, with sounding foot,
      The sand, nor blindly rushes on his foe:
      Here, there, he points his threatening front, to suit
      His first attack, wide-waving to and fro
    His angry tail; red rolls his eye's dilated glow.

                             LXXVI.

    Sudden he stops--his eye is fixed--away--
      Away, thou heedless boy! prepare the spear:
      Now is thy time, to perish, or display
      The skill that yet may check his mad career!
      With well-timed croupe[91] the nimble coursers veer;
      On foams the Bull, but not unscathed he goes;
      Streams from his flank the crimson torrent clear:
      He flies, he wheels, distracted with his throes;
    Dart follows dart--lance, lance--loud bellowings speak his woes.

                            LXXVII.

    Again he comes; nor dart nor lance avail,
      Nor the wild plunging of the tortured horse;
      Though Man and Man's avenging arms assail,
      Vain are his weapons, vainer is his force.
      One gallant steed is stretched a mangled corse;
      Another, hideous sight! unseamed appears,
      His gory chest unveils life's panting source;
      Though death-struck, still his feeble frame he rears;
    Staggering, but stemming all, his Lord unharmed he bears.

                            LXXVIII.

    Foiled, bleeding, breathless, furious to the last,
      Full in the centre stands the Bull at bay,
      Mid wounds, and clinging darts, and lances brast,[92]
      And foes disabled in the brutal fray:
      And now the Matadores[93] around him play,
      Shake the red cloak, and poise the ready brand:
      Once more through all he bursts his thundering way--
      Vain rage! the mantle quits the conynge hand,
    Wraps his fierce eye--'tis past--he sinks upon the sand![dd]

                             LXXIX.

    Where his vast neck just mingles with the spine,
      Sheathed in his form the deadly weapon lies.
      He stops--he starts--disdaining to decline:
      Slowly he falls, amidst triumphant cries,
      Without a groan, without a struggle dies.
      The decorated car appears--on high
      The corse is piled--sweet sight for vulgar eyes--[de][94]
      Four steeds that spurn the rein, as swift as shy,
    Hurl the dark bulk along, scarce seen in dashing by.

                             LXXX.

    Such the ungentle sport that oft invites
      The Spanish maid, and cheers the Spanish swain.
      Nurtured in blood betimes, his heart delights
      In vengeance, gloating on another's pain.
      What private feuds the troubled village stain!
      Though now one phalanxed host should meet the foe,
      Enough, alas! in humble homes remain,
      To meditate 'gainst friend the secret blow,
   For some slight cause of wrath, whence Life's warm stream must flow.[95]

                             LXXXI.

    But Jealousy has fled: his bars, his bolts,
      His withered Centinel,[96] Duenna sage!
      And all whereat the generous soul revolts,[df]
      Which the stern dotard deemed he could encage,
      Have passed to darkness with the vanished age.
      Who late so free as Spanish girls were seen,
      (Ere War uprose in his volcanic rage,)
      With braided tresses bounding o'er the green,
    While on the gay dance shone Night's lover-loving Queen?

                            LXXXII.

    Oh! many a time and oft, had Harold loved,
      Or dreamed he loved, since Rapture is a dream;
      But now his wayward bosom was unmoved,
      For not yet had he drunk of Lethe's stream;
      And lately had he learned with truth to deem
      Love has no gift so grateful as his wings:
      How fair, how young, how soft soe'er he seem,
      Full from the fount of Joy's delicious springs[dg]
    Some bitter o'er the flowers its bubbling venom flings.[16.B.]

                            LXXXIII.

    Yet to the beauteous form he was not blind,
      Though now it moved him as it moves the wise;
      Not that Philosophy on such a mind
      E'er deigned to bend her chastely-awful eyes:
      But Passion raves herself[97] to rest, or flies;
      And Vice, that digs her own voluptuous tomb,
      Had buried long his hopes, no more to rise:[dh]
      Pleasure's palled Victim! life-abhorring Gloom
    Wrote on his faded brow curst Cain's unresting doom.[98]

                            LXXXIV.

    Still he beheld, nor mingled with the throng;
      But viewed them not with misanthropic hate:
      Fain would he now have joined the dance, the song;
      But who may smile that sinks beneath his fate?
      Nought that he saw his sadness could abate:
      Yet once he struggled 'gainst the Demon's sway,
      And as in Beauty's bower he pensive sate,
      Poured forth his unpremeditated lay,
    To charms as fair as those that soothed his happier day.


                               TO INEZ.[99]

                               1.

    Nay, smile not at my sullen brow;
      Alas! I cannot smile again:
    Yet Heaven avert that ever thou
      Shouldst weep, and haply weep in vain.

                               2.

    And dost thou ask what secret woe
      I bear, corroding Joy and Youth?
    And wilt thou vainly seek to know
      A pang, ev'n thou must fail to soothe?

                               3.

    It is not love, it is not hate,
      Nor low Ambition's honours lost,
    That bids me loathe my present state,
      And fly from all I prized the most:

                               4.

    It is that weariness which springs
      From all I meet, or hear, or see:
    To me no pleasure Beauty brings;
      Thine eyes have scarce a charm for me.

                               5.

    It is that settled, ceaseless gloom
      The fabled Hebrew Wanderer bore;
    That will not look beyond the tomb,
      But cannot hope for rest before.

                               6.

    What Exile from himself can flee?[100]
      To zones though more and more remote,[di]
    Still, still pursues, where'er I be,
      The blight of Life--the Demon Thought.[101]

                               7.

    Yet others rapt in pleasure seem,
      And taste of all that I forsake;
    Oh! may they still of transport dream,
      And ne'er--at least like me--awake!

                               8.

    Through many a clime 'tis mine to go,
      With many a retrospection curst;
    And all my solace is to know,
      Whate'er betides, I've known the worst.

                               9.

    What is that worst? Nay do not ask--
      In pity from the search forbear:
    Smile on--nor venture to unmask
      Man's heart, and view the Hell that's there.

                                                   Jan. 25. 1810.--[MS.]


                             LXXXV.

    Adieu, fair Cadiz! yea, a long adieu!
      Who may forget how well thy walls have stood?
      When all were changing thou alone wert true,
      First to be free and last to be subdued;[102]
      And if amidst a scene, a shock so rude,
      Some native blood was seen thy streets to dye,
      A Traitor only fell beneath the feud: [17.B.]
      Here all were noble, save Nobility;
    None hugged a Conqueror's chain, save fallen Chivalry!

                            LXXXVI.

    Such be the sons of Spain, and strange her Fate!
      They fight for Freedom who were never free,
      A Kingless people for a nerveless state;[103]
      Her vassals combat when their Chieftains flee,
      True to the veriest slaves of Treachery:
      Fond of a land which gave them nought but life,
      Pride points the path that leads to Liberty;
      Back to the struggle, baffled in the strife,
    War, war is still the cry, "War even to the knife!"[18.B.]

                            LXXXVII.

    Ye, who would more of Spain and Spaniards know[dj]
      Go, read whate'er is writ of bloodiest strife:
      Whate'er keen Vengeance urged on foreign foe
      Can act, is acting there against man's life:
      From flashing scimitar to secret knife,
      War mouldeth there each weapon to his need--
      So may he guard the sister and the wife,
      So may he make each curst oppressor bleed--
    So may such foes deserve the most remorseless deed!

                         LXXXVIII.[104]

    Flows there a tear of Pity for the dead?
      Look o'er the ravage of the reeking plain;
      Look on the hands with female slaughter red;
      Then to the dogs resign the unburied slain,
      Then to the vulture let each corse remain,
      Albeit unworthy of the prey-bird's maw;
      Let their bleached bones, and blood's unbleaching stain,
      Long mark the battle-field with hideous awe:
    Thus only may our sons conceive the scenes we saw!

                            LXXXIX.

    Nor yet, alas! the dreadful work is done;
      Fresh legions pour adown the Pyrenees:
      It deepens still, the work is scarce begun,
      Nor mortal eye the distant end foresees.
      Fall'n nations gaze on Spain; if freed, she frees
      More than her fell Pizarros once enchained:
      Strange retribution! now Columbia's ease
      Repairs the wrongs that Quito's sons sustained,[105]
    While o'er the parent clime prowls Murder unrestrained.

                              XC.

    Not all the blood at Talavera shed,
      Not all the marvels of Barossa's fight,
      Not Albuera lavish of the dead,
      Have won for Spain her well asserted right.
      When shall her Olive-Branch be free from blight?
      When shall she breathe her from the blushing toil?
      How many a doubtful day shall sink in night,
      Ere the Frank robber turn him from his spoil,
    And Freedom's stranger-tree grow native of the soil![106]

                              XCI.

    And thou, my friend!--since unavailing woe[dk][107][19.B.]
      Bursts from my heart, and mingles with the strain--
     Had the sword laid thee with the mighty low,
      Pride might forbid e'en Friendship to complain:
      But thus unlaurelled to descend in vain,
      By all forgotten, save the lonely breast,
      And mix unbleeding with the boasted slain,
      While Glory crowns so many a meaner crest!
    What hadst thou done to sink so peacefully to rest?

                             XCII.

    Oh, known the earliest, and esteemed the most![dl][108]
      Dear to a heart where nought was left so dear![dm]
      Though to my hopeless days for ever lost,
      In dreams deny me not to see thee here!
      And Morn in secret shall renew the tear
      Of Consciousness awaking to her woes,
      And Fancy hover o'er thy bloodless bier,[dn]
      Till my frail frame return to whence it rose,
    And mourned and mourner lie united in repose.

                             XCIII.

    Here is one fytte[109] of Harold's pilgrimage:
      Ye who of him may further seek to know,
      Shall find some tidings in a future page,
      If he that rhymeth now may scribble moe.
      Is this too much? stern Critic! say not so:
      Patience! and ye shall hear what he beheld
      In other lands, where he was doomed to go:
      Lands that contain the monuments of Eld,
    Ere Greece and Grecian arts by barbarous hands were quelled.

                             CANTO THE SECOND

                            I.[113]

    Come, blue-eyed Maid of Heaven!--but Thou, alas!
      Didst never yet one mortal song inspire--
      Goddess of Wisdom! here thy temple was,
      And is, despite of War and wasting fire,[1.B.]
      And years, that bade thy worship to expire:
      But worse than steel, and flame, and ages slow,[2.B.]
      Is the dread sceptre and dominion dire
      Of men who never felt the sacred glow
    That thoughts of thee and thine on polished breasts bestow.

                              II.

    Ancient of days! august Athena! where,[do]
      Where are thy men of might? thy grand in soul?
      Gone--glimmering through the dream of things that were:[dp]
      First in the race that led to Glory's goal,
      They won, and passed away--is this the whole?
      A schoolboy's tale, the wonder of an hour!
      The Warrior's weapon and the Sophist's stole[114]
      Are sought in vain, and o'er each mouldering tower,
    Dim with the mist of years, gray flits the shade of power.[dq]

                              III.

    Son of the Morning, rise! approach you here!
      Come--but molest not yon defenceless Urn:
      Look on this spot--a Nation's sepulchre!
      Abode of Gods, whose shrines no longer burn.[dr]
      Even Gods must yield--Religions take their turn:
      'Twas Jove's--'tis Mahomet's--and other Creeds
      Will rise with other years, till Man shall learn
      Vainly his incense soars, his victim bleeds;
    Poor child of Doubt and Death, whose hope is built on reeds.[ds]

                              IV.

    Bound to the Earth, he lifts his eye to Heaven--
      Is't not enough, Unhappy Thing! to know
      Thou art? Is this a boon so kindly given,
      That being, thou would'st be again, and go,
      Thou know'st not, reck'st not to what region, so[115]
      On Earth no more, but mingled with the skies?
      Still wilt thou dream on future Joy and Woe?[dt]
      Regard and weigh yon dust before it flies:
    That little urn saith more than thousand Homilies.

                               V.

    Or burst the vanished Hero's lofty mound;
      Far on the solitary shore he sleeps:[3.B.]
      He fell, and falling nations mourned around;
      But now not one of saddening thousands weeps,
      Nor warlike worshipper his vigil keeps
      Where demi-gods appeared, as records tell.[du][116]
      Remove yon skull from out the scattered heaps:
      Is that a Temple where a God may dwell?
    Why ev'n the Worm at last disdains her shattered cell!

                              VI.

    Look on its broken arch, its ruined wall,
      Its chambers desolate, and portals foul:
      Yes, this was once Ambition's airy hall,
      The Dome of Thought, the Palace of the Soul:
      Behold through each lack-lustre, eyeless hole,
      The gay recess of Wisdom and of Wit[117]
      And Passion's host, that never brooked control:
      Can all Saint, Sage, or Sophist ever writ,
    People this lonely tower, this tenement refit?

                              VII.

    Well didst thou speak, Athena's wisest son![118]
      "All that we know is, nothing can be known."
      Why should we shrink from what we cannot shun?
      Each hath its pang, but feeble sufferers groan
      With brain-born dreams of Evil all their own.
      Pursue what Chance or Fate proclaimeth best;
      Peace waits us on the shores of Acheron:
      There no forced banquet claims the sated guest,
    But Silence spreads the couch of ever welcome Rest.

                           VIII.[119]

    Yet if, as holiest men have deemed, there be[dv]
      A land of Souls beyond that sable shore,
      To shame the Doctrine of the Sadducee
      And Sophists, madly vain of dubious lore;
      How sweet it were in concert to adore
      With those who made our mortal labours light!
      To hear each voice we feared to hear no more!
      Behold each mighty shade revealed to sight,
    The Bactrian, Samian sage, and all who taught the Right!

                            IX.[120]

    There, Thou!--whose Love and Life together fled,
      Have left me here to love and live in vain--
      Twined with my heart, and can I deem thee dead
      When busy Memory flashes on my brain?
      Well--I will dream that we may meet again,
      And woo the vision to my vacant breast:
      If aught of young Remembrance then remain,
      Be as it may Futurity's behest,[dw]
    For me 'twere bliss enough to know thy spirit blest!

                               X.

    Here let me sit upon this massy stone,
      The marble column's yet unshaken base;
      Here, son of Saturn! was thy favourite throne:[4.B.]
      Mightiest of many such! Hence let me trace
      The latent grandeur of thy dwelling-place.
      It may not be: nor ev'n can Fancy's eye
      Restore what Time hath laboured to deface.
      Yet these proud Pillars claim no passing sigh;
    Unmoved the Moslem sits, the light Greek carols by.

                              XI.

    But who, of all the plunderers of yon Fane[121]
      On high--where Pallas linger'd, loth to flee
      The latest relic of her ancient reign--
      The last, the worst, dull spoiler, who was he?[dx]
      Blush, Caledonia! such thy son could be!
      England! I joy no child he was of thine:
      Thy free-born men should spare what once was free;
      Yet they could violate each saddening shrine,
    And hear these altars o'er the long-reluctant brine.[5.B.]

                              XII.

    But most the modern Pict's ignoble boast,[dy][122]
      To rive what Goth, and Turk, and Time hath spared:[6.B.]
      Cold as the crags upon his native coast,
      His mind as barren and his heart as hard,
      Is he whose head conceived, whose hand prepared.
      Aught to displace Athenae's poor remains:
      Her Sons too weak the sacred shrine to guard,
      Yet felt some portion of their Mother's pains,[7.B.]
    And never knew, till then, the weight of Despot's chains.

                             XIII.

    What! shall it e'er be said by British tongue,[dz]
      Albion was happy in Athena's tears?
      Though in thy name the slaves her bosom wrung,
      Tell not the deed to blushing Europe's ears;
      The Ocean Queen, the free Britannia, bears
      The last poor plunder from a bleeding land:
      Yes, she, whose generous aid her name endears,
      Tore down those remnants with a Harpy's hand,
    Which envious Eld forbore, and tyrants left to stand.[ea]

                              XIV.

    Where was thine AEgis, Pallas! that appalled[eb]
      Stern Alaric and Havoc on their way?[8.B.]
      Where Peleus' son? whom Hell in vain enthralled.
      His shade from Hades upon that dread day
      Bursting to light in terrible array!
      What! could not Pluto spare the Chief once more,
      To scare a second robber from his prey?
      Idly he wandered on the Stygian shore,
    Nor now preserved the walls he loved to shield before.

                              XV.

    Cold is the heart, fair Greece! that looks on Thee,
      Nor feels as Lovers o'er the dust they loved;
      Dull is the eye that will not weep to see
      Thy walls defaced, thy mouldering shrines removed
      By British hands, which it had best behoved[ec]
      To guard those relics ne'er to be restored:--
      Curst be the hour when from their isle they roved,
      And once again thy hapless bosom gored,
    And snatched thy shrinking Gods to Northern climes abhorred![123]

                              XVI.

    But where is Harold? shall I then forget
      To urge the gloomy Wanderer o'er the wave?
      Little recked he of all that Men regret;
      No loved-one now in feigned lament could rave;[124]
      No friend the parting hand extended gave,
      Ere the cold Stranger passed to other climes:
      Hard is his heart whom charms may not enslave;
      But Harold felt not as in other times,
    And left without a sigh the land of War and Crimes.

                             XVII.

    He that has sailed upon the dark blue sea
      Has viewed at times, I ween, a full fair sight,
      When the fresh breeze is fair as breeze may be,
      The white sail set, the gallant Frigate tight--
      Masts, spires, and strand retiring to the right,
      The glorious Main expanding o'er the bow,
      The Convoy spread like wild swans in their flight,
      The dullest sailer wearing bravely now--
    So gaily curl the waves before each dashing prow.

                             XVIII.

    And oh, the little warlike world within!
      The well-reeved guns, the netted canopy,[9.B.]
      The hoarse command, the busy humming din,
      When, at a word, the tops are manned on high:
      Hark, to the Boatswain's call, the cheering cry!
      While through the seaman's hand the tackle glides;
      Or schoolboy Midshipman that, standing by,
      Strains his shrill pipe as good or ill betides,
    And well the docile crew that skilful Urchin guides.[ed]

                              XIX.

    White is the glassy deck, without a stain,
      Where on the watch the staid Lieutenant walks:
      Look on that part which sacred doth remain[ee]
      For the lone Chieftain, who majestic stalks,
      Silent and feared by all--not oft he talks
      With aught beneath him, if he would preserve
      That strict restraint, which broken, ever balks
      Conquest and Fame: but Britons rarely swerve
    From law, however stern, which tends their strength to nerve[ef].

                              XX.

    Blow! swiftly blow, thou keel-compelling gale!
      Till the broad Sun withdraws his lessening ray:
      Then must the Pennant-bearer slacken sail,
      That lagging barks may make their lazy way.[125]
      Ah! grievance sore, and listless dull delay,
      To waste on sluggish hulks the sweetest breeze!
      What leagues are lost, before the dawn of day,
      Thus loitering pensive on the willing seas,
    The flapping sail hauled down to halt for logs like these!

                              XXI.

    The Moon is up; by Heaven, a lovely eve!
      Long streams of light o'er dancing waves expand;
      Now lads on shore may sigh, and maids believe[eg]:
      Such be our fate when we return to land!
      Meantime some rude Arion's restless hand[eh]
      Wakes the brisk harmony that sailors love;
      A circle there of merry listeners stand
      Or to some well-known measure featly move,
    Thoughtless, as if on shore they still were free to rove.

                             XXII.

    Through Calpe's straits survey the steepy shore;[ei]
      Europe and Afric on each other gaze![126]
      Lands of the dark-eyed Maid and dusky Moor
      Alike beheld beneath pale Hecate's blaze:
      How softly on the Spanish shore she plays![127]
      Disclosing rock, and slope, and forest brown,[128]
      Distinct, though darkening with her waning phase;
      But Mauritania's giant-shadows frown,
    From mountain-cliff to coast descending sombre down.

                             XXIII.

    'Tis night, when Meditation bids us feel
      We once have loved, though Love is at an end:
      The Heart, lone mourner of its baffled zeal,[ej]
      Though friendless now, will dream it had a friend.
      Who with the weight of years would wish to bend,
      When Youth itself survives young Love and Joy?
      Alas! when mingling souls forget to blend,
      Death hath but little left him to destroy!
    Ah! happy years! once more who would not be a boy?[ek]

                             XXIV.

    Thus bending o'er the vessel's laving side,
      To gaze on Dian's wave-reflected sphere,[el]
      The Soul forgets her schemes of Hope and Pride,[em]
      And flies unconscious o'er each backward year;
      None are so desolate but something dear,[en]
      Dearer than self, possesses or possessed
      A thought, and claims the homage of a tear;
      A flashing pang! of which the weary breast
    Would still, albeit in vain, the heavy heart divest.

                             XXV.[eo][129]

    To sit on rocks--to muse o'er flood and fell--
      To slowly trace the forest's shady scene,
      Where things that own not Man's dominion dwell,
      And mortal foot hath ne'er or rarely been;
      To climb the trackless mountain all unseen,
      With the wild flock that never needs a fold;
      Alone o'er steeps and foaming falls to lean;[ep]
      This is not Solitude--'tis but to hold
    Converse with Nature's charms, and view her stores unrolled.

                             XXVI.

    But midst the crowd, the hum, the shock of men,
      To hear, to see, to feel, and to possess,
      And roam along, the World's tired denizen,
      With none who bless us, none whom we can bless;
      Minions of Splendour shrinking from distress![130]
      None that, with kindred consciousness endued,
      If we were not, would seem to smile the less,
      Of all that flattered--followed--sought, and sued:
    This is to be alone--This, This is Solitude![eq]

                          XXVII.[131]

    More blest the life of godly Eremite,
      Such as on lonely Athos may be seen,
      Watching at eve upon the Giant Height,
      Which looks o'er waves so blue, skies so serene,
      That he who there at such an hour hath been
      Will wistful linger on that hallowed spot;
      Then slowly tear him from the 'witching scene,
      Sigh forth one wish that such had been his lot,
    Then turn to hate a world he had almost forgot.

                            XXVIII.

    Pass we the long unvarying course, the track
      Oft trod, that never leaves a trace behind;
      Pass we the calm--the gale--the change--the tack,
      And each well known caprice of wave and wind;
      Pass we the joys and sorrows sailors find,
      Cooped in their winged sea-girt citadel;
      The foul--the fair--the contrary--the kind--
      As breezes rise and fall and billows swell,
    Till on some jocund morn--lo, Land! and All is well!

                             XXIX.

    But not in silence pass Calypso's isles,[10.B.]
      The sister tenants of the middle deep;
      There for the weary still a Haven smiles,
      Though the fair Goddess long hath ceased to weep,
      And o'er her cliffs a fruitless watch to keep
      For him who dared prefer a mortal bride:
      Here, too, his boy essayed the dreadful leap
      Stern Mentor urged from high to yonder tide;
    While thus of both bereft, the Nymph-Queen doubly sighed.[132]

                              XXX.

    Her reign is past, her gentle glories gone:
      But trust not this; too easy Youth, beware!
      A mortal Sovereign holds her dangerous throne,
      And thou may'st find a new Calypso there.
      Sweet Florence[133] could another ever share
      This wayward, loveless heart, it would be thine:
      But checked by every tie, I may not dare
      To cast a worthless offering at thy shrine,
    Nor ask so dear a breast to feel one pang for _mine_.

                             XXXI.

    Thus Harold deemed, as on that Lady's eye
      He looked, and met its beam without a thought,
      Save Admiration glancing harmless by:
      Love kept aloof, albeit not far remote,
      Who knew his Votary often lost and caught,
      But knew him as his Worshipper no more,
      And ne'er again the Boy his bosom sought:
      Since now he vainly urged him to adore,
    Well deemed the little God his ancient sway was o'er.

                             XXXII.

    Fair Florence found, in sooth with some amaze,
      One who, 'twas said, still sighed to all he saw,
      Withstand, unmoved, the lustre of her gaze,
      Which others hailed with real or mimic awe,
      Their hope, their doom, their punishment, their law;
      All that gay Beauty from her bondsmen claims:
      And much she marvelled that a youth so raw
      Nor felt, nor feigned at least, the oft-told flames,
    Which though sometimes they frown, yet rarely anger dames.

                            XXXIII.

    Little knew she that seeming marble heart,
      Now masked in silence or withheld by Pride,
      Was not unskilful in the spoiler's art,
      And spread its snares licentious far and wide;[134]
      Nor from the base pursuit had turned aside,
      As long as aught was worthy to pursue:
      But Harold on such arts no more relied;
      And had he doted on those eyes so blue,
    Yet never would he join the lover's whining crew.

                             XXXIV.

    Not much he kens, I ween, of Woman's breast,
      Who thinks that wanton thing is won by sighs;
      What careth she for hearts when once possessed?
      Do proper homage to thine Idol's eyes;
      But not too humbly, or she will despise
      Thee and thy suit, though told in moving tropes:
      Disguise ev'n tenderness, if thou art wise;
      Brisk Confidence still best with woman copes:[er]
    Pique her and soothe in turn--soon Passion crowns thy hopes.

                             XXXV.

    'Tis an old lesson--Time approves it true,
      And those who know it best, deplore it most;
      When all is won that all desire to woo,
      The paltry prize is hardly worth the cost:
      Youth wasted--Minds degraded--Honour lost--[es]
      These are thy fruits, successful Passion! these![135]
      If, kindly cruel, early Hope is crost,
      Still to the last it rankles, a disease,
    Not to be cured when Love itself forgets to please.

                             XXXVI.

    Away! nor let me loiter in my song,
      For we have many a mountain-path to tread,
      And many a varied shore to sail along,
      By pensive Sadness, not by Fiction, led--
      Climes, fair withal as ever mortal head[et]
      Imagined in its little schemes of thought;[eu]
      Or e'er in new Utopias were ared,[136]
      To teach Man what he might be, or he ought--
    If that corrupted thing could ever such be taught.

                            XXXVII.

    Dear Nature is the kindest mother still!
      Though always changing, in her aspect mild;
      From her bare bosom let me take my fill,
      Her never-weaned, though not her favoured child.[ev]
      Oh! she is fairest in her features wild,
      Where nothing polished dares pollute her path:
      To me by day or night she ever smiled,
      Though I have marked her when none other hath,
    And sought her more and more, and loved her best in wrath.[137]

                            XXXVIII.

    Land of Albania! where Iskander rose,[138]
      Theme of the young, and beacon of the wise,[139]
      And he his namesake, whose oft-baffled foes
      Shrunk from his deeds of chivalrous emprize:
      Land of Albania! let me bend mine eyes[11.B.]
      On thee, thou rugged Nurse of savage men!
      The Cross descends, thy Minarets arise,
      And the pale Crescent sparkles in the glen,
    Through many a cypress-grove within each city's ken.

                             XXXIX.

    Childe Harold sailed, and passed the barren spot,[140]
      Where sad Penelope o'erlooked the wave;[12.B.]
      And onward viewed the mount, not yet forgot,
      The Lover's refuge, and the Lesbian's grave.
      Dark Sappho! could not Verse immortal save
      That breast imbued with such immortal fire?
      Could she not live who life eternal gave?
      If life eternal may await the lyre,
    That only Heaven to which Earth's children may aspire.[141]

                              XL.

    'Twas on a Grecian autumn's gentle eve
      Childe Harold hailed Leucadia's cape afar;
      A spot he longed to see, nor cared to leave:
      Oft did he mark the scenes of vanished war,
      Actium--Lepanto--fatal Trafalgar;[13.B.]
      Mark them unmoved, for he would not delight
      (Born beneath some remote inglorious star)[142]
      In themes of bloody fray, or gallant fight,
    But loathed the bravo's trade, and laughed at martial wight.[ew]

                              XLI.

    But when he saw the Evening star above
      Leucadia's far-projecting rock of woe,
      And hailed the last resort of fruitless love,[14.B.]
      He felt, or deemed he felt, no common glow:
      And as the stately vessel glided slow[143]
      Beneath the shadow of that ancient mount,
      He watched the billows' melancholy flow,
      And, sunk albeit in thought as he was wont,[ex]
    More placid seemed his eye, and smooth his pallid front.

                             XLII.

    Morn dawns; and with it stern Albania's hills,
      Dark Suli's rocks, and Pindus' inland peak,[144]
      Robed half in mist, bedewed with snowy rills,
      Arrayed in many a dun and purple streak,
      Arise; and, as the clouds along them break,
      Disclose the dwelling of the mountaineer:
      Here roams the wolf--the eagle whets his beak--
      Birds--beasts of prey--and wilder men appear,
    And gathering storms around convulse the closing year.

                             XLIII.

    Now Harold felt himself at length alone,
      And bade to Christian tongues a long adieu;
      Now he adventured on a shore unknown,[145]
      Which all admire, but many dread to view:
      His breast was armed 'gainst fate, his wants were few
      Peril he sought not, but ne'er shrank to meet:
      The scene was savage, but the scene was new;
      _This_ made the ceaseless toil of travel sweet,
    Beat back keen Winter's blast, and welcomed Summer's heat.

                             XLIV.

    Here the red Cross, for still the Cross is here,
      Though sadly scoffed at by the circumcised,
      Forgets that Pride to pampered priesthood dear;
      Churchman and Votary alike despised.
      Foul Superstition! howsoe'er disguised,
      Idol--Saint--Virgin--Prophet--Crescent--Cross--
      For whatsoever symbol thou art prized,
      Thou sacerdotal gain, but general loss!
    Who from true Worship's gold can separate thy dross?

                              XLV.

    Ambracia's gulf behold, where once was lost
      A world for Woman, lovely, harmless thing![ey][146]
      In yonder rippling bay, their naval host
      Did many a Roman chief and Asian King[15.B.]
      To doubtful conflict, certain slaughter bring:
      Look where the second Caesar's trophies rose![147][16.B.]
      Now, like the hands that reared them, withering:
      Imperial Anarchs, doubling human woes![ez]
    GOD! was thy globe ordained for such to win and lose?

                             XLVI.

    From the dark barriers of that rugged clime,
      Ev'n to the centre of Illyria's vales,
      Childe Harold passed o'er many a mount sublime,
      Through lands scarce noticed in historic tales:
      Yet in famed Attica such lovely dales
      Are rarely seen; nor can fair Tempe boast
      A charm they know not; loved Parnassus fails,
      Though classic ground and consecrated most,
    To match some spots that lurk within this lowering coast.

                             XLVII.

    He passed bleak Pindus, Acherusia's lake,[17.B.]
      And left the primal city of the land,
      And onwards did his further journey take[148]
      To greet Albania's Chief, whose dread command[18.B.]
      Is lawless law; for with a bloody hand
      He sways a nation,--turbulent and bold:
      Yet here and there some daring mountain-band
      Disdain his power, and from their rocky hold
    Hurl their defiance far, nor yield, unless to gold.[19.B.]

                            XLVIII.

    Monastic Zitza![149] from thy shady brow,[20.B.]
      Thou small, but favoured spot of holy ground!
      Where'er we gaze--around--above--below,--
      What rainbow tints, what magic charms are found!
      Rock, river, forest, mountain, all abound,
      And bluest skies that harmonise the whole:
      Beneath, the distant Torrent's rushing sound
      Tells where the volumed Cataract doth roll
    Between those hanging rocks, that shock yet please the soul.

                             XLIX.

    Amidst the grove that crowns yon tufted hill,
      Which, were it not for many a mountain nigh
      Rising in lofty ranks, and loftier still,
      Might well itself be deemed of dignity,
      The Convent's white walls glisten fair on high:
      Here dwells the caloyer, nor rude is he,[21.B.]
      Nor niggard of his cheer;[150] the passer by
      Is welcome still; nor heedless will he flee
    From hence, if he delight kind Nature's sheen to see.

                               L.

    Here in the sultriest season let him rest,
      Fresh is the green beneath those aged trees;
      Here winds of gentlest wing will fan his breast,[fa]
      From Heaven itself he may inhale the breeze:
      The plain is far beneath--oh! let him seize
      Pure pleasure while he can; the scorching ray
      Here pierceth not, impregnate with disease:
      Then let his length the loitering pilgrim lay,
    And gaze, untired, the Morn--the Noon--the Eve away.

                              LI.

    Dusky and huge, enlarging on the sight,
      Nature's volcanic Amphitheatre,[22.B.]
      Chimaera's Alps extend from left to right:
      Beneath, a living valley seems to stir;
      Flocks play, trees wave, streams flow, the mountain-fir
      Nodding above; behold black Acheron![23.B.]
      Once consecrated to the sepulchre.
      Pluto! if this be Hell I look upon,
    Close shamed Elysium's gates, my shade shall seek for none[fb].

                              LII.

    Ne city's towers pollute the lovely view;
      Unseen is Yanina, though not remote,
      Veiled by the screen of hills: here men are few,
      Scanty the hamlet, rare the lonely cot:
      But, peering down each precipice, the goat[fc]
      Browseth; and, pensive o'er his scattered flock,
      The little shepherd in his white capote[24.B.]
      Doth lean his boyish form along the rock,
    Or in his cave awaits the Tempest's short-lived shock.[fd]

                             LIII.

    Oh! where, Dodona![151] is thine aged Grove,
      Prophetic Fount, and Oracle divine?
      What valley echoed the response of Jove?
      What trace remaineth of the Thunderer's shrine?
      All, all forgotten--and shall Man repine
      That his frail bonds to fleeting life are broke?[152]
      Cease, Fool! the fate of Gods may well be thine:
      Wouldst thou survive the marble or the oak?
    When nations, tongues, and worlds must sink beneath the stroke!

                              LIV.

    Epirus' bounds recede, and mountains fail;[153]
      Tired of up-gazing still, the wearied eye
      Reposes gladly on as smooth a vale
      As ever Spring yclad in grassy dye:[154]
      Ev'n on a plain no humble beauties lie,
      Where some bold river breaks the long expanse,
      And woods along the banks are waving high,
      Whose shadows in the glassy waters dance,
    Or with the moonbeam sleep in Midnight's solemn trance.

                              LV.

    The Sun had sunk behind vast Tomerit,[25.B.]
      And Laos wide and fierce came roaring by;[26.B.]
      The shades of wonted night were gathering yet,
      When, down the steep banks winding warily,
      Childe Harold saw, like meteors in the sky,[155]
      The glittering minarets of Tepalen,
      Whose walls o'erlook the stream; and drawing nigh,
      He heard the busy hum of warrior-men
    Swelling the breeze that sighed along the lengthening glen.

                              LVI.

    He passed the sacred Haram's silent tower,
      And underneath the wide o'erarching gate
      Surveyed the dwelling of this Chief of power,
      Where all around proclaimed his high estate.
      Amidst no common pomp the Despot sate,
      While busy preparation shook the court,
      Slaves, eunuchs, soldiers, guests, and santons[156] wait;[fe]
      Within, a palace, and without, a fort:
    Here men of every clime appear to make resort.

                             LVII.

    Richly caparisoned, a ready row
      Of armed horse, and many a warlike store,
      Circled the wide-extending court below;
      Above, strange groups adorned the corridore;
      And oft-times through the area's echoing door
      Some high-capped Tartar spurred his steed away:
      The Turk--the Greek--the Albanian--and the Moor,
      Here mingled in their many-hued array,
    While the deep war-drum's sound announced the close of day.[ff]

                             LVIII.

    The wild Albanian kirtled to his knee,
      With shawl-girt head and ornamented gun,
      And gold-embroidered garments, fair to see;
      The crimson-scarfed men of Macedon;
      The Delhi with his cap of terror on,
      And crooked glaive--the lively, supple Greek
      And swarthy Nubia's mutilated son;
      The bearded Turk that rarely deigns to speak,
    Master of all around, too potent to be meek,

                              LIX.

    Are mixed conspicuous: some recline in groups,[157]
      Scanning the motley scene that varies round;
      There some grave Moslem to devotion stoops,
      And some that smoke, and some that play, are found;
      Here the Albanian proudly treads the ground;
      Half-whispering there the Greek is heard to prate;
      Hark! from the Mosque the nightly solemn sound,
      The Muezzin's call doth shake the minaret,
    "There is no god but God!--to prayer--lo! God is great!"

                              LX.

    Just at this season Ramazani's fast[158]
      Through the long day its penance did maintain:
      But when the lingering twilight hour was past,
      Revel and feast assumed the rule again:
      Now all was bustle, and the menial train
      Prepared and spread the plenteous board within;
      The vacant Gallery now seemed made in vain,
      But from the chambers came the mingling din,
    As page and slave anon were passing out and in.[159]

                              LXI.

    Here woman's voice is never heard: apart,
      And scarce permitted, guarded, veiled, to move,[fg]
      She yields to one her person and her heart,
      Tamed to her cage, nor feels a wish to rove:
      For, not unhappy in her Master's love,[fh]
      And joyful in a mother's gentlest cares,
      Blest cares! all other feelings far above!
      Herself more sweetly rears the babe she bears
    Who never quits the breast--no meaner passion shares.

                             LXII.

    In marble-paved pavilion, where a spring
      Of living water from the centre rose,
      Whose bubbling did a genial freshness fling,
      And soft voluptuous couches breathed repose,
      ALI reclined, a man of war and woes:[160]
      Yet in his lineaments ye cannot trace,
      While Gentleness her milder radiance throws[161]
      Along that aged venerable face,
    The deeds that lurk beneath, and stain him with disgrace.

                             LXIII.

    It is not that yon hoary lengthening beard
      Ill suits the passions which belong to Youth;[fi]
      Love conquers Age--so Hafiz hath averr'd,
      So sings the Teian, and he sings in sooth[162]--
      But crimes that scorn the tender voice of ruth,[fj][163]
      Beseeming all men ill, but most the man
      In years, have marked him with a tiger's tooth;
      Blood follows blood, and, through their mortal span,
    In bloodier acts conclude those who with blood began.[fk][164]

                             LXIV.

    'Mid many things most new to ear and eye[fl]
      The Pilgrim rested here his weary feet,
      And gazed around on Moslem luxury,
      Till quickly, wearied with that spacious seat
      Of Wealth and Wantonness, the choice retreat
      Of sated Grandeur from the city's noise:
      And were it humbler it in sooth were sweet;
      But Peace abhorreth artificial joys,
    And Pleasure, leagued with Pomp, the zest of both destroys.

                              LXV.

    Fierce are Albania's children, yet they lack
      Not virtues, were those virtues more mature.
      Where is the foe that ever saw their back?
      Who can so well the toil of War endure?
      Their native fastnesses not more secure
      Than they in doubtful time of troublous need:
      Their wrath how deadly! but their friendship sure,
      When Gratitude or Valour bids them bleed,
    Unshaken rushing on where'er their Chief may lead.

                             LXVI.

    Childe Harold saw them in their Chieftain's tower
      Thronging to War in splendour and success;
      And after viewed them, when, within their power,
      Himself awhile the victim of distress;
      That saddening hour when bad men hotlier press:
      But these did shelter him beneath their roof,
      When less barbarians would have cheered him less,
      And fellow-countrymen have stood aloof--[27.B.]
    In aught that tries the heart, how few withstand the proof!

                             LXVII.

    It chanced that adverse winds once drove his bark
      Full on the coast of Suli's shaggy shore,[165]
      When all around was desolate and dark;
      To land was perilous, to sojourn more;
      Yet for awhile the mariners forbore,
      Dubious to trust where Treachery might lurk:
      At length they ventured forth, though doubting sore
      That those who loathe alike the Frank and Turk
    Might once again renew their ancient butcher-work.

                            LXVIII.

    Vain fear! the Suliotes stretched the welcome hand,
      Led them o'er rocks and past the dangerous swamp,
      Kinder than polished slaves though not so bland,
      And piled the hearth, and wrung their garments damp,
      And filled the bowl, and trimmed the cheerful lamp,
      And spread their fare; though homely, all they had:
      Such conduct bears Philanthropy's rare stamp:
      To rest the weary and to soothe the sad,
    Doth lesson happier men, and shames at least the bad.

                             LXIX.

    It came to pass, that when he did address
      Himself to quit at length this mountain-land,
      Combined marauders half-way barred egress,
      And wasted far and near with glaive and brand;
      And therefore did he take a trusty band
      To traverse Acarnania's forest wide,
      In war well-seasoned, and with labours tanned,
      Till he did greet white Achelous' tide,
    And from his further bank AEtolia's wolds espied.[166]

                              LXX.

    Where lone Utraikey forms its circling cove,[167]
      And weary waves retire to gleam at rest,
      How brown the foliage of the green hill's grove,
      Nodding at midnight o'er the calm bay's breast,
      As winds come lightly whispering from the West,
      Kissing, not ruffling, the blue deep's serene:--
      Here Harold was received a welcome guest;
      Nor did he pass unmoved the gentle scene,
    For many a joy could he from Night's soft presence glean.

                             LXXI.

    On the smooth shore the night-fires brightly blazed,
      The feast was done, the red wine circling fast,[28.B.]
      And he that unawares had there ygazed
      With gaping wonderment had stared aghast;
      For ere night's midmost, stillest hour was past,
      The native revels of the troop began;
      Each Palikar his sabre from him cast,[29.B.]
      And bounding hand in hand, man linked to man,
    Yelling their uncouth dirge, long daunced the kirtled clan.[168]

                             LXXII.

    Childe Harold at a little distance stood
      And viewed, but not displeased, the revelrie,
      Nor hated harmless mirth, however rude:
      In sooth, it was no vulgar sight to see
      Their barbarous, yet their not indecent, glee;
      And, as the flames along their faces gleamed,
      Their gestures nimble, dark eyes flashing free,
      The long wild locks that to their girdles streamed,
    While thus in concert they this lay half sang,
                                               half screamed:--[169][30.B.]


                               1.

    Tambourgi![170] Tambourgi! thy 'larum afar[fm][31.B.]
    Gives hope to the valiant, and promise of war;
    All the Sons of the mountains arise at the note,
    Chimariot, Illyrian, and dark Suliote!

                               2.

    Oh! who is more brave than a dark Suliote,
    In his snowy camese[171] and his shaggy capote?
    To the wolf and the vulture he leaves his wild flock,
    And descends to the plain like the stream from the rock.

                               3.

    Shall the sons of Chimari, who never forgive[fn]
    The fault of a friend, bid an enemy live?
    Let those guns so unerring such vengeance forego?
    What mark is so fair as the breast of a foe?[172]

                               4.

    Macedonia sends forth her invincible race;
    For a time they abandon the cave and the chase:
    But those scarfs of blood-red shall be redder, before
    The sabre is sheathed and the battle is o'er.

                               5.

    Then the Pirates of Parga that dwell by the waves,
    And teach the pale Franks what it is to be slaves,
    Shall leave on the beach the long galley and oar,
    And track to his covert the captive on shore.

                               6.

    I ask not the pleasures that riches supply,
    My sabre shall win what the feeble must buy;
    Shall win the young bride with her long flowing hair,[fo]
    And many a maid from her mother shall tear.

                               7.

    I love the fair face of the maid in her youth,[fp]
    Her caresses shall lull me, her music shall soothe;[fq]
    Let her bring from the chamber her many-toned lyre,
    And sing us a song on the fall of her Sire.

                               8.

    Remember the moment when Previsa fell,[173][32.B.]
    The shrieks of the conquered, the conquerors' yell;
    The roofs that we fired, and the plunder we shared,
    The wealthy we slaughtered, the lovely we spared.

                               9.

    I talk not of mercy, I talk not of fear;
    He neither must know who would serve the Vizier:
    Since the days of our Prophet the Crescent ne'er saw
    A chief ever glorious like Ali Pashaw.

                              10.

    Dark Muchtar his son to the Danube is sped,[174]
    Let the yellow-haired[175] Giaours[176]
                                      view his horse-tail[177] with dread;
    When his Delhis[178] come dashing in blood o'er the banks,
    How few shall escape from the Muscovite ranks!

                              11.

    Selictar![179] unsheathe then our chief's Scimit?r;
    Tambourgi! thy 'larum gives promise of War.[fr]
    Ye Mountains, that see us descend to the shore,
    Shall view us as Victors, or view us no more!

                            LXXIII.

    Fair Greece! sad relic of departed Worth![33.B.]
      Immortal, though no more; though fallen, great!
      Who now shall lead thy scattered children forth,
      And long accustomed bondage uncreate?
      Not such thy sons who whilome did await,
      The helpless warriors of a willing doom,
      In bleak Thermopylae's sepulchral strait--
      Oh! who that gallant spirit shall resume,
    Leap from Eurotas' banks, and call thee from the tomb?[180]

                             LXXIV.

    Spirit of Freedom! when on Phyle's brow[34.B.]
      Thou sat'st with Thrasybulus and his train,
      Couldst thou forebode the dismal hour which now
      Dims the green beauties of thine Attic plain?
      Not thirty tyrants now enforce the chain,
      But every carle can lord it o'er thy land;
      Nor rise thy sons, but idly rail in vain,
      Trembling beneath the scourge of Turkish hand,
    From birth till death enslaved; in word, in deed, unmanned.[fs]

                             LXXV.

    In all save form alone, how changed! and who
      That marks the fire still sparkling in each eye,
      Who but would deem their bosoms burned anew
      With thy unquenched beam, lost Liberty![ft]
      And many dream withal the hour is nigh
      That gives them back their fathers' heritage:
      For foreign arms and aid they fondly sigh,
      Nor solely dare encounter hostile rage,
    Or tear their name defiled from Slavery's mournful page.

                             LXXVI.

    Hereditary Bondsmen! know ye not
      _Who_ would be free _themselves_ must strike the blow?
      By their right arms the conquest must be wrought?[181]
      Will Gaul or Muscovite redress ye? No!
      True--they may lay your proud despoilers low,
      But not for you will Freedom's Altars flame.
      Shades of the Helots! triumph o'er your foe!
      Greece! change thy lords, thy state is still the same;
    Thy glorious day is o'er, but not thine years of shame.

                            LXXVII.

    The city won for Allah from the Giaour
      The Giaour from Othman's race again may wrest;
      And the Serai's impenetrable tower

      Or Wahab's[182] rebel brood who dared divest
      The Prophet's tomb of all its pious spoil,[36.B.]
      May wind their path of blood along the West;
      But ne'er will Freedom seek this fated soil,
    But slave succeed to slave through years of endless toil.

    Yet mark their mirth--ere Lenten days begin,
      That penance which their holy rites prepare
      To shrive from Man his weight of mortal sin,
      By daily abstinence and nightly prayer;
      But ere his sackcloth garb Repentance wear,
      Some days of joyaunce are decreed to all,
      To take of pleasaunce each his secret share,
      In motley robe to dance at masking ball,
    And join the mimic train of merry Carnival.

    And whose more rife with merriment than thine,
      Oh Stamboul! once the Empress of their reign?
      Though turbans now pollute Sophia's shrine,
      And Greece her very altars eyes in vain:
      (Alas! her woes will still pervade my strain!)
      Gay were her minstrels once, for free her throng,
      All felt the common joy they now must feign,
      Nor oft I've seen such sight, nor heard such song,
    As wooed the eye, and thrilled the Bosphorus along.

                             LXXX.

    Loud was the lightsome tumult on the shore,[184]
      Oft Music changed, but never ceased her tone,
      And timely echoed back the measured oar,
      And rippling waters made a pleasant moan:
      The Queen of tides on high consenting shone,
      And when a transient breeze swept o'er the wave,
      'Twas, as if darting from her heavenly throne,
      A brighter glance her form reflected gave,
    Till sparkling billows seemed to light the banks they lave.

                             LXXXI.

    Glanced many a light Caique along the foam,
      Danced on the shore the daughters of the land,
      No thought had man or maid of rest or home,
      While many a languid eye and thrilling hand
      Exchanged the look few bosoms may withstand,
      Or gently prest, returned the pressure still:
      Oh Love! young Love! bound in thy rosy band,
      Let sage or cynic prattle as he will,
    These hours, and only these, redeem Life's years of ill![185]

                            LXXXII.

    But, midst the throng in merry masquerade,
      Lurk there no hearts that throb with secret pain,
      Even through the closest searment[186] half betrayed?
      To such the gentle murmurs of the main
      Seem to re-echo all they mourn in vain;
      To such the gladness of the gamesome crowd
      Is source of wayward thought and stern disdain:
      How do they loathe the laughter idly loud,
    And long to change the robe of revel for the shroud!

                            LXXXIII.

    This must he feel, the true-born son of Greece,
      If Greece one true-born patriot still can boast:
      Not such as prate of War, but skulk in Peace,
      The bondsman's peace, who sighs for all he lost,
      Yet with smooth smile his Tyrant can accost,
      And wield the slavish sickle, not the sword:
      Ah! Greece! they love thee least who owe thee most--
      Their birth, their blood, and that sublime record[187]
    Of hero Sires, who shame thy now degenerate horde!

                            LXXXIV.

    When riseth Lacedemon's Hardihood,
      When Thebes Epaminondas rears again,
      When Athens' children are with hearts endued,[fu]
      When Grecian mothers shall give birth to men,
      Then may'st thou be restored; but not till then.
      A thousand years scarce serve to form a state;
      An hour may lay it in the dust: and when
      Can Man its shattered splendour renovate,
    Recall its virtues back, and vanquish Time and Fate?

                             LXXXV.

    And yet how lovely in thine age of woe,
      Land of lost Gods and godlike men, art thou!
      Thy vales of evergreen, thy hills of snow,[37.B.]
      Proclaim thee Nature's varied favourite now:
      Thy fanes, thy temples to thy surface bow,
      Commingling slowly with heroic earth,
      Broke by the share of every rustic plough:
      So perish monuments of mortal birth,
    So perish all in turn, save well-recorded _Worth_:[188]

                            LXXXVI.

    Save where some solitary column[189] mourns
      Above its prostrate brethren of the cave;[38.B.]
      Save where Tritonia's[190] airy shrine adorns
      Colonna's cliff,[191] and gleams along the wave;
      Save o'er some warrior's half-forgotten grave,
      Where the gray stones and unmolested grass
      Ages, but not Oblivion, feebly brave;
      While strangers, only, not regardless pass,
    Lingering like me, perchance, to gaze, and sigh "Alas!"

                            LXXXVII.

    Yet are thy skies as blue, thy crags as wild;
      Sweet are thy groves, and verdant are thy fields,
      Thine olive ripe as when Minerva[192] smiled,
      And still his honied wealth Hymettus[193] yields;
      There the blithe Bee his fragrant fortress builds,
      The free-born wanderer of thy mountain-air;
      Apollo still thy long, long summer gilds,
      Still in his beam Mendeli's marbles glare:[fv]
    Art, Glory, Freedom fail, but Nature still is fair.

                         LXXXVIII.[194]

    Where'er we tread 'tis haunted, holy ground;
      No earth of thine is lost in vulgar mould,
      But one vast realm of Wonder spreads around,
      And all the Muse's tales seem truly told,
      Till the sense aches with gazing to behold
      The scenes our earliest dreams have dwelt upon;
      Each hill and dale, each deepening glen and wold
      Defies the power which crushed thy temples gone:
    Age shakes Athenae's tower, but spares gray Marathon.[195]

                            LXXXIX.

    The Sun, the soil--but not the slave, the same;--
      Unchanged in all except its foreign Lord,
      Preserves alike its bounds and boundless fame[fw]
      The Battle-field, where Persia's victim horde
      First bowed beneath the brunt of Hellas' sword,
      As on the morn to distant Glory dear,
      When Marathon became a magic word;[39.B.]
      Which uttered, to the hearer's eye appear[fx]
    The camp, the host, the fight, the Conqueror's career,[fy]

                              XC.

    The flying Mede, his shaftless broken bow--[fz][196]
      The fiery Greek, his red pursuing spear;
      Mountains above--Earth's, Ocean's plain below--
      Death in the front, Destruction in the rear!
      Such was the scene--what now remaineth here?
      What sacred Trophy marks the hallowed ground,
      Recording Freedom's smile and Asia's tear?[ga]
      The rifled urn, the violated mound,[197]
    The dust thy courser's hoof, rude stranger! spurns around.

                              XCI.

    Yet to the remnants of thy Splendour past[gb]
      Shall pilgrims, pensive, but unwearied, throng;
      Long shall the voyager, with th' Ionian blast,[198]
      Hail the bright clime of Battle and of Song:
      Long shall thine annals and immortal tongue
      Fill with thy fame the youth of many a shore;
      Boast of the aged! lesson of the young!
      Which Sages venerate and Bards adore,
    As Pallas and the Muse unveil their awful lore.

                             XCII.

    The parted bosom clings to wonted home,
      If aught that's kindred cheer the welcome hearth;
      He that is lonely--hither let him roam,
      And gaze complacent on congenial earth.
      Greece is no lightsome land of social mirth:
      But he whom Sadness sootheth may abide,
      And scarce regret the region of his birth,
      When wandering slow by Delphi's sacred side,
    Or gazing o'er the plains where Greek and Persian died.[199]

                             XCIII.

    Let such approach this consecrated Land,
      And pass in peace along the magic waste;
      But spare its relics--let no busy hand
      Deface the scenes, already how defaced!
      Not for such purpose were these altars placed:
      Revere the remnants Nations once revered:
      So may our Country's name be undisgraced,
      So may'st thou prosper where thy youth was reared,
    By every honest joy of Love and Life endeared!

                             XCIV.

    For thee, who thus in too protracted song
      Hast soothed thine Idlesse with inglorious lays,
      Soon shall thy voice be lost amid the throng
      Of louder Minstrels in these later days:
      To such resign the strife for fading Bays--
      Ill may such contest now the spirit move
      Which heeds nor keen Reproach nor partial Praise,[gc]
      Since cold each kinder heart that might approve--
    And none are left to please when none are left to love.

                              XCV.

    Thou too art gone, thou loved and lovely one!
      Whom Youth and Youth's affections bound to me;
      Who did for me what none beside have done,
      Nor shrank from one albeit unworthy thee.
      What is my Being! thou hast ceased to be!
      Nor staid to welcome here thy wanderer home,
      Who mourns o'er hours which we no more shall see--
      Would they had never been, or were to come!
    Would he had ne'er returned to find fresh cause to roam![gd][200]

                             XCVI.

    Oh! ever loving, lovely, and beloved!
      How selfish Sorrow ponders on the past,
      And clings to thoughts now better far removed!
      But Time shall tear thy shadow from me last.[ge]
      All thou couldst have of mine, stern Death! thou hast;
      The Parent, Friend, and now the more than Friend:
      Ne'er yet for one thine arrows flew so fast,[201]
      And grief with grief continuing still to blend,
    Hath snatched the little joy that Life had yet to lend.

                             XCVII.

    Then must I plunge again into the crowd,
      And follow all that Peace disdains to seek?
      Where Revel calls, and Laughter, vainly loud,
      False to the heart, distorts the hollow cheek,
      To leave the flagging spirit doubly weak;
      Still o'er the features, which perforce they cheer,
      To feign the pleasure or conceal the pique:
      Smiles form the channel of a future tear,
    Or raise the writhing lip with ill-dissembled sneer.

                            XCVIII.

    What is the worst of woes that wait on Age?
      What stamps the wrinkle deeper on the brow?
      To view each loved one blotted from Life's page,
      And be alone on earth, as I am now.
      Before the Chastener humbly let me bow,
      O'er Hearts divided and o'er Hopes destroyed:
      Roll on, vain days! full reckless may ye flow,
      Since Time hath reft whate'er my soul enjoyed,[gf]
    And with the ills of Eld mine earlier years alloyed.

                             CANTO THE THIRD.

                               I.

    Is thy face like thy mothers, my fair child!
      ADA! sole daughter of my house and heart?[276]
      When last I saw thy young blue eyes they smiled,
      And then we parted,--not as now we part,
      But with a hope.--
                         Awaking with a start,
      The waters heave around me; and on high
      The winds lift up their voices: I depart,
      Whither I know not; but the hour's gone by,
    When Albion's lessening shores could grieve or glad mine eye.[gh]

                              II.

    Once more upon the waters! yet once more![277]
      And the waves bound beneath me as a steed
      That knows his rider.[278] Welcome to their roar!
      Swift be their guidance, wheresoe'er it lead!
      Though the strained mast should quiver as a reed,
      And the rent canvass fluttering strew the gale,[gi]
      Still must I on; for I am as a weed,
      Flung from the rock, on Ocean's foam, to sail
    Where'er the surge may sweep, the tempest's breath prevail.

                              III.

    In my youth's summer I did sing of One,
      The wandering outlaw of his own dark mind;[279]
      Again I seize the theme, then but begun,
      And bear it with me, as the rushing wind
      Bears the cloud onwards: in that Tale I find
      The furrows of long thought, and dried-up tears,
      Which, ebbing, leave a sterile track behind,
      O'er which all heavily the journeying years
    Plod the last sands of life,--where not a flower appears.

                              IV.

    Since my young days of passion--joy, or pain--
      Perchance my heart and harp have lost a string--
      And both may jar: it may be, that in vain
      I would essay as I have sung to sing[gj]:
      Yet, though a dreary strain, to this I cling;
      So that it wean me from the weary dream
      Of selfish grief or gladness--so it fling
      Forgetfulness around me--it shall seem
    To me, though to none else, a not ungrateful theme.

                               V.

    He, who grown aged in this world of woe,
      In deeds, not years,[280] piercing the depths of life,
      So that no wonder waits him--nor below
      Can Love or Sorrow, Fame, Ambition, Strife,
      Cut to his heart again with the keen knife
      Of silent, sharp endurance--he can tell
      Why Thought seeks refuge in lone caves, yet rife
      With airy images, and shapes which dwell
    Still unimpaired, though old, in the Soul's haunted cell.[gk]

                              VI.

    'Tis to create, and in creating live[281]
      A being more intense that we endow[gl]
      With form our fancy, gaining as we give
      The life we image, even as I do now--
      What am I? Nothing: but not so art thou,
      Soul of my thought! with whom I traverse earth,
      Invisible but gazing, as I glow--
      Mixed with thy spirit, blended with thy birth,
    And feeling still with thee in my crushed feelings' dearth.

                              VII.

    Yet must I think less wildly:--I _have_ thought
      Too long and darkly, till my brain became,
      In its own eddy boiling and o'erwrought,
      A whirling gulf of phantasy and flame:[gm]
      And thus, untaught in youth my heart to tame,
      My springs of life were poisoned.[282] 'Tis too late:
      Yet am I changed; though still enough the same
      In strength to bear what Time can not abate,[gn]
    And feed on bitter fruits without accusing Fate.

                             VIII.

    Something too much of this:--but now 'tis past,
      And the spell closes with its silent seal--[283]
      Long absent HAROLD re-appears at last;
      He of the breast which fain no more would feel,[go]
      Wrung with the wounds which kill not, but ne'er heal;
      Yet Time, who changes all, had altered him
      In soul and aspect as in age: years steal
      Fire from the mind as vigour from the limb;
    And Life's enchanted cup but sparkles near the brim.

                              IX.

    His had been quaffed too quickly, and he found
      The dregs were wormwood; but he filled again,
      And from a purer fount, on holier ground,
      And deemed its spring perpetual--but in vain!
      Still round him clung invisibly a chain
      Which galled for ever, fettering though unseen,
      And heavy though it clanked not; worn with pain,
      Which pined although it spoke not, and grew keen,
    Entering with every step he took through many a scene.

                               X.

    Secure in guarded coldness, he had mixed[gp]
      Again in fancied safety with his kind,
      And deemed his spirit now so firmly fixed
      And sheathed with an invulnerable mind,
      That, if no joy, no sorrow lurked behind;
      And he, as one, might 'midst the many stand
      Unheeded, searching through the crowd to find
      Fit speculation--such as in strange land
    He found in wonder-works of God and Nature's hand.[gq]

                              XI.

    But who can view the ripened rose, nor seek[gr]
      To wear it? who can curiously behold
      The smoothness and the sheen of Beauty's cheek,
      Nor feel the heart can never all grow old?[gs]
      Who can contemplate Fame through clouds unfold
      The star[284] which rises o'er her steep, nor climb?
      Harold, once more within the vortex, rolled
      On with the giddy circle, chasing Time,
    Yet with a nobler aim than in his Youth's fond prime.[gt][285]

                              XII.

    But soon he knew himself the most unfit[gu]
      Of men to herd with Man, with whom he held
      Little in common; untaught to submit
      His thoughts to others, though his soul was quelled
      In youth by his own thoughts; still uncompelled,
      He would not yield dominion of his mind
      To Spirits against whom his own rebelled,
      Proud though in desolation--which could find
    A life within itself, to breathe without mankind.

                             XIII.

    Where rose the mountains, there to him were friends;[gv]
      Where rolled the ocean, thereon was his home;
      Where a blue sky, and glowing clime, extends,
      He had the passion and the power to roam;
      The desert, forest, cavern, breaker's foam,
      Were unto him companionship; they spake
      A mutual language, clearer than the tome
      Of his land's tongue, which he would oft forsake
    For Nature's pages glassed by sunbeams on the lake.

                              XIV.

    Like the Chaldean, he could watch the stars,[gw]
      Till he had peopled them with beings bright
      As their own beams; and earth, and earth-born jars,
      And human frailties, were forgotten quite:
      Could he have kept his spirit to that flight
      He had been happy; but this clay will sink
      Its spark immortal, envying it the light
      To which it mounts, as if to break the link
    That keeps us from yon heaven which woos us to its brink.[gx]

                              XV.

    But in Man's dwellings he became a thing[gy]
      Restless and worn, and stern and wearisome,
      Drooped as a wild-born falcon with clipt wing,
      To whom the boundless air alone were home:
      Then came his fit again, which to o'ercome,
      As eagerly the barred-up bird will beat
      His breast and beak against his wiry dome
      Till the blood tinge his plumage--so the heat
    Of his impeded Soul would through his bosom eat.

                              XVI.

    Self-exiled Harold wanders forth again,[286]
      With nought of Hope left--but with less of gloom;
      The very knowledge that he lived in vain,
      That all was over on this side the tomb,
      Had made Despair a smilingness assume,
      Which, though 'twere wild,--as on the plundered wreck
      When mariners would madly meet their doom
      With draughts intemperate on the sinking deck,--
    Did yet inspire a cheer, which he forbore to check.

                             XVII.

    Stop!--for thy tread is on an Empire's dust!
      An Earthquake's spoil is sepulchred below!
      Is the spot marked with no colossal bust?[287]
      Nor column trophied for triumphal show?
      None; but _the moral's truth_ tells simpler so.--[gz][288]
      As the ground was before, thus let it be;--[ha]
      How that red rain hath made the harvest grow!
      And is this all the world has gained by thee,
    Thou first and last of Fields! king-making Victory?

                             XVIII.

    And Harold stands upon this place of skulls,
      The grave of France, the deadly Waterloo![hb]
      How in an hour the Power which gave annuls
      Its gifts, transferring fame as fleeting too!--
      In "pride of place" here last the Eagle flew,[1.B.]
      Then tore with bloody talon the rent plain,[hc]
      Pierced by the shaft of banded nations through;
      Ambition's life and labours all were vain--
    He wears the shattered links of the World's broken chain.[hd]

                              XIX.

    Fit retribution! Gaul may champ the bit
      And foam in fetters;--but is Earth more free?[289]
      Did nations combat to make _One_ submit?
      Or league to teach all Kings true Sovereignty?[he]
      What! shall reviving Thraldom again be
      The patched-up Idol of enlightened days?
      Shall we, who struck the Lion down, shall we
      Pay the Wolf homage? proffering lowly gaze
    And servile knees to Thrones? No! _prove_ before ye praise!

                              XX.

    If not, o'er one fallen Despot boast no more!
      In vain fair cheeks were furrowed with hot tears
      For Europe's flowers long rooted up before
      The trampler of her vineyards; in vain, years
      Of death, depopulation, bondage, fears,
      Have all been borne, and broken by the accord
      Of roused-up millions: all that most endears
      Glory, is when the myrtle wreathes a Sword,
    Such as Harmodius[2.B.] drew on Athens' tyrant Lord.

                              XXI.

    There was a sound of revelry by night,[290]
      And Belgium's Capital had gathered then
      Her Beauty and her Chivalry--and bright
      The lamps shone o'er fair women and brave men;[hf]
      A thousand hearts beat happily; and when
      Music arose with its voluptuous swell,
      Soft eyes looked love to eyes which spake again,
      And all went merry as a marriage bell;[3.B.]
    But hush! hark! a deep sound strikes like a rising knell!

                             XXII.

    Did ye not hear it?--No--'twas but the Wind,
      Or the car rattling o'er the stony street;
      On with the dance! let joy be unconfined;
      No sleep till morn, when Youth and Pleasure meet
      To chase the glowing Hours with flying feet--
      But hark!--that heavy sound breaks in once more,
      As if the clouds its echo would repeat;
      And nearer--clearer--deadlier than before![hg]
    Arm! Arm! it is--it is--the cannon's opening roar![hh]

                             XXIII.

    Within a windowed niche of that high hall
      Sate Brunswick's fated Chieftain; he did hear[291]
      That sound the first amidst the festival,
      And caught its tone with Death's prophetic ear;
      And when they smiled because he deemed it near,
      His heart more truly knew that peal too well[hi]
      Which stretched his father on a bloody bier,
      And roused the vengeance blood alone could quell;
    He rushed into the field, and, foremost fighting, fell.

                             XXIV.

    Ah! then and there was hurrying to and fro--
      And gathering tears, and tremblings of distress,[hj]
      And cheeks all pale, which but an hour ago
      Blushed at the praise of their own loveliness--
      And there were sudden partings, such as press[hk]
      The life from out young hearts, and choking sighs
      Which ne'er might be repeated; who could guess
      If ever more should meet those mutual eyes,
    Since upon night so sweet such awful morn could rise![hl]

                              XXV.

    And there was mounting in hot haste--the steed,
      The mustering squadron, and the clattering car,
      Went pouring forward with impetuous speed,
      And swiftly forming in the ranks of war--
      And the deep thunder peal on peal afar;
      And near, the beat of the alarming drum
      Roused up the soldier ere the Morning Star;
      While thronged the citizens with terror dumb,[hm]
    Or whispering, with white lips--"The foe! They come! they come!"

                             XXVI.

    And wild and high the "Cameron's Gathering" rose!
      The war-note of Lochiel, which Albyn's hills
      Have heard, and heard, too, have her Saxon foes;--
      How in the noon of night that pibroch thrills,
      Savage and shrill! But with the breath which fills
      Their mountain-pipe, so fill the mountaineers
      With the fierce native daring which instils
      The stirring memory of a thousand years,
    And Evan's--Donald's[4.B.] fame rings in each clansman's ears!

                             XXVII.

    And Ardennes[5.B.] waves above them her green leaves,[hn]
      Dewy with Nature's tear-drops, as they pass--
      Grieving, if aught inanimate e'er grieves,
      Over the unreturning brave,--alas!
      Ere evening to be trodden like the grass
      Which now beneath them, but above shall grow
      In its next verdure, when this fiery mass
      Of living Valour, rolling on the foe
    And burning with high Hope, shall moulder cold and low.

                            XXVIII.

    Last noon beheld them full of lusty life;--
      Last eve in Beauty's circle proudly gay;
      The Midnight brought the signal-sound of strife,
      The Morn the marshalling in arms,--the Day
      Battle's magnificently-stern array!
      The thunder-clouds close o'er it, which when rent
      The earth is covered thick with other clay
      Which her own clay shall cover, heaped and pent,
    Rider and horse,--friend,--foe,--in one red burial blent!

                             XXIX.

    Their praise is hymned by loftier harps than mine;
      Yet one I would select from that proud throng,
      Partly because they blend me with his line,
      And partly that I did his Sire some wrong,[292]
      And partly that bright names will hallow song;[ho]
      And his was of the bravest, and when showered
      The death-bolts deadliest the thinned files along,
      Even where the thickest of War's tempest lowered,
    They reached no nobler breast than thine, young, gallant Howard![293]

                              XXX.

    There have been tears and breaking hearts for thee,
      And mine were nothing, had I such to give;
      But when I stood beneath the fresh green tree,
      Which living waves where thou didst cease to live,
      And saw around me the wide field revive
      With fruits and fertile promise, and the Spring[294]
      Come forth her work of gladness to contrive,
      With all her reckless birds upon the wing,
    I turned from all she brought to those she could not bring.[6.B.]

                             XXXI.

    I turned to thee, to thousands, of whom each
      And one as all a ghastly gap did make
      In his own kind and kindred, whom to teach
      Forgetfulness were mercy for their sake;
      The Archangel's trump, not Glory's, must awake
      Those whom they thirst for; though the sound of Fame
      May for a moment soothe, it cannot slake
      The fever of vain longing, and the name
    So honoured but assumes a stronger, bitterer claim.

                             XXXII.

    They mourn, but smile at length--and, smiling, mourn:
      The tree will wither long before it fall;
      The hull drives on, though mast and sail be torn;[hp]
      The roof-tree sinks, but moulders on the hall
      In massy hoariness; the ruined wall
      Stands when its wind-worn battlements are gone;
      The bars survive the captive they enthral;
      The day drags through though storms keep out the sun;[hq]
    And thus the heart will break, yet brokenly live on:[295]

                            XXXIII.

    Even as a broken Mirror,[296] which the glass
      In every fragment multiplies--and makes
      A thousand images of one that was,
      The same--and still the more, the more it breaks;
      And thus the heart will do which not forsakes,
      Living in shattered guise; and still, and cold,
      And bloodless, with its sleepless sorrow aches,
      Yet withers on till all without is old,
    Showing no visible sign, for such things are untold.

                             XXXIV.

    There is a very life in our despair,
      Vitality of poison,--a quick root
      Which feeds these deadly branches; for it were
      As nothing did we die; but Life will suit
      Itself to Sorrow's most detested fruit,
      Like to the apples on the Dead Sea's shore,[7.B.]
      All ashes to the taste: Did man compute
      Existence by enjoyment, and count o'er
    Such hours 'gainst years of life,--say, would he name threescore?

                             XXXV.

    The Psalmist numbered out the years of man:
      They are enough; and if thy tale be _true_,[hr]
      Thou, who didst grudge him even that fleeting span,[297]
      More than enough, thou fatal Waterloo!
      Millions of tongues record thee, and anew
      Their children's lips shall echo them, and say--
      "Here, where the sword united nations drew,[hs]
      Our countrymen were warring on that day!"
    And this is much--and all--which will not pass away.

                             XXXVI.

    There sunk the greatest, nor the worst of men,
      Whose Spirit, antithetically mixed,
      One moment of the mightiest, and again
      On little objects with like firmness fixed;[ht]
      Extreme in all things! hadst thou been betwixt,
      Thy throne had still been thine, or never been;
      For Daring made thy rise as fall: thou seek'st[hu][298]
      Even now to re-assume the imperial mien,[299]
    And shake again the world, the Thunderer of the scene!

                            XXXVII.

    Conqueror and Captive of the Earth art thou!
      She trembles at thee still, and thy wild name[hv]
      Was ne'er more bruited in men's minds than now
      That thou art nothing, save the jest of Fame,
      Who wooed thee once, thy Vassal, and became[hw]
      The flatterer of thy fierceness--till thou wert
      A God unto thyself; nor less the same
      To the astounded kingdoms all inert,
    Who deemed thee for a time whate'er thou didst assert.

                            XXXVIII.

    Oh, more or less than man--in high or low--
      Battling with nations, flying from the field;
      Now making monarchs' necks thy footstool, now
      More than thy meanest soldier taught to yield;
      An Empire thou couldst crush, command, rebuild,
      But govern not thy pettiest passion, nor,
      However deeply in men's spirits skilled,
      Look through thine own, nor curb the lust of War,
    Nor learn that tempted Fate will leave the loftiest Star.

                             XXXIX.

    Yet well thy soul hath brooked the turning tide
      With that untaught innate philosophy,
      Which, be it Wisdom, Coldness, or deep Pride,[hx]
      Is gall and wormwood to an enemy.
      When the whole host of hatred stood hard by,
      To watch and mock thee shrinking, thou hast smiled[hy]
      With a sedate and all-enduring eye;--
      When Fortune fled her spoiled and favourite child,
    He stood unbowed beneath the ills upon him piled.

                              XL.

    Sager than in thy fortunes; for in them[hz]
      Ambition steeled thee on too far to show
      That just habitual scorn, which could contemn
      Men and their thoughts; 'twas wise to feel, not so
      To wear it ever on thy lip and brow,
      And spurn the instruments thou wert to use
      Till they were turned unto thine overthrow:
      'Tis but a worthless world to win or lose;
    So hath it proved to thee, and all such lot who choose.

                              XLI.

    If, like a tower upon a headlong rock,
      Thou hadst been made to stand or fall alone,
      Such scorn of man had helped to brave the shock;
      But men's thoughts were the steps which paved thy throne,
      _Their_ admiration thy best weapon shone;
      The part of Philip's son was thine, not then
      (Unless aside thy Purple had been thrown)
      Like stern Diogenes to mock at men--
    For sceptred Cynics Earth were far too wide a den.[8.B.]

                             XLII.

    But Quiet to quick bosoms is a Hell,
      And _there_ hath been thy bane; there is a fire
      And motion of the Soul which will not dwell
      In its own narrow being, but aspire
      Beyond the fitting medium of desire;
      And, but once kindled, quenchless evermore,
      Preys upon high adventure, nor can tire[ia]
      Of aught but rest; a fever at the core,
    Fatal to him who bears, to all who ever bore.

                             XLIII.

    This makes the madmen who have made men mad
      By their contagion; Conquerors and Kings,
      Founders of sects and systems, to whom add
      Sophists, Bards, Statesmen, all unquiet things
      Which stir too strongly the soul's secret springs,[ib]
      And are themselves the fools to those they fool;
      Envied, yet how unenviable! what stings
      Are theirs! One breast laid open were a school
    Which would unteach Mankind the lust to shine or rule:

                             XLIV.

    Their breath is agitation, and their life
      A storm whereon they ride, to sink at last,
      And yet so nursed and bigoted to strife,
      That should their days, surviving perils past,
      Melt to calm twilight, they feel overcast[ic]
      With sorrow and supineness, and so die;
      Even as a flame unfed, which runs to waste
      With its own flickering, or a sword laid by,
    Which eats into itself, and rusts ingloriously.

                              XLV.

    He who ascends to mountain-tops, shall find
      The loftiest peaks most wrapt in clouds and snow;
      He who surpasses or subdues mankind,
      Must look down on the hate of those below.[id]
      Though high _above_ the Sun of Glory glow,
      And far _beneath_ the Earth and Ocean spread,
      _Round_ him are icy rocks, and loudly blow
      Contending tempests on his naked head,[ie]
    And thus reward the toils which to those summits led.

                             XLVI.

    Away with these! true Wisdom's world will be[if]
      Within its own creation, or in thine,
      Maternal Nature! for who teems like thee,[ig]
      Thus on the banks of thy majestic Rhine?
      There Harold gazes on a work divine,
      A blending of all beauties; streams and dells,
      Fruit, foliage, crag, wood, cornfield, mountain, vine,
      And chiefless castles breathing stern farewells
    From gray but leafy walls, where Ruin greenly dwells.[ih]

                             XLVII.

    And there they stand, as stands a lofty mind,
      Worn, but unstooping to the baser crowd,
      All tenantless, save to the crannying Wind,
      Or holding dark communion with the Cloud
      There was a day when they were young and proud;
      Banners on high, and battles[300] passed below;
      But they who fought are in a bloody shroud,
      And those which waved are shredless dust ere now,[ii]
    And the bleak battlements shall bear no future blow.

                            XLVIII.

    Beneath these battlements, within those walls,
      Power dwelt amidst her passions; in proud state
      Each robber chief upheld his armed halls,
      Doing his evil will, nor less elate
      Than mightier heroes of a longer date.
      What want these outlaws conquerors should have[ij][9.B.]
      But History's purchased page to call them great?
      A wider space--an ornamented grave?
    Their hopes were not less warm, their souls were full as brave.[ik]

                             XLIX.

    In their baronial feuds and single fields,
      What deeds of prowess unrecorded died!
      And Love, which lent a blazon to their shields,[301]
      With emblems well devised by amorous pride,
      Through all the mail of iron hearts would glide;
      But still their flame was fierceness, and drew on
      Keen contest and destruction near allied,
      And many a tower for some fair mischief won,
    Saw the discoloured Rhine beneath its ruin run.

                               L.

    But Thou, exulting and abounding river!
      Making thy waves a blessing as they flow
      Through banks whose beauty would endure for ever
      Could man but leave thy bright creation so,
      Nor its fair promise from the surface mow[il]
      With the sharp scythe of conflict, then to see
      Thy valley of sweet waters, were to know[302]
      Earth paved like Heaven--and to seem such to me,[im]
    Even now what wants thy stream?--that it should Lethe be.

                              LI.

    A thousand battles have assailed thy banks,
      But these and half their fame have passed away,
      And Slaughter heaped on high his weltering ranks:
      Their very graves are gone, and what are they?[303]
      Thy tide washed down the blood of yesterday,
      And all was stainless, and on thy clear stream
      Glassed, with its dancing light, the sunny ray;[in]
      But o'er the blacken'd memory's blighting dream
    Thy waves would vainly roll, all sweeping as they seem.

                              LII.

    Thus Harold inly said, and passed along,
      Yet not insensible to all which here
      Awoke the jocund birds to early song
      In glens which might have made even exile dear:
      Though on his brow were graven lines austere,
      And tranquil sternness, which had ta'en the place
      Of feelings fierier far but less severe--
      Joy was not always absent from his face,
    But o'er it in such scenes would steal with transient trace.

                             LIII.

    Nor was all Love shut from him, though his days
      Of Passion had consumed themselves to dust.
      It is in vain that we would coldly gaze
      On such as smile upon us; the heart must
      Leap kindly back to kindness, though Disgust[io]
      Hath weaned it from all worldlings: thus he felt,
      For there was soft Remembrance, and sweet Trust
      In one fond breast, to which his own would melt,
    And in its tenderer hour on that his bosom dwelt.[304]

                              LIV.

    And he had learned to love,--I know not why,
      For this in such as him seems strange of mood,
      The helpless looks of blooming Infancy,
      Even in its earliest nurture; what subdued,
      To change like this, a mind so far imbued
      With scorn of man, it little boots to know;
      But thus it was; and though in solitude
      Small power the nipped affections have to grow,
    In him this glowed when all beside had ceased to glow.

                              LV.

    And there was one soft breast, as hath been said,[ip]
      Which unto his was bound by stronger ties
      Than the church links withal; and--though unwed,
      _That_ love was pure--and, far above disguise,[iq]
      Had stood the test of mortal enmities
      Still undivided, and cemented more
      By peril, dreaded most in female eyes;[305]
      But this was firm, and from a foreign shore
    Well to that heart might his these absent greetings pour![ir]

                               1.

    The castled Crag of Drachenfels[306][10.B.]
    Frowns o'er the wide and winding Rhine,
    Whose breast of waters broadly swells
    Between the banks which bear the vine,
    And hills all rich with blossomed trees,
    And fields which promise corn and wine,
    And scattered cities crowning these,
    Whose far white walls along them shine,
    Have strewed a scene, which I should see
    With double joy wert _thou_ with me.

                               2.

    And peasant girls, with deep blue eyes,
    And hands which offer early flowers,
    Walk smiling o'er this Paradise;
    Above, the frequent feudal towers
    Through green leaves lift their walls of gray;
    And many a rock which steeply lowers,
    And noble arch in proud decay,
    Look o'er this vale of vintage-bowers;
    But one thing want these banks of Rhine,--
    Thy gentle hand to clasp in mine!

                               3.

    I send the lilies given to me--
    Though long before thy hand they touch,
    I know that they must withered be,
    But yet reject them not as such;
    For I have cherished them as dear,
    Because they yet may meet thine eye,
    And guide thy soul to mine even here,
    When thou behold'st them drooping nigh,
    And know'st them gathered by the Rhine,
    And offered from my heart to thine!

                               4.

    The river nobly foams and flows--
    The charm of this enchanted ground,
    And all its thousand turns disclose
    Some fresher beauty varying round:
    The haughtiest breast its wish might bound
    Through life to dwell delighted here;
    Nor could on earth a spot be found
    To Nature and to me so dear--
    Could thy dear eyes in following mine
    Still sweeten more these banks of Rhine!

                              LVI.

    By Coblentz, on a rise of gentle ground,
      There is a small and simple Pyramid,
      Crowning the summit of the verdant mound;
      Beneath its base are Heroes' ashes hid--
      Our enemy's--but let not that forbid
      Honour to Marceau! o'er whose early tomb[is]
      Tears, big tears, gushed from the rough soldier's lid,
      Lamenting and yet envying such a doom,
    Falling for France, whose rights he battled to resume.

                             LVII.

    Brief, brave, and glorious was his young career,--
      His mourners were two hosts, his friends and foes;
      And fitly may the stranger lingering here
      Pray for his gallant Spirit's bright repose;--
      For he was Freedom's Champion, one of those,
      The few in number, who had not o'erstept[307]
      The charter to chastise which she bestows
      On such as wield her weapons; he had kept
    The whiteness of his soul--and thus men o'er him wept.[11.B.]

                             LVIII.

    Here Ehrenbreitstein,[12.B.] with her shattered wall
      Black with the miner's blast, upon her height
      Yet shows of what she was, when shell and ball
      Rebounding idly on her strength did light:--
      A Tower of Victory! from whence the flight
      Of baffled foes was watched along the plain:
      But Peace destroyed what War could never blight,
      And laid those proud roofs bare to Summer's rain--
    On which the iron shower for years had poured in vain.[308]

                              LIX.

    Adieu to thee, fair Rhine! How long delighted
      The stranger fain would linger on his way!
      Thine is a scene alike where souls united
      Or lonely Contemplation thus might stray;
      And could the ceaseless vultures cease to prey[it]
      On self-condemning bosoms, it were here,
      Where Nature, nor too sombre nor too gay,
      Wild but not rude, awful yet not austere,[iu]
    Is to the mellow Earth as Autumn to the year.[309]

                              LX.

    Adieu to thee again! a vain adieu!
      There can be no farewell to scene like thine;
      The mind is coloured by thy every hue;
      And if reluctantly the eyes resign
      Their cherished gaze upon thee, lovely Rhine!
      'Tis with the thankful glance of parting praise;
      More mighty spots may rise--more glaring shine,[iv]
      But none unite in one attaching maze
    The brilliant, fair, and soft,--the glories of old days,

                              LXI.

    The negligently grand, the fruitful bloom[310]
      Of coming ripeness, the white city's sheen,
      The rolling stream, the precipice's gloom,
      The forest's growth, and Gothic walls between,--
      The wild rocks shaped, as they had turrets been,
      In mockery of man's art; and these withal
      A race of faces happy as the scene,
      Whose fertile bounties here extend to all,
    Still springing o'er thy banks, though Empires near them fall.

                             LXII.

    But these recede. Above me are the Alps,
      The Palaces of Nature, whose vast walls
      Have pinnacled in clouds their snowy scalps,[iw]
      And throned Eternity in icy halls
      Of cold Sublimity, where forms and falls[311]
      The Avalanche--the thunderbolt of snow!
      All that expands the spirit, yet appals,
      Gather around these summits, as to show
    How Earth may pierce to Heaven, yet leave vain man below.

                             LXIII.

    But ere these matchless heights I dare to scan,
      There is a spot should not be passed in vain,--
      Morat! the proud, the patriot field! where man
      May gaze on ghastly trophies of the slain,
      Nor blush for those who conquered on that plain;
      Here Burgundy bequeathed his tombless host,
      A bony heap, through ages to remain,
      Themselves their monument;[312]--the Stygian coast
    Unsepulchred they roamed, and shrieked each
                                           wandering ghost.[ix][313][13.B.]

                             LXIV.

    While Waterloo with Cannae's carnage vies,[314]
      Morat and Marathon twin names shall stand;
      They were true Glory's stainless victories,
      Won by the unambitious heart and hand
      Of a proud, brotherly, and civic band,
      All unbought champions in no princely cause
      Of vice-entailed Corruption; they no land[iy]
      Doomed to bewail the blasphemy of laws
    Making Kings' rights divine, by some Draconic clause.

                              LXV.

    By a lone wall a lonelier column rears
      A gray and grief-worn aspect of old days;
      'Tis the last remnant of the wreck of years,
      And looks as with the wild-bewildered gaze
      Of one to stone converted by amaze,
      Yet still with consciousness; and there it stands
      Making a marvel that it not decays,
      When the coeval pride of human hands,
    Levelled Aventicum,[14.B.] hath strewed her subject lands.

                             LXVI.

    And there--oh! sweet and sacred be the name!--
      Julia--the daughter--the devoted--gave
      Her youth to Heaven; her heart, beneath a claim
      Nearest to Heaven's, broke o'er a father's grave.
      Justice is sworn 'gainst tears, and hers would crave
      The life she lived in--but the Judge was just--
      And then she died on him she could not save.[iz]
      Their tomb was simple, and without a bust,[ja]
    And held within their urn one mind--one heart--one dust.[15.B.]

                             LXVII.

    But these are deeds which should not pass away,
      And names that must not wither, though the Earth
      Forgets her empires with a just decay,
      The enslavers and the enslaved--their death and birth;
      The high, the mountain-majesty of Worth
      Should be--and shall, survivor of its woe,
      And from its immortality, look forth
      In the sun's face, like yonder Alpine snow,[16.B.]
    Imperishably pure beyond all things below.

                            LXVIII.

    Lake Leman woos me with its crystal face,
      The mirror where the stars and mountains view
      The stillness of their aspect in each trace
      Its clear depth yields of their far height and hue:[jb]
      There is too much of Man here,[315] to look through
      With a fit mind the might which I behold;
      But soon in me shall Loneliness renew
      Thoughts hid, but not less cherished than of old,
    Ere mingling with the herd had penned me in their fold.

                             LXIX.

    To fly from, need not be to hate, mankind:
      All are not fit with them to stir and toil,
      Nor is it discontent to keep the mind
      Deep in its fountain, lest it overboil[jc][316]
      In the hot throng, where we become the spoil
      Of our infection, till too late and long
      We may deplore and struggle with the coil,
      In wretched interchange of wrong for wrong
    Midst a contentious world, striving where none are strong.[jd]

                              LXX.

    There, in a moment, we may plunge our years[317]
      In fatal penitence, and in the blight
      Of our own Soul turn all our blood to tears,
      And colour things to come with hues of Night;
      The race of life becomes a hopeless flight
      To those that walk in darkness: on the sea
      The boldest steer but where their ports invite--
      But there are wanderers o'er Eternity[je][318]
    Whose bark drives on and on, and anchored ne'er shall be.

                             LXXI.

    Is it not better, then, to be alone,
      And love Earth only for its earthly sake?
      By the blue rushing of the arrowy[319] Rhone,[17.B.]
      Or the pure bosom of its nursing Lake,
      Which feeds it as a mother who doth make
      A fair but froward infant her own care,
      Kissing its cries away as these awake;--[jf]
      Is it not better thus our lives to wear,
    Than join the crushing crowd, doomed to inflict or bear?

                             LXXII.

    I live not in myself, but I become
      Portion of that around me; and to me
      High mountains are a feeling, but the hum[320]
      Of human cities torture: I can see[jg]
      Nothing to loathe in Nature, save to be[jh]
      A link reluctant in a fleshly chain,
      Classed among creatures, when the soul can flee,
      And with the sky--the peak--the heaving plain[ji]
    Of Ocean, or the stars, mingle--and not in vain.

                            LXXIII.

    And thus I am absorbed, and this is life:--
      I look upon the peopled desert past,
      As on a place of agony and strife,
      Where, for some sin, to Sorrow I was cast,
      To act and suffer, but remount at last[jj]
      With a fresh pinion; which I feel to spring,
      Though young, yet waxing vigorous as the Blast
      Which it would cope with, on delighted wing,
    Spurning the clay-cold bonds which round our being cling.[jk][321]

                             LXXIV.

    And when, at length, the mind shall be all free
      From what it hates in this degraded form,[jl]
      Reft of its carnal life, save what shall be
      Existent happier in the fly and worm,--
      When Elements to Elements conform,
      And dust is as it should be, shall I not
      Feel all I see less dazzling but more warm?
      The bodiless thought? the Spirit of each spot?[jm]
    Of which, even now, I share at times the immortal lot?[322]

                             LXXV.

    Are not the mountains, waves, and skies, a part[jn]
      Of me and of my Soul, as I of them?
      Is not the love of these deep in my heart
      With a pure passion? should I not contemn
      All objects, if compared with these? and stem
      A tide of suffering, rather than forego
      Such feelings for the hard and worldly phlegm
      Of those whose eyes are only turned below,
    Gazing upon the ground, with thoughts which dare not glow?[jo][323]

                             LXXVI.

    But this is not my theme; and I return[jp]
      To that which is immediate, and require
      Those who find contemplation in the urn,
      To look on One, whose dust was once all fire,--
      A native of the land where I respire
      The clear air for a while--a passing guest,
      Where he became a being,--whose desire
      Was to be glorious; 'twas a foolish quest,
    The which to gain and keep, he sacrificed all rest.

                            LXXVII.

    Here the self-torturing sophist, wild Rousseau,[jq]
      The apostle of Affliction, he who threw
      Enchantment over Passion, and from Woe
      Wrung overwhelming eloquence, first drew
      The breath which made him wretched; yet he knew
      How to make Madness beautiful, and cast
      O'er erring deeds and thoughts, a heavenly hue[jr]
      Of words, like sunbeams, dazzling as they past
    The eyes, which o'er them shed tears feelingly and fast.

                            LXXVIII.

    His love was Passion's essence--as a tree
      On fire by lightning; with ethereal flame
      Kindled he was, and blasted; for to be
      Thus, and enamoured, were in him the same.[js]
      But his was not the love of living dame,
      Nor of the dead who rise upon our dreams,
      But of ideal Beauty, which became
      In him existence, and o'erflowing teems
    Along his burning page, distempered though it seems.

                             LXXIX.

    _This_ breathed itself to life in Julie, _this_
      Invested her with all that's wild and sweet;
      This hallowed, too, the memorable kiss[18.B.]
      Which every morn his fevered lip would greet,
      From hers, who but with friendship his would meet;
      But to that gentle touch, through brain and breast
      Flashed the thrilled Spirit's love-devouring heat;[jt]
      In that absorbing sigh perchance more blest
    Than vulgar minds may be with all they seek possest.

                             LXXX.

    His life was one long war with self-sought foes,
      Or friends by him self-banished;[324] for his mind
      Had grown Suspicion's sanctuary, and chose,
      For its own cruel sacrifice, the kind,[ju]
      'Gainst whom he raged with fury strange and blind.
      But he was phrensied, wherefore, who may know?
      Since cause might be which Skill could never find;[jv]
      But he was phrensied by disease or woe,
    To that worst pitch of all, which wears a reasoning show.

                             LXXXI.

    For then he was inspired,[325] and from him came,
      As from the Pythian's mystic cave of yore,
      Those oracles which set the world in flame,[326]
      Nor ceased to burn till kingdoms were no more:
      Did he not this for France? which lay before
      Bowed to the inborn tyranny of years?[327]
      Broken and trembling to the yoke she bore,
      Till by the voice of him and his compeers,
    Roused up to too much wrath which follows o'ergrown fears?

                            LXXXII.

    They made themselves a fearful monument!
      The wreck of old opinions--things which grew,[jw]
      Breathed from the birth of Time: the veil they rent,
      And what behind it lay, all earth shall view.[jx]
      But good with ill they also overthrew,
      Leaving but ruins, wherewith to rebuild
      Upon the same foundation, and renew
      Dungeons and thrones, which the same hour refilled,
    As heretofore, because Ambition was self-willed.

                            LXXXIII.

    But this will not endure, nor be endured!
      Mankind have felt their strength, and made it felt.
      They might have used it better, but, allured
      By their new vigour, sternly have they dealt
      On one another; Pity ceased to melt
      With her once natural charities. But they,
      Who in Oppression's darkness caved had dwelt,
      They were not eagles, nourished with the day;
    What marvel then, at times, if they mistook their prey?

                            LXXXIV.

    What deep wounds ever closed without a scar?
      The heart's bleed longest, and but heal to wear
      That which disfigures it; and they who war
      With their own hopes, and have been vanquished, bear
      Silence, but not submission: in his lair
      Fixed Passion holds his breath, until the hour
      Which shall atone for years; none need despair:
      It came--it cometh--and will come,--the power
    To punish or forgive--in _one_ we shall be slower.[jy][328]

                             LXXXV.

    Clear, placid Leman! thy contrasted lake,
      With the wild world I dwelt in, is a thing
      Which warns me, with its stillness, to forsake
      Earth's troubled waters for a purer spring.
      This quiet sail is as a noiseless wing
      To waft me from distraction; once I loved
      Torn Ocean's roar, but thy soft murmuring
      Sounds sweet as if a Sister's voice reproved,
    That I with stern delights should e'er have been so moved.

                            LXXXVI.

    It is the hush of night, and all between
      Thy margin and the mountains, dusk, yet clear,
      Mellowed and mingling, yet distinctly seen,
      Save darkened Jura,[329] whose capt heights appear
      Precipitously steep; and drawing near,
      There breathes a living fragrance from the shore,
      Of flowers yet fresh with childhood; on the ear
      Drops the light drip of the suspended oar,
    Or chirps the grasshopper one good-night carol more.

                            LXXXVII.

    He is an evening reveller, who makes[jz]
      His life an infancy, and sings his fill;[ka][330]
      At intervals, some bird from out the brakes
      Starts into voice a moment, then is still.
      There seems a floating whisper on the hill,
      But that is fancy--for the Starlight dews
      All silently their tears of Love instil,
      Weeping themselves away, till they infuse
    Deep into Nature's breast the spirit of her hues.[kb]

                           LXXXVIII.

    Ye Stars! which are the poetry of Heaven!
      If in your bright leaves we would read the fate
      Of men and empires,--'tis to be forgiven,
      That in our aspirations to be great,
      Our destinies o'erleap their mortal state,
      And claim a kindred with you; for ye are
      A Beauty and a Mystery, and create
      In us such love and reverence from afar,
    That Fortune,--Fame,--Power,--Life, have named themselves a Star.[331]

                            LXXXIX.

    All Heaven and Earth are still--though not in sleep,
      But breathless, as we grow when feeling most;[332]
      And silent, as we stand in thoughts too deep:--
      All Heaven and Earth are still: From the high host
      Of stars, to the lulled lake and mountain-coast,
      All is concentered in a life intense,
      Where not a beam, nor air, nor leaf is lost,
      But hath a part of Being, and a sense
    Of that which is of all Creator and Defence.[333]

                              XC.

    Then stirs the feeling infinite, so felt[kc]
      In solitude, where we are _least_ alone;
      A truth, which through our being then doth melt,
      And purifies from self: it is a tone,
      The soul and source of Music, which makes known[kd]
      Eternal harmony, and sheds a charm
      Like to the fabled Cytherea's zone,[334]
      Binding all things with beauty;--'twould disarm
    The spectre Death, had he substantial power to harm.

                              XCI.

    Not vainly did the early Persian make[335]
      His altar the high places, and the peak
      Of earth-o'ergazing mountains,[19.B.] --and thus take
      A fit and unwalled temple, there to seek
      The Spirit, in whose honour shrines are weak
      Upreared of human hands. Come, and compare
      Columns and idol-dwellings--Goth or Greek--
      With Nature's realms of worship, earth and air--
    Nor fix on fond abodes to circumscribe thy prayer!

                             XCII.

    The sky is changed!--and such a change! Oh Night,[20.B.]
      And Storm, and Darkness, ye are wondrous strong,
      Yet lovely in your strength, as is the light
      Of a dark eye in Woman![336] Far along,
      From peak to peak, the rattling crags among
      Leaps the live thunder! Not from one lone cloud,
      But every mountain now hath found a tongue,
      And Jura answers, through her misty shroud,
    Back to the joyous Alps, who call to her aloud!

                             XCIII.

    And this is in the Night:--Most glorious Night![ke]
      Thou wert not sent for slumber! let me be
      A sharer in thy fierce and far delight,--
      A portion of the tempest and of thee![kf]
      How the lit lake shines, a phosphoric sea,[kg]
      And the big rain comes dancing to the earth!
      And now again 'tis black,--and now, the glee
      Of the loud hills shakes with its mountain-mirth,
    As if they did rejoice o'er a young Earthquake's birth.[kh]

                             XCIV.

    Now, where the swift Rhone cleaves his way between
      Heights which appear as lovers who have parted[ki][337]
      In hate, whose mining depths so intervene,
      That they can meet no more, though broken-hearted:
      Though in their souls, which thus each other thwarted,
      Love was the very root of the fond rage
      Which blighted their life's bloom, and then departed:--
      Itself expired, but leaving them an age
    Of years all winters,--war within themselves to wage:[kj]

                              XCV.

    Now, where the quick Rhone thus hath cleft his way,
      The mightiest of the storms hath ta'en his stand:
      For here, not one, but many, make their play,
      And fling their thunder-bolts from hand to hand,
      Flashing and cast around: of all the band,
      The brightest through these parted hills hath forked
      His lightnings,--as if he did understand,
      That in such gaps as Desolation worked,
    There the hot shaft should blast whatever therein lurked.

                             XCVI.

    Sky--Mountains--River--Winds--Lake--Lightnings! ye!
      With night, and clouds, and thunder--and a Soul
      To make these felt and feeling, well may be
      Things that have made me watchful; the far roll
      Of your departing voices, is the knoll[338]
      Of what in me is sleepless,--if I rest.
      But where of ye, O Tempests! is the goal?
      Are ye like those within the human breast?
    Or do ye find, at length, like eagles, some high nest?

                             XCVII.

    Could I embody and unbosom now
      That which is most within me,--could I wreak
      My thoughts upon expression, and thus throw
      Soul--heart--mind--passions--feelings--strong or weak--
      All that I would have sought, and all I seek,
      Bear, know, feel--and yet breathe--into _one_ word,
      And that one word were Lightning, I would speak;
      But as it is, I live and die unheard,
    With a most voiceless thought, sheathing it as a sword.

                            XCVIII.

    The Morn is up again, the dewy Morn,
      With breath all incense, and with cheek all bloom--
      Laughing the clouds away with playful scorn,
      And living as if earth contained no tomb,--
      And glowing into day: we may resume
      The march of our existence: and thus I,
      Still on thy shores, fair Leman! may find room
      And food for meditation, nor pass by
    Much, that may give us pause, if pondered fittingly.

                             XCIX.

    Clarens! sweet Clarens[339] birthplace of deep Love!
      Thine air is the young breath of passionate Thought;
      Thy trees take root in Love; the snows above,[kk]
      The very Glaciers have his colours caught,
      And Sun-set into rose-hues sees them wrought[21.B.]
      By rays which sleep there lovingly: the rocks,[kl]
      The permanent crags, tell here of Love, who sought
      In them a refuge from the worldly shocks,
    Which stir and sting the Soul with Hope that woos, then mocks.

                               C.

    Clarens! by heavenly feet thy paths are trod,--[km]
      Undying Love's, who here ascends a throne
      To which the steps are mountains; where the God
      Is a pervading Life and Light,--so shown[kn]
      Not on those summits solely, nor alone
      In the still cave and forest; o'er the flower
      His eye is sparkling, and his breath hath blown,
      His soft and summer breath, whose tender power[ko]
    Passes the strength of storms in their most desolate hour.

                              CI.

    All things are here of _Him_; from the black pines,[340]
      Which are his shade on high, and the loud roar
      Of torrents, where he listeneth, to the vines
      Which slope his green path downward to the shore,
      Where the bowed Waters meet him, and adore,
      Kissing his feet with murmurs; and the Wood,
      The covert of old trees, with trunks all hoar,
      But light leaves, young as joy, stands where it stood,[kp]
    Offering to him, and his, a populous solitude.

                              CII.

    A populous solitude of bees and birds,
      And fairy-formed and many-coloured things,
      Who worship him with notes more sweet than words,[kq]
      And innocently open their glad wings,
      Fearless and full of life: the gush of springs,
      And fall of lofty fountains, and the bend
      Of stirring branches, and the bud which brings
      The swiftest thought of Beauty, here extend
    Mingling--and made by Love--unto one mighty end.

                             CIII.

    He who hath loved not, here would learn that lore,[341]
      And make his heart a spirit; he who knows
      That tender mystery, will love the more;
      For this is Love's recess, where vain men's woes,
      And the world's waste, have driven him far from those,[kr]
      For 'tis his nature to advance or die;
      He stands not still, but or decays, or grows
      Into a boundless blessing, which may vie
    With the immortal lights, in its eternity!

                              CIV.

    'Twas not for fiction chose Rousseau this spot,
      Peopling it with affections; but he found
      It was the scene which Passion must allot
      To the Mind's purified beings; 'twas the ground
      Where early Love his Psyche's zone unbound,[342]
      And hallowed it with loveliness: 'tis lone,
      And wonderful, and deep, and hath a sound,
      And sense, and sight of sweetness; here the Rhone
    Hath spread himself a couch, the Alps have reared a throne.

                              CV.

    Lausanne! and Ferney! ye have been the abodes
      Of Names which unto you bequeathed a name;[22.B.]
      Mortals, who sought and found, by dangerous roads,
      A path to perpetuity of Fame:
      They were gigantic minds, and their steep aim
      Was, Titan-like, on daring doubts to pile
      Thoughts which should call down thunder, and the flame
      Of Heaven again assailed--if Heaven, the while,
    On man and man's research could deign do more than smile.

                              CVI.

    The one was fire and fickleness,[343] a child
      Most mutable in wishes, but in mind
      A wit as various,--gay, grave, sage, or wild,--
      Historian, bard, philosopher, combined;[ks]
      He multiplied himself among mankind,
      The Proteus of their talents: But his own
      Breathed most in ridicule,--which, as the wind,
      Blew where it listed, laying all things prone,--
    Now to o'erthrow a fool, and now to shake a throne.[344]

                             CVII.

    The other, deep and slow, exhausting thought,[kt]
      And hiving wisdom with each studious year,
      In meditation dwelt--with learning wrought,
      And shaped his weapon with an edge severe,
      Sapping a solemn creed with solemn sneer;
      The lord of irony,--that master-spell,
      Which stung his foes to wrath, which grew from fear[ku][345]
      And doomed him to the zealot's ready Hell,
    Which answers to all doubts so eloquently well.

                             CVIII.

    Yet, peace be with their ashes,--for by them,
      If merited, the penalty is paid;
      It is not ours to judge,--far less condemn;
      The hour must come when such things shall be made
      Known unto all,--or hope and dread allayed
      By slumber, on one pillow, in the dust,[kv]
      Which, thus much we are sure, must lie decayed;
      And when it shall revive, as is our trust,[346]
    'Twill be to be forgiven--or suffer what is just.

                              CIX.

    But let me quit Man's works, again to read
      His Maker's, spread around me, and suspend
      This page, which from my reveries I feed,
      Until it seems prolonging without end.
      The clouds above me to the white Alps tend,
      And I must pierce them, and survey whate'er[347]
      May be permitted, as my steps I bend
      To their most great and growing region, where
    The earth to her embrace compels the powers of air.

    Italia too! Italia! looking on thee,
      Full flashes on the Soul the light of ages,
      Since the fierce Carthaginian almost won thee,
      To the last halo of the Chiefs and Sages
      Who glorify thy consecrated pages;
      Thou wert the throne and grave of empires; still,[348]
      The fount at which the panting Mind assuages
      Her thirst of knowledge, quaffing there her fill,
    Flows from the eternal source of Rome's imperial hill.

                              CXI.

    Thus far have I proceeded in a theme
      Renewed with no kind auspices:--to feel
      We are not what we have been, and to deem
      We are not what we should be,--and to steel
      The heart against itself; and to conceal,
      With a proud caution, love, or hate, or aught,--
      Passion or feeling, purpose, grief, or zeal,--
      Which is the tyrant Spirit of our thought,
    Is a stern task of soul:--No matter,--it is taught.[349]

    And for these words, thus woven into song,
      It may be that they are a harmless wile,--[kw]
      The colouring of the scenes which fleet along,[kx]
      Which I would seize, in passing, to beguile
      My breast, or that of others, for a while.
      Fame is the thirst of youth,--but I am not[ky]
      So young as to regard men's frown or smile,
      As loss or guerdon of a glorious lot;--
    I stood and stand alone,--remembered or forgot.

                             CXIII.

    I have not loved the World, nor the World me;
      I have not flattered its rank breath,[350] nor bowed
      To its idolatries a patient knee,
      Nor coined my cheek to smiles,--nor cried aloud
      In worship of an echo: in the crowd
      They could not deem me one of such--I stood
      Among them, but not of them[351]--in a shroud
      Of thoughts which were not their thoughts, and still could,
    Had I not filed my mind, which thus itself subdued.[23.B.]

    I have not loved the World, nor the World me,--
      But let us part fair foes; I do believe,
      Though I have found them not, that there may be
      Words which are things,--hopes which will not deceive,
      And Virtues which are merciful, nor weave
      Snares for the failing; I would also deem
      O'er others' griefs that some sincerely grieve--[kz][24.B.]
      That two, or one, are almost what they seem,--
    That Goodness is no name--and Happiness no dream.

      My voice shall with thy future visions blend,
      And reach into thy heart,--when mine is cold,--
    A token and a tone, even from thy father's mould.

                             CXVI.

    To aid thy mind's developement,--to watch
      Thy dawn of little joys,--to sit and see
      Almost thy very growth,--to view thee catch
      Knowledge of objects,--wonders yet to thee!
      To hold thee lightly on a gentle knee,
      And print on thy soft cheek a parent's kiss,--
      This, it should seem, was not reserved for me--
      Yet this was in my nature:--as it is,
    I know not what is there, yet something like to this.

                             CXVII.

    Yet, though dull Hate as duty should be taught,[353]
      I know that thou wilt love me: though my name
      Should be shut from thee, as a spell still fraught
      With desolation, and a broken claim:
      Though the grave closed between us,--'twere the same,
      I know that thou wilt love me--though to drain[354]
      _My_ blood from out thy being were an aim,
      And an attainment,--all would be in vain,--
    Still thou would'st love me, still that more than life retain.

                            CXVIII.

    The child of Love![355] though born in bitterness,
      And nurtured in Convulsion! Of thy sire
      These were the elements,--and thine no less.
      As yet such are around thee,--but thy fire
      Shall be more tempered, and thy hope far higher!
      Sweet be thy cradled slumbers! O'er the sea
      And from the mountains where I now respire,
      Fain would I waft such blessing upon thee,
    As--with a sigh--I deem thou might'st have been to me![la]

CANTO THE FOURTH[375]

                               I.

    I stood in Venice, on the "Bridge of Sighs;"[376][1.H.]
      A Palace and a prison on each hand:
      I saw from out the wave her structures rise
      As from the stroke of the Enchanter's wand:[377]
      A thousand Years their cloudy wings expand
      Around me, and a dying Glory smiles
      O'er the far times, when many a subject land
      Looked to the winged Lion's marble piles,
    Where Venice sate in state, throned on her hundred isles![lb]

                              II.

    She looks a sea Cybele,[378] fresh from Ocean,
      Rising with her tiara of proud towers
      At airy distance, with majestic motion,
      A Ruler of the waters and their powers:
      And such she was;--her daughters had their dowers
      From spoils of nations, and the exhaustless East[lc]
      Poured in her lap all gems in sparkling showers.[379]
      In purple was she robed,[380] and of her feast
    Monarchs partook, and deemed their dignity increased.[ld]

                              III.

    In Venice Tasso's echoes are no more,[2.H.]
      And silent rows the songless Gondolier;[381]
      Her palaces are crumbling to the shore,
      And Music meets not always now the ear:
      Those days are gone--but Beauty still is here.
      States fall--Arts fade--but Nature doth not die,
      Nor yet forget how Venice once was dear,
      The pleasant place of all festivity,[le]
    The Revel of the earth--the Masque of Italy!

                              IV.

    But unto us she hath a spell beyond
      Her name in story, and her long array
      Of mighty shadows, whose dim forms despond
      Above the Dogeless city's vanished sway;
      Ours is a trophy which will not decay
      With the Rialto;[382] Shylock and the Moor,
      And Pierre,[383] can not be swept or worn away--
      The keystones of the Arch! though all were o'er,
    For us repeopled were the solitary shore.

                               V.

    The Beings of the Mind are not of clay:
      Essentially immortal, they create
      And multiply in us a brighter ray
      And more beloved existence:[384] that which Fate
      Prohibits to dull life in this our state[lf]
      Of mortal bondage, by these Spirits supplied,
      First exiles, then replaces what we hate;
      Watering the heart whose early flowers have died,
    And with a fresher growth replenishing the void.

                              VI.

    Such is the refuge of our youth and age--
      The first from Hope, the last from Vacancy;[385]
      And this wan feeling peoples many a page--[lg]
      And, may be, that which grows beneath mine eye:[lh]
      Yet there are things whose strong reality
      Outshines our fairy-land; in shape and hues[li]
      More beautiful than our fantastic sky,
      And the strange constellations which the Muse
    O'er her wild universe is skilful to diffuse:

                              VII.

    I saw or dreamed of such,--but let them go,--
      They came like Truth--and disappeared like dreams;
      And whatsoe'er they were--are now but so:
      I could replace them if I would; still teems
      My mind with many a form which aptly seems
      Such as I sought for, and at moments found;
      Let these too go--for waking Reason deems
      Such over-weening phantasies unsound,
    And other voices speak, and other sights surround.

                             VIII.

    I've taught me other tongues--and in strange eyes
      Have made me not a stranger; to the mind
      Which is itself, no changes bring surprise;
      Nor is it harsh to make, nor hard to find
      A country with--aye, or without mankind;
      Yet was I born where men are proud to be,--
      Not without cause; and should I leave behind[lj]
      The inviolate Island of the sage and free,
    And seek me out a home by a remoter sea,[lk]

                              IX.

    Perhaps I loved it well; and should I lay
      My ashes in a soil which is not mine,
      My Spirit shall resume it--if we may[ll]
      Unbodied choose a sanctuary.[386] I twine
      My hopes of being remembered in my line
      With my land's language: if too fond and far
      These aspirations in their scope incline,--
      If my Fame should be, as my fortunes are,
    Of hasty growth and blight, and dull Oblivion bar

                               X.

    My name from out the temple where the dead
      Are honoured by the Nations--let it be--
      And light the Laurels on a loftier head!
      And be the Spartan's epitaph on me--
      "Sparta hath many a worthier son than he."[387]
      Meantime I seek no sympathies, nor need--
      The thorns which I have reaped are of the tree
      I planted,--they have torn me,--and I bleed:
    I should have known what fruit would spring from such a seed.

                              XI.

    The spouseless Adriatic mourns her Lord,[lm]
      And annual marriage now no more renewed--
      The Bucentaur[388] lies rotting unrestored,
      Neglected garment of her widowhood!
      St. Mark yet sees his Lion[389] where he stood[3.H.]
      Stand, but in mockery of his withered power,
      Over the proud Place where an Emperor sued,[ln][390]
      And monarchs gazed and envied in the hour
    When Venice was a Queen with an unequalled dower.

                              XII.

    The Suabian sued, and now the Austrian reigns--[4.H.]
      An Emperor tramples where an Emperor knelt;
      Kingdoms are shrunk to provinces, and chains
      Clank over sceptred cities; Nations melt
      From Power's high pinnacle, when they have felt
      The sunshine for a while, and downward go
      Like Lauwine loosened from the mountain's belt;
      Oh for one hour of blind old Dandolo![391][5.H.]
    Th' octogenarian chief, Byzantium's conquering foe.[lo][392]

                             XIII.

    Before St. Mark still glow his Steeds of brass,
      Their gilded collars glittering in the sun;
      But is not Doria's menace[393] come to pass?[6.H.]
      Are they not bridled?--Venice, lost and won,
      Her thirteen hundred years of freedom done,
      Sinks, like a sea-weed, unto whence she rose![lp][394]
      Better be whelmed beneath the waves, and shun,
      Even in Destruction's depth, her foreign foes,[lq]
    From whom Submission wrings an infamous repose.

                              XIV.

    In youth She was all glory,--a new Tyre,--
      Her very by-word sprung from Victory,
      The "Planter of the Lion,"[395] which through fire
      And blood she bore o'er subject Earth and Sea;
      Though making many slaves, Herself still free,
      And Europe's bulwark 'gainst the Ottomite;[396]
      Witness Troy's rival, Candia![397] Vouch it, ye
      Immortal waves that saw Lepanto's fight![398]
    For ye are names no Time nor Tyranny can blight.

                              XV.

    Statues of glass--all shivered--the long file
      Of her dead Doges are declined to dust;
      But where they dwelt, the vast and sumptuous pile
      Bespeaks the pageant of their splendid trust;
      Their sceptre broken, and their sword in rust,
      Have yielded to the stranger: empty halls,
      Thin streets, and foreign aspects, such as must
      Too oft remind her who and what enthrals,[7.H.]
    Have flung a desolate cloud o'er Venice' lovely walls.

                              XVI.

    When Athens' armies fell at Syracuse,
      And fettered thousands bore the yoke of war,
      Redemption rose up in the Attic Muse,[399]
      Her voice their only ransom from afar:[lr]
      See! as they chant the tragic hymn, the car
      Of the o'ermastered Victor stops--the reins
      Fall from his hands--his idle scimitar
      Starts from its belt--he rends his captive's chains,
    And bids him thank the Bard for Freedom and his strains.[ls]

                             XVII.

    Thus, Venice! if no stronger claim were thine,
      Were all thy proud historic deeds forgot--
      Thy choral memory of the Bard divine,
      Thy love of Tasso, should have cut the knot[lt]
      Which ties thee to thy tyrants; and thy lot
      Is shameful to the nations,--most of all,
      Albion! to thee:[400] the Ocean queen should not
      Abandon Ocean's children; in the fall
    Of Venice think of thine, despite thy watery wall.[lu]

                             XVIII.

    I loved her from my boyhood--she to me
      Was as a fairy city of the heart,
      Rising like water-columns from the sea--
      Of Joy the sojourn, and of Wealth the mart;
      And Otway, Radcliffe, Schiller, Shakespeare's art,[lv][401]
      Had stamped her image in me, and even so,
      Although I found her thus, we did not part;[lw]
      Perchance even dearer in her day of woe,
    Than when she was a boast, a marvel, and a show.

                              XIX.

    I can repeople with the past--and of
      The present there is still for eye and thought,
      And meditation chastened down, enough;
      And more, it may be, than I hoped or sought;
      And of the happiest moments which were wrought
      Within the web of my existence, some
      From thee, fair Venice![402] have their colours caught:
      There are some feelings Time can not benumb,[lx]
    Nor Torture shake, or mine would now be cold and dumb.

                              XX.

    But from their nature will the Tannen[403] grow[ly]
      Loftiest on loftiest and least sheltered rocks,
      Rooted in barrenness, where nought below
      Of soil supports them 'gainst the Alpine shocks
      Of eddying storms; yet springs the trunk, and mocks
      The howling tempest, till its height and frame
      Are worthy of the mountains from whose blocks
      Of bleak, gray granite into life it came,[lz]
    And grew a giant tree;--the Mind may grow the same.

                              XXI.

    Existence may be borne, and the deep root
      Of life and sufferance make its firm abode
      In bare and desolated bosoms: mute[ma]
      The camel labours with the heaviest load,
      And the wolf dies in silence--not bestowed
      In vain should such example be; if they,
      Things of ignoble or of savage mood,
      Endure and shrink not, we of nobler clay
    May temper it to bear,--it is but for a day.

                             XXII.

    All suffering doth destroy, or is destroyed,[404]
      Even by the sufferer--and, in each event,
      Ends:--Some, with hope replenished and rebuoyed,
      Return to whence they came--with like intent,
      And weave their web again; some, bowed and bent,
      Wax gray and ghastly, withering ere their time,
      And perish with the reed on which they leant;
      Some seek devotion--toil--war--good or crime,
    According as their souls were formed to sink or climb.

                             XXIII.

    But ever and anon of griefs subdued
      There comes a token like a Scorpion's sting,
      Scarce seen, but with fresh bitterness imbued;
      And slight withal may be the things which bring
      Back on the heart the weight which it would fling
      Aside for ever: it may be a sound--[405]
      A tone of music--summer's eve--or spring--[mb]
      A flower--the wind--the Ocean--which shall wound,
    Striking the electric chain wherewith we are darkly bound;

                             XXIV.

    And how and why we know not, nor can trace
      Home to its cloud this lightning of the mind,
      But feel the shock renewed, nor can efface
      The blight and blackening which it leaves behind,
      Which out of things familiar, undesigned,
      When least we deem of such, calls up to view
      The Spectres whom no exorcism can bind,--
      The cold--the changed--perchance the dead, anew--
    The mourned--the loved--the lost--too many! yet how few![406]

                              XXV.

    But my Soul wanders; I demand it back
      To meditate amongst decay, and stand
      A ruin amidst ruins; there to track
      Fall'n states and buried greatness, o'er a land
      Which _was_ the mightiest in its old command,
      And _is_ the loveliest, and must ever be
      The master-mould of Nature's heavenly hand;
      Wherein were cast the heroic and the free,--
    The beautiful--the brave--the Lords of earth and sea,

                             XXVI.

    The Commonwealth of Kings--the Men of Rome!
      And even since, and now, fair Italy!
      Thou art the Garden of the World, the Home
      Of all Art yields, and Nature can decree;
      Even in thy desert, what is like to thee?
      Thy very weeds are beautiful--thy waste
      More rich than other climes' fertility;
      Thy wreck a glory--and thy ruin graced
    With an immaculate charm which cannot be defaced.

                             XXVII.

    The Moon is up, and yet it is not night--
      Sunset divides the sky with her--a sea
      Of glory streams along the Alpine height
      Of blue Friuli's mountains;[407] Heaven is free
      From clouds, but of all colours seems to be,--
      Melted to one vast Iris of the West,--
      Where the Day joins the past Eternity;
      While, on the other hand, meek Dian's crest
    Floats through the azure air--an island of the blest![408]

                            XXVIII.

    A single star is at her side, and reigns
      With her o'er half the lovely heaven; but still
      Yon sunny Sea heaves brightly, and remains
      Rolled o'er the peak of the far Rhaetian hill,
      As Day and Night contending were, until
      Nature reclaimed her order:--gently flows
      The deep-dyed Brenta,[409] where their hues instil
      The odorous purple of a new-born rose,
    Which streams upon her stream, and glassed within it glows,

                             XXIX.

    Filled with the face of heaven, which, from afar,
      Comes down upon the waters! all its hues,
      From the rich sunset to the rising star,
      Their magical variety diffuse:
      And now they change--a paler Shadow strews
      Its mantle o'er the mountains; parting Day
      Dies like the Dolphin, whom each pang imbues
      With a new colour as it gasps away--
    The last still loveliest, till--'tis gone--and all is gray.

                              XXX.

    There is a tomb in Arqua;--reared in air,
      Pillared in their sarcophagus, repose
      The bones of Laura's lover: here repair
      Many familiar with his well-sung woes,
      The Pilgrims of his Genius. He arose
      To raise a language, and his land reclaim
      From the dull yoke of her barbaric foes:
      Watering the tree which bears his Lady's name[410][8.H.]
    With his melodious tears, he gave himself to Fame.

                             XXXI.

    They keep his dust in Arqua,[411] where he died--[9.H.]
      The mountain-village where his latter days
      Went down the vale of years; and 'tis their pride--
      An honest pride--and let it be their praise,
      To offer to the passing stranger's gaze
      His mansion and his sepulchre--both plain[mc]
      And venerably simple--such as raise
      A feeling more accordant with his strain
    Than if a Pyramid formed his monumental fane.[md]

                             XXXII.

    And the soft quiet hamlet where he dwelt
      Is one of that complexion which seems made
      For those who their mortality[412] have felt,
      And sought a refuge from their hopes decayed
      In the deep umbrage of a green hill's shade,
      Which shows a distant prospect far away
      Of busy cities, now in vain displayed,
      For they can lure no further; and the ray[413]
    Of a bright Sun can make sufficient holiday,

                            XXXIII.

    Developing the mountains, leaves, and flowers,
      And shining in the brawling brook, where-by,
      Clear as its current, glide the sauntering hours
      With a calm languor, which, though to the eye
      Idlesse it seem, hath its morality--
      If from society we learn to live,[me]
      'Tis Solitude should teach us how to die;
      It hath no flatterers--Vanity can give
    No hollow aid; alone--man with his God must strive:[mf]

                             XXXIV.

    Or, it may be, with Demons,[414] who impair
      The strength of better thoughts, and seek their prey
      In melancholy bosoms--such as were
      Of moody texture from their earliest day,
      And loved to dwell in darkness and dismay
      Deeming themselves predestined to a doom
      Which is not of the pangs that pass away;[mg]
      Making the Sun like blood, the Earth a tomb,
    The tomb a hell--and Hell itself a murkier gloom.[mh]

                             XXXV.

    Ferrara![415] in thy wide and grass-grown streets,
      Whose symmetry was not for solitude,
      There seems as 'twere a curse upon the Seats
      Of former Sovereigns, and the antique brood
      Of Este,[416] which for many an age made good
      Its strength within thy walls, and was of yore
      Patron or Tyrant, as the changing mood
      Of petty power impelled, of those who wore
    The wreath which Dante's brow alone had worn before.

                             XXXVI.

    And Tasso is their glory and their shame--
      Hark to his strain! and then survey his cell![417]
      And see how dearly earned Torquato's fame,
      And where Alfonso bade his poet dwell:
      The miserable Despot could not quell
      The insulted mind he sought to quench, and blend
      With the surrounding maniacs, in the hell
      Where he had plunged it. Glory without end
    Scattered the clouds away--and on that name attend

                            XXXVII.

    The tears and praises of all time, while thine
      Would rot in its oblivion--in the sink
      Of worthless dust, which from thy boasted line
      Is shaken into nothing--but the link
      Thou formest in his fortunes bids us think
      Of thy poor malice, naming thee with scorn:
      Alfonso! how thy ducal pageants shrink
      From thee! if in another station born,[mi]
    Scarce fit to be the slave of him thou mad'st to mourn:

                            XXXVIII.

    _Thou!_ formed to eat, and be despised, and die,
      Even as the beasts that perish--save that thou
      Hadst a more splendid trough and wider sty:--
      _He!_ with a glory round his furrowed brow,
      Which emanated then, and dazzles now,
      In face of all his foes, the Cruscan quire,[418][10.H.]
      And Boileau, whose rash envy could allow[mj]
      No strain which shamed his country's creaking lyre,
    That whetstone of the teeth--Monotony in wire![mk][419]

                             XXXIX.

    Peace to Torquato's injured shade! 'twas his
      In life and death to be the mark where Wrong
      Aimed with her poisoned arrows,--but to miss.
      Oh, Victor unsurpassed in modern song!
      Each year brings forth its millions--but how long
      The tide of Generations shall roll on,
      And not the whole combined and countless throng
      Compose a mind like thine? though all in one[ml]
    Condensed their scattered rays--they would not form a Sun.[mm]

                              XL.

    Great as thou art, yet paralleled by those,
      Thy countrymen, before thee born to shine,
      The Bards of Hell and Chivalry: first rose
      The Tuscan Father's Comedy Divine;
      Then, not unequal to the Florentine,
      The southern Scott, the minstrel who called forth
      A new creation with his magic line,
      And, like the Ariosto of the North,[420]
    Sang Ladye-love and War, Romance and Knightly Worth.

                              XLI.

    The lightning rent from Ariosto's bust[11.H.]
      The iron crown of laurel's mimicked leaves;
      Nor was the ominous element unjust,
      For the true laurel-wreath which Glory weaves[12.H.]
      Is of the tree no bolt of thunder cleaves,
      And the false semblance but disgraced his brow;
      Yet still, if fondly Superstition grieves,
      Know, that the lightning sanctifies below[13.H.]
    Whate'er it strikes;--yon head is doubly sacred now.

                             XLII.

    Italia! oh, Italia! thou who hast[421]
      The fatal gift of Beauty, which became
      A funeral dower of present woes and past--
      On thy sweet brow is sorrow ploughed by shame,[mn]
      And annals graved in characters of flame.
      Oh, God! that thou wert in thy nakedness
      Less lovely or more powerful, and couldst claim
      Thy right, and awe the robbers back, who press
    To shed thy blood, and drink the tears of thy distress;

                             XLIII.

    Then might'st thou more appal--or, less desired,
      Be homely and be peaceful, undeplored[mo]
      For thy destructive charms; then, still untired,
      Would not be seen the armed torrents poured
      Down the deep Alps; nor would the hostile horde
      Of many-nationed spoilers from the Po
      Quaff blood and water; nor the stranger's sword
      Be thy sad weapon of defence--and so,
    Victor or vanquished, thou the slave of friend or foe.

                             XLIV.

    Wandering in youth, I traced the path of him,
      The Roman friend of Rome's least-mortal mind,[422]
      The friend of Tully: as my bark did skim
      The bright blue waters with a fanning wind,
      Came Megara before me, and behind
      AEgina lay--Piraeus on the right,
      And Corinth on the left; I lay reclined
      Along the prow, and saw all these unite
    In ruin--even as he had seen the desolate sight;

                              XLV.

    For Time hath not rebuilt them, but upreared
      Barbaric dwellings on their shattered site,
      Which only make more mourned and more endeared
      The few last rays of their far-scattered light,
      And the crashed relics of their vanished might.
      The Roman saw these tombs in his own age,
      These sepulchres of cities, which excite[mp]
      Sad wonder, and his yet surviving page
    The moral lesson bears, drawn from such pilgrimage.

                             XLVI.

    That page is now before me, and on mine
      _His_ Country's ruin added to the mass
      Of perished states he mourned in their decline,
      And I in desolation: all that _was_
      Of then destruction _is_; and now, alas!
      Rome--Rome imperial, bows her to the storm,[423]
      In the same dust and blackness, and we pass
      The skeleton of her Titanic form,[424]
    Wrecks of another world, whose ashes still are warm.

                             XLVII.

    Yet, Italy! through every other land
      Thy wrongs should ring--and shall--from side to side;[425]
      Mother of Arts! as once of Arms! thy hand
      Was then our Guardian, and is still our Guide;
      Parent of our Religion! whom the wide
      Nations have knelt to for the keys of Heaven!
      Europe, repentant of her parricide,
      Shall yet redeem thee, and, all backward driven,
    Roll the barbarian tide, and sue to be forgiven.

                            XLVIII.

    But Arno wins us to the fair white walls,
      Where the Etrurian Athens claims and keeps
      A softer feeling for her fairy halls:
      Girt by her theatre of hills, she reaps
      Her corn, and wine, and oil--and Plenty leaps
      To laughing life, with her redundant Horn.
      Along the banks where smiling Arno sweeps
      Was modern Luxury of Commerce born,[mq][426]
    And buried Learning rose, redeemed to a new Morn.

                             XLIX.

    There, too, the Goddess loves in stone, and fills[mr][427][14.H.]
      The air around with Beauty--we inhale[ms]
      The ambrosial aspect, which, beheld, instils
      Part of its immortality--the veil
      Of heaven is half undrawn--within the pale
      We stand, and in that form and face behold
      What Mind can make, when Nature's self would fail;
      And to the fond Idolaters of old
    Envy the innate flash which such a Soul could mould:

                               L.

    We gaze and turn away, and know not where,
      Dazzled and drunk with Beauty,[428] till the heart
      Reels with its fulness; there--for ever there--
      Chained to the chariot of triumphal Art,
      We stand as captives, and would not depart.
      Away!--there need no words, nor terms precise,
      The paltry jargon of the marble mart,
      Where Pedantry gulls Folly--we have eyes:
    Blood--pulse--and breast confirm the Dardan Shepherd's prize.

                              LI.

    Appear'dst thou not to Paris in this guise?
      Or to more deeply blest Anchises? or,
      In all thy perfect Goddess-ship, when lies
      Before thee thy own vanquished Lord of War?
      And gazing in thy face as toward a star,
      Laid on thy lap, his eyes to thee upturn,
      Feeding on thy sweet cheek![429] while thy lips are
      With lava kisses melting while they burn,
    Showered on his eyelids, brow, and mouth, as from an urn!

                              LII.

    Glowing, and circumfused in speechless love--[mt][430]
      Their full divinity inadequate
      That feeling to express, or to improve--
      The Gods become as mortals--and man's fate[mu]
      Has moments like their brightest; but the weight
      Of earth recoils upon us;--let it go!
      We can recall such visions, and create,
      From what has been, or might be, things which grow
    Into thy statue's form, and look like gods below.

                             LIII.

    I leave to learned fingers, and wise hands,
      The Artist and his Ape, to teach and tell
      How well his Connoisseurship understands
      The graceful bend, and the voluptuous swell:
      Let these describe the undescribable:
      I would not their vile breath should crisp the stream
      Wherein that Image shall for ever dwell--
      The unruffled mirror of the loveliest dream
    That ever left the sky on the deep soul to beam.

                              LIV.

    In Santa Croce's[431] holy precincts lie[15.H.]
      Ashes which make it holier, dust which is
      Even in itself an immortality,
      Though there were nothing save the past, and this,
      The particle of those sublimities
      Which have relapsed to chaos:--here repose
      Angelo's--Alfieri's[432] bones--and his,[16.H.]
      The starry Galileo, with his woes;
    Here Machiavelli's earth returned to whence it rose.[17.H.]

                              LV.

    These are four minds, which, like the elements,
      Might furnish forth creation:--Italy![mv]
      Time, which hath wronged thee with ten thousand rents
      Of thine imperial garment, shall deny[mw]
      And hath denied, to every other sky,
      Spirits which soar from ruin:--thy Decay
      Is still impregnate with divinity,
      Which gilds it with revivifying ray;
    Such as the great of yore, Canova[433] is to-day.

                              LVI.

    But where repose the all Etruscan three--
      Dante, and Petrarch, and, scarce less than they,
      The Bard of Prose, creative Spirit! he[mx]
      Of the Hundred Tales of Love--where did they lay
      Their bones, distinguished from our common clay
      In death as life? Are they resolved to dust,
      And have their Country's Marbles nought to say?
      Could not her quarries furnish forth one bust?
    Did they not to her breast their filial earth entrust?

                             LVII.

    Ungrateful Florence! Dante sleeps afar,[434][18.H.]
      Like Scipio buried by the upbraiding shore:[435][19.H.]
      Thy factions, in their worse than civil war,[436]
      Proscribed the Bard whose name for evermore
      Their children's children would in vain adore
      With the remorse of ages; and the crown[437][20.H.]
      Which Petrarch's laureate brow supremely wore,
      Upon a far and foreign soil had grown,
    His Life, his Fame, his Grave, though rifled--not thine own.[438]

                             LVIII.

    Boccaccio[439] to his parent earth bequeathed[my][21.H.]
      His dust,--and lies it not her Great among,
      With many a sweet and solemn requiem breathed
      O'er him who formed the Tuscan's siren tongue?[440]
      That music in itself, whose sounds are song,
      The poetry of speech? No;--even his tomb
      Uptorn, must bear the hyaena bigot's wrong,
      No more amidst the meaner dead find room,
    Nor claim a passing sigh, because it told for _whom!_

                              LIX.

    And Santa Croce wants their mighty dust;
      Yet for this want more noted, as of yore
      The Caesar's pageant,[441] shorn of Brutus' bust,
      Did but of Rome's best Son remind her more:
      Happier Ravenna! on thy hoary shore,
      Fortress of falling Empire! honoured sleeps[mz]
      The immortal Exile;--Arqua, too, her store
      Of tuneful relics proudly claims and keeps,
    While Florence vainly begs her banished dead and weeps.[442]

                              LX.

    What is her Pyramid of precious stones?[22.H.]
      Of porphyry, jasper, agate, and all hues
      Of gem and marble, to encrust the bones
      Of merchant-dukes?[443] the momentary dews
      Which, sparkling to the twilight stars, infuse
      Freshness in the green turf that wraps the dead,
      Whose names are Mausoleums of the Muse,
      Are gently prest with far more reverent tread
    Than ever paced the slab which paves the princely head.

                              LXI.

    There be more things to greet the heart and eyes
      In Arno's dome of Art's most princely shrine,
      Where Sculpture with her rainbow Sister vies;[444]
      There be more marvels yet--but not for mine;
      For I have been accustomed to entwine
      My thoughts with Nature rather in the fields,
      Than Art in galleries: though a work divine
      Calls for my Spirit's homage, yet it yields
    Less than it feels, because the weapon which it wields

                             LXII.

    Is of another temper, and I roam
      By Thrasimene's lake,[445] in the defiles
      Fatal to Roman rashness, more at home;
      For there the Carthaginian's warlike wiles
      Come back before me, as his skill beguiles
      The host between the mountains and the shore,
      Where Courage falls in her despairing files,[na]
      And torrents, swoll'n to rivers with their gore,
    Reek through the sultry plain, with legions scattered o'er.

                             LXIII.

    Like to a forest felled by mountain winds;
      And such the storm of battle on this day,
      And such the frenzy, whose convulsion blinds
      To all save Carnage, that, beneath the fray,
      An Earthquake[446] reeled unheededly away![23.H.]
      None felt stern Nature rocking at his feet,
      And yawning forth a grave for those who lay
      Upon their bucklers for a winding sheet--
    Such is the absorbing hate when warring nations meet!

                             LXIV.

    The Earth to them was as a rolling bark
      Which bore them to Eternity--they saw
      The Ocean round, but had no time to mark
      The motions of their vessel; Nature's law,
      In them suspended, recked not of the awe
      Which reigns when mountains tremble, and the birds
      Plunge in the clouds for refuge, and withdraw[nb]
      From their down-toppling nests; and bellowing herds
    Stumble o'er heaving plains--and Man's dread hath no words.

                              LXV.

    Far other scene is Thrasimene now;
      Her lake a sheet of silver, and her plain
      Rent by no ravage save the gentle plough;
      Her aged trees rise thick as once the slain
      Lay where their roots are; but a brook hath ta'en--
      A little rill of scanty stream and bed--
      A name of blood from that day's sanguine rain;
      And Sanguinetto tells ye where the dead
    Made the earth wet, and turned the unwilling waters red.[nc]

                             LXVI.

    But thou, Clitumnus[447]! in thy sweetest wave
      Of the most living crystal that was e'er
      The haunt of river-Nymph, to gaze and lave
      Her limbs where nothing hid them, thou dost rear
      Thy grassy banks whereon the milk-white steer[448]
      Grazes--the purest God of gentle waters!
      And most serene of aspect, and most clear;
      Surely that stream was unprofaned by slaughters--
    A mirror and a bath for Beauty's youngest daughters!

                             LXVII.

    And on thy happy shore a Temple[449] still,
      Of small and delicate proportion, keeps
      Upon a mild declivity of hill,[nd]
      Its memory of thee; beneath it sweeps
      Thy current's calmness; oft from out it leaps
      The finny darter with the glittering scales,[450]
      Who dwells and revels in thy glassy deeps;
      While, chance, some scattered water-lily sails[ne]
    Down where the shallower wave still tells its bubbling tales.

                            LXVIII.

    Pass not unblest the Genius of the place!
      If through the air a Zephyr more serene
      Win to the brow, 'tis his; and if ye trace
      Along his margin a more eloquent green,
      If on the heart the freshness of the scene
      Sprinkle its coolness, and from the dry dust
      Of weary life a moment lave it clean
      With Nature's baptism,--'tis to him ye must
    Pay orisons for this suspension of disgust.[451]

                             LXIX.

    The roar of waters!--from the headlong height
      Velino cleaves the wave-worn precipice;
      The fall of waters! rapid as the light
      The flashing mass foams shaking the abyss;
      The Hell of Waters! where they howl and hiss,
      And boil in endless torture; while the sweat
      Of their great agony, wrung out from this
      Their Phlegethon, curls round the rocks of jet
    That gird the gulf around, in pitiless horror set,

                              LXX.

    And mounts in spray the skies, and thence again
      Returns in an unceasing shower, which round,
      With its unemptied cloud of gentle rain,
      Is an eternal April to the ground,
      Making it all one emerald:--how profound[nf]
      The gulf! and how the Giant Element
      From rock to rock leaps with delirious bound,[ng]
      Crushing the cliffs, which, downward worn and rent
    With his fierce footsteps, yield in chasms a fearful vent

                             LXXI.

    To the broad column which rolls on, and shows
      More like the fountain of an infant sea
      Torn from the womb of mountains by the throes
      Of a new world, than only thus to be
      Parent of rivers, which flow gushingly,
      With many windings, through the vale:--Look back!
      Lo! where it comes like an Eternity,
      As if to sweep down all things in its track,
    Charming the eye with dread,--a matchless cataract,[452]

                             LXXII.

    Horribly beautiful! but on the verge,
      From side to side, beneath the glittering morn,
      An Iris[453] sits, amidst the infernal surge,
      Like Hope upon a death-bed, and, unworn
      Its steady dyes, while all around is torn
      By the distracted waters, bears serene
      Its brilliant hues with all their beams unshorn:
      Resembling, 'mid the torture of the scene,
    Love watching Madness with unalterable mien.

                            LXXIII.

    Once more upon the woody Apennine--
      The infant Alps, which--had I not before
      Gazed on their mightier Parents, where the pine
      Sits on more shaggy summits, and where roar[nh]
      The thundering Lauwine[454]--might be worshipped more;
      But I have seen the soaring Jungfrau rear[ni]
      Her never-trodden snow, and seen the hoar
      Glaciers of bleak Mont Blanc both far and near--
    And in Chimari heard the Thunder-Hills of fear,

                             LXXIV.

    Th' Acroceraunian mountains of old name;
      And on Parnassus seen the Eagles fly
      Like Spirits of the spot, as 'twere for fame.
      For still they soared unutterably high:
      I've looked on Ida with a Trojan's eye;
      Athos--Olympus--AEtna.--Atlas--made
      These hills seem things of lesser dignity;
      All, save the lone Soracte's height, displayed
    Not _now_ in snow, which asks the lyric Roman's aid

                             LXXV.

    For our remembrance, and from out the plain
      Heaves like a long-swept wave about to break,
      And on the curl hangs pausing: not in vain
      May he, who will, his recollections rake,
      And quote in classic raptures, and awake
      The hills with Latian echoes--I abhorred
      Too much, to conquer for the Poet's sake,[455]
      The drilled dull lesson, forced down word by word
    In my repugnant youth,[456] with pleasure to record

                             LXXVI.

    Aught that recalls the daily drug which turned
      My sickening memory; and, though Time hath taught
      My mind to meditate what then it learned,[nj]
      Yet such the fixed inveteracy wrought[nk]
      By the impatience of my early thought,
      That, with the freshness wearing out before
      My mind could relish what it might have sought,
      If free to choose, I cannot now restore
    Its health--but what it then detested, still abhor.[nl]

                            LXXVII.

    Then farewell, Horace--whom I hated so,
      Not for thy faults, but mine: it is a curse
      To understand, not feel thy lyric flow,
      To comprehend, but never love thy verse;
      Although no deeper Moralist rehearse
      Our little life, nor Bard prescribe his art,
      Nor livelier Satirist the conscience pierce,
      Awakening without wounding the touched heart,
    Yet fare thee well--upon Soracte's ridge we part.

                            LXXVIII.

    Oh, Rome! my Country! City of the Soul!
      The orphans of the heart must turn to thee,
      Lone Mother of dead Empires! and control
      In their shut breasts their petty misery.
      What are our woes and sufferance? Come and see
      The cypress--hear the owl--and plod your way
      O'er steps of broken thrones and temples--Ye!
      Whose agonies are evils of a day--
    A world is at our feet as fragile as our clay.

                             LXXIX.

    The Niobe of nations! there she stands,
      Childless and crownless, in her voiceless woe;[nm]
      empty urn within her withered hands,
      Whose holy dust was scattered long ago;
      The Scipios' tomb contains no ashes now;[457]
      The very sepulchres lie tenantless[458]
      Of their heroic dwellers: dost thou flow,
      Old Tiber! through a marble wilderness?
    Rise, with thy yellow waves, and mantle her distress.[459]

                             LXXX.

    The Goth, the Christian--Time--War--Flood, and Fire,[460]
      Have dealt upon the seven-hilled City's pride;
      She saw her glories star by star expire,[nn]
      And up the steep barbarian Monarchs ride,
      Where the car climbed the Capitol;[461] far and wide
      Temple and tower went down, nor left a site:
      Chaos of ruins! who shall trace the void,
      O'er the dim fragments cast a lunar light,
    And say, "here was, or is," where all is doubly night?

                             LXXXI.

    The double night of ages, and of her,[no]
      Night's daughter, Ignorance,[462] hath wrapt and wrap
      All round us; we but feel our way to err:
      The Ocean hath his chart, the Stars their map,
      And Knowledge spreads them on her ample lap;
      But Rome is as the desert--where we steer
      Stumbling o'er recollections; now we clap
      Our hands, and cry "Eureka!" "it is clear"--
    When but some false Mirage of ruin rises near.

                            LXXXII.

    Alas! the lofty city! and alas!
      The trebly hundred triumphs![463] and the day
      When Brutus made the dagger's edge surpass
      The Conqueror's sword in bearing fame away!
      Alas, for Tully's voice, and Virgil's lay,[np]
      And Livy's pictured page!--but these shall be
      Her resurrection; all beside--decay.
      Alas, for Earth, for never shall we see
    That brightness in her eye she bore when Rome was free!

                            LXXXIII.

    Oh, thou, whose chariot rolled on Fortune's wheel,
      Triumphant Sylla![464] Thou, who didst subdue
      Thy country's foes ere thou wouldst pause to feel
      The wrath of thy own wrongs, or reap the due
      Of hoarded vengeance till thine Eagles flew
      O'er prostrate Asia;--thou, who with thy frown
      Annihilated senates;--Roman, too,
      With all thy vices--for thou didst lay down
    With an atoning smile a more than earthly crown,

                            LXXXIV.

    Thy dictatorial wreath--couldst thou divine
      To what would one day dwindle that which made
      Thee more than mortal? and that so supine
      By aught than Romans Rome should thus be laid?[nq]
      She who was named Eternal, and arrayed
      Her warriors but to conquer--she who veiled
      Earth with her haughty shadow, and displayed,[nr]
      Until the o'er-canopied horizon failed,
    Her rushing wings--Oh! she who was Almighty hailed!

                             LXXXV.

    Sylla was first of victors; but our own,[ns]
      The sagest of usurpers, Cromwell!--he
      Too swept off senates while he hewed the throne
      Down to a block--immortal rebel! See
      What crimes it costs to be a moment free,
      And famous through all ages! but beneath
      His fate the moral lurks of destiny;
      His day of double victory and death
    Beheld him win two realms, and, happier, yield his breath.[465]

                            LXXXVI.

    The third of the same Moon whose former course
      Had all but crowned him, on the selfsame day
      Deposed him gently from his throne of force,
      And laid him with the Earth's preceding clay.
      And showed not Fortune thus how fame and sway,
      And all we deem delightful, and consume
      Our souls to compass through each arduous way,
      Are in her eyes less happy than the tomb?
    Were they but so in Man's, how different were his doom!

                            LXXXVII.

    And thou, dread Statue![466] yet existent in[24.H.]
      The austerest form of naked majesty--
      Thou who beheldest, 'mid the assassins' din,
      At thy bathed base the bloody Caesar lie,
      Folding his robe in dying dignity--
      An offering to thine altar from the Queen
      Of gods and men, great Nemesis! did he die,
      And thou, too, perish, Pompey? have ye been
    Victors of countless kings, or puppets of a scene?

                           LXXXVIII.

    And thou, the thunder-stricken nurse of Rome![467][25.H.]
      She-wolf! whose brazen-imaged dugs impart
      The milk of conquest yet within the dome
      Where, as a monument of antique art,
      Thou standest:--Mother of the mighty heart,
      Which the great Founder sucked from thy wild teat,
      Scorched by the Roman Jove's ethereal dart,
      And thy limbs black with lightning--dost thou yet
    Guard thine immortal cubs, nor thy fond charge forget?

                            LXXXIX.

    Thou dost;--but all thy foster-babes are dead--
      The men of iron; and the World hath reared
      Cities from out their sepulchres: men bled
      In imitation of the things[468] they feared,
      And fought and conquered, and the same course steered,
      At apish distance; but as yet none have,
      Nor could, the same supremacy have neared,
      Save one vain Man, who is not in the grave--
    But, vanquished by himself, to his own slaves a slave--[469]

                              XC.

    The fool of false dominion--and a kind
      Of bastard Caesar, following him of old
      With steps unequal; for the Roman's mind
      Was modelled in a less terrestrial mould,[26.H.]
      With passions fiercer, yet a judgment cold,[470]
      And an immortal instinct which redeemed
      The frailties of a heart so soft, yet bold--
      Alcides with the distaff now he seemed
    At Cleopatra's feet,--and now himself he beamed,

                              XCI.

    And came--and saw--and conquered![471] But the man
      Who would have tamed his Eagles down to flee,
      Like a trained falcon, in the Gallic van,[472]
      Which he, in sooth, long led to Victory,
      With a deaf heart which never seemed to be
      A listener to itself, was strangely framed;
      With but one weakest weakness--Vanity--[nt]
      Coquettish in ambition--still he aimed--
    And what? can he avouch, or answer what he claimed?[nu]

                             XCII.

    And would be all or nothing--nor could wait
      For the sure grave to level him; few years
      Had fixed him with the Caesars in his fate
      On whom we tread: For _this_ the conqueror rears
      The Arch of Triumph! and for this the tears
      And blood of earth flow on as they have flowed,
      An universal Deluge, which appears
      Without an Ark for wretched Man's abode,
    And ebbs but to reflow!--Renew thy rainbow, God![nv]

                             XCIII.

    What from this barren being do we reap?[473]
      Our senses narrow, and our reason frail,
      Life short, and truth a gem which loves the deep,
      And all things weighed in Custom's falsest scale;[474]
      Opinion an Omnipotence,--whose veil
      Mantles the earth with darkness, until right
      And wrong are accidents, and Men grow pale
      Lest their own judgments should become too bright,
    And their free thoughts be crimes, and Earth have too much light.

                             XCIV.

    And thus they plod in sluggish misery,[nw]
      Rotting from sire to son, and age to age,[475]
      Proud of their trampled nature, and so die,[nx]
      Bequeathing their hereditary rage
      To the new race of inborn slaves, who wage
      War for their chains, and rather than be free,
      Bleed gladiator-like, and still engage
      Within the same Arena where they see
    Their fellows fall before, like leaves of the same tree.

                              XCV.

    I speak not of men's creeds--they rest between
      Man and his Maker--but of things allowed,
      Averred, and known, and daily, hourly seen--
      The yoke that is upon us doubly bowed,
      And the intent of Tyranny avowed,
      The edict of Earth's rulers, who are grown
      The apes of him who humbled once the proud,
      And shook them from their slumbers on the throne;
    Too glorious, were this all his mighty arm had done.

                             XCVI.

    Can tyrants but by tyrants conquered be,
      And Freedom find no Champion and no Child[476]
      Such as Columbia saw arise when she
      Sprung forth a Pallas, armed and undefined?
      Or must such minds be nourished in the wild,
      Deep in the unpruned forest, 'midst the roar[ny]
      Of cataracts, where nursing Nature smiled
      On infant Washington? Has Earth no more
    Such seeds within her breast, or Europe no such shore?

                             XCVII.

    But France got drunk with blood to vomit crime;[nz]
      And fatal have her Saturnalia been[oa]
      To Freedom's cause, in every age and clime;
      Because the deadly days which we have seen,
      And vile Ambition, that built up between
      Man and his hopes an adamantine wall,
      And the base pageant[477] last upon the scene,
      Are grown the pretext for the eternal thrall
    Which nips Life's tree, and dooms Man's worst--his second fall.[478]

                            XCVIII.

    Yet, Freedom! yet thy banner, torn, but flying,
      Streams like the thunder-storm _against_ the wind;[479]
      Thy trumpet voice, though broken now and dying,
      The loudest still the Tempest leaves behind;
      Thy tree hath lost its blossoms, and the rind,
      Chopped by the axe, looks rough and little worth,
      But the sap lasts,--and still the seed we find
      Sown deep, even in the bosom of the North;
    So shall a better spring less bitter fruit bring forth.

                             XCIX.

    There is a stern round tower of other days[480]
      Firm as a fortress, with its fence of stone,
      Such as an army's baffled strength delays,
      Standing with half its battlements alone,
      And with two thousand years of ivy grown,
      The garland of Eternity, where wave
      The green leaves over all by Time o'erthrown;--
      What was this tower of strength? within its cave
    What treasure lay so locked, so hid?--A woman's grave.[ob]

                               C.

    But who was she, the Lady of the dead,
      Tombed in a palace? Was she chaste and fair?
      Worthy a king's--or more--a Roman's bed?
      What race of Chiefs and Heroes did she bear?
      What daughter of her beauties was the heir?
      How lived--how loved--how died she? Was she not
      So honoured--and conspicuously there,
      Where meaner relics must not dare to rot,
    Placed to commemorate a more than mortal lot?

                              CI.

    Was she as those who love their lords, or they
      Who love the lords of others? such have been
      Even in the olden time, Rome's annals say.
      Was she a matron of Cornelia's mien,
      Or the light air of Egypt's graceful Queen,
      Profuse of joy--or 'gainst it did she war,
      Inveterate in virtue? Did she lean
      To the soft side of the heart, or wisely bar
    Love from amongst her griefs?--for such the affections are.[oc]

                              CII.

    Perchance she died in youth--it may be, bowed
      With woes far heavier than the ponderous tomb
      That weighed upon her gentle dust: a cloud
      Might gather o'er her beauty, and a gloom
      In her dark eye, prophetic of the doom
      Heaven gives its favourites[481]--early death--yet shed
      A sunset charm around her, and illume
      With hectic light, the Hesperus of the dead,
    Of her consuming cheek the autumnal leaf-like red.

                             CIII.

    Perchance she died in age--surviving all,
      Charms--kindred--children--with the silver gray
      On her long tresses, which might yet recall,
      It may be, still a something of the day
      When they were braided, and her proud array
      And lovely form were envied, praised, and eyed
      By Rome--But whither would Conjecture stray?[482]
      Thus much alone we know--Metella died,
    The wealthiest Roman's wife: Behold his love or pride!

                              CIV.

    I know not why--but standing thus by thee
      It seems as if I had thine inmate known,
      Thou Tomb! and other days come back on me
      With recollected music, though the tone
      Is changed and solemn, like the cloudy groan
      Of dying thunder on the distant wind;
      Yet could I seat me by this ivied stone
      Till I had bodied forth the heated mind[od]
    Forms from the floating wreck which Ruin leaves behind:

                              CV.

    And from the planks, far shattered o'er the rocks,
      Built me a little bark of hope, once more
      To battle with the Ocean and the shocks
      Of the loud breakers, and the ceaseless roar
      Which rushes on the solitary shore
      Where all lies foundered that was ever dear:
      But could I gather from the wave-worn store
      Enough for my rude boat, where should I steer?
    There woos no home, nor hope, nor life, save what is here.[oe]

                              CVI.

    Then let the Winds howl on! their harmony
      Shall henceforth be my music, and the Night
      The sound shall temper with the owlets' cry,
      As I now hear them, in the fading light
      Dim o'er the bird of darkness' native site,
      Answering each other on the Palatine,
      With their large eyes, all glistening gray and bright,
      And sailing pinions.--Upon such a shrine
    What are our petty griefs?--let me not number mine.

                             CVII.

    Cypress and ivy, weed and wallflower grown[483]
      Matted and massed together--hillocks heaped
      On what were chambers--arch crushed, column strown
      In fragments--choked up vaults, and frescos steeped
      In subterranean damps, where the owl peeped,[of]
      Deeming it midnight:--Temples--Baths--or Halls?
      Pronounce who can: for all that Learning reaped
      From her research hath been, that these are walls--
    Behold the Imperial Mount! 'tis thus the Mighty falls.[484]

                             CVIII.

    There is the moral of all human tales;[485]
      'Tis but the same rehearsal of the past,
      First Freedom, and then Glory--when that fails,
      Wealth--Vice--Corruption,--Barbarism at last.
      And History, with all her volumes vast,
      Hath but _one_ page,--'tis better written here,
      Where gorgeous Tyranny hath thus amassed
      All treasures, all delights, that Eye or Ear,
    Heart, Soul could seek--Tongue ask--Away with words! draw near,

                              CIX.

    Admire--exult--despise--laugh--weep,--for here
      There is such matter for all feeling:--Man![og]
      Thou pendulum betwixt a smile and tear,
      Ages and Realms are crowded in this span,
      This mountain, whose obliterated plan
      The pyramid of Empires pinnacled,
      Of Glory's gewgaws shining in the van[oh]
      Till the Sun's rays with added flame were filled!
    Where are its golden roofs?[486] where those who dared to build?

                              CX.

    Tully was not so eloquent as thou,
      Thou nameless column[487] with the buried base!
      What are the laurels of the Caesar's brow?
      Crown me with ivy from his dwelling-place.
      Whose arch or pillar meets me in the face,
      Titus or Trajan's? No--'tis that of Time:
      Triumph, arch, pillar, all he doth displace[oi]
      Scoffing; and apostolic statues[488] climb
    To crush the imperial urn, whose ashes slept sublime,

                              CXI.

    Buried in air, the deep blue sky of Rome,
      And looking to the stars: they had contained
      A Spirit which with these would find a home,
      The last of those who o'er the whole earth reigned,
      The Roman Globe--for, after, none sustained,
      But yielded back his conquests:--he was more
      Than a mere Alexander, and, unstained
      With household blood and wine, serenely wore
    His sovereign virtues--still we Trajan's[489] name adore.

                             CXII.

    Where is the rock of Triumph,[490] the high place
      Where Rome embraced her heroes?--where the steep
      Tarpeian?--fittest goal of Treason's race,
      The Promontory whence the Traitor's Leap[oj]
      Cured all ambition?[491] Did the conquerors heap
      Their spoils here? Yes; and in yon field below,
      A thousand years of silenced factions sleep--
      The Forum, where the immortal accents glow,
    And still the eloquent air breathes-burns with Cicero![ok][492]

                             CXIII.

    The field of Freedom--Faction--Fame--and Blood:
      Here a proud people's passions were exhaled,
      From the first hour of Empire in the bud
      To that when further worlds to conquer failed;
      But long before had Freedom's face been veiled,
      And Anarchy assumed her attributes;
      Till every lawless soldier who assailed
      Trod on the trembling Senate's slavish mutes,
    Or raised the venal voice of baser prostitutes.

                             CXIV.

    Then turn we to her latest Tribune's name,
      From her ten thousand tyrants turn to thee,
      Redeemer of dark centuries of shame--
      The friend of Petrarch--hope of Italy--
      Rienzi! last of Romans![493] While the tree
      Of Freedom's withered trunk puts forth a leaf,
      Even for thy tomb a garland let it be--
      The Forum's champion, and the people's chief--
    Her new-born Numa thou--with reign, alas! too brief.

                              CXV.

    Egeria! sweet creation of some heart[27.H.]
      Which found no mortal resting-place so fair
      As thine ideal breast; whate'er thou art
      Or wert,--a young Aurora of the air,
      The nympholepsy[494] of some fond despair--[ol]
      Or--it might be--a Beauty of the earth,
      Who found a more than common Votary there
      Too much adoring--whatsoe'er thy birth,
    Thou wert a beautiful Thought, and softly bodied forth.

                             CXVI.

    The mosses of thy Fountain[495] still are sprinkled
      With thine Elysian water-drops; the face
      Of thy cave-guarded Spring, with years unwrinkled,
      Reflects the meek-eyed Genius of the place,
      Whose green, wild margin now no more erase
      Art's works; nor must the delicate waters sleep
      Prisoned in marble--bubbling from the base
      Of the cleft statue, with a gentle leap
    The rill runs o'er--and round, fern, flowers, and ivy, creep

                             CXVII.

    Fantastically tangled: the green hills
      Are clothed with early blossoms--through the grass
      The quick-eyed lizard rustles--and the bills
      Of summer-birds sing welcome as ye pass;
      Flowers fresh in hue, and many in their class,
      Implore the pausing step, and with their dyes
      Dance in the soft breeze in a fairy mass;
      The sweetness of the Violet's deep blue eyes,
    Kissed by the breath of heaven, seems coloured by its skies.[496]

                            CXVIII.

    Here didst thou dwell, in this enchanted cover,[497]
      Egeria! thy all heavenly bosom beating
      For the far footsteps of thy mortal lover;
      The purple Midnight veiled that mystic meeting
      With her most starry canopy[498]--and seating
      Thyself by thine adorer, what befel?
      This cave was surely shaped out for the greeting
      Of an enamoured Goddess, and the cell
    Haunted by holy Love--the earliest Oracle!

                             CXIX.

    And didst thou not, thy breast to his replying,
      Blend a celestial with a human heart;[om]
      And Love, which dies as it was born, in sighing,
      Share with immortal transports? could thine art
      Make them indeed immortal, and impart
      The purity of Heaven to earthly joys,
      Expel the venom and not blunt the dart--
      The dull satiety which all destroys--
    And root from out the soul the deadly weed which cloys?

                              CXX.

    Alas! our young affections run to waste,
      Or water but the desert! whence arise
      But weeds of dark luxuriance, tares of haste,
      Rank at the core, though tempting to the eyes
      Flowers whose wild odours breathe but agonies,
      And trees whose gums are poison; such the plants
      Which spring beneath her steps as Passion flies
      O'er the World's wilderness, and vainly pants
    For some celestial fruit forbidden to our wants.

                             CXXI.

    Oh, Love! no habitant of earth thou art--[on]
      An unseen Seraph, we believe in thee,--
      A faith whose martyrs are the broken heart,--
      But never yet hath seen, nor e'er shall see
      The naked eye, thy form, as it should be;[499]
      The mind hath made thee, as it peopled Heaven,
      Even with its own desiring phantasy,
      And to a thought such shape and image given,
    As haunts the unquenched soul--parched--wearied--wrung--and riven.

                             CXXII.

    Of its own beauty is the mind diseased,
      And fevers into false creation:--where,
      Where are the forms the sculptor's soul hath seized?
      In him alone. Can Nature show so fair?
      Where are the charms and virtues which we dare
      Conceive in boyhood and pursue as men,
      The unreached Paradise of our despair,
      Which o'er-informs[500] the pencil and the pen,
    And overpowers the page where it would bloom again?

                            CXXIII.

    Who loves, raves[501]--'tis youth's frenzy--but the cure
      Is bitterer still, as charm by charm unwinds
      Which robed our idols, and we see too sure
      Nor Worth nor Beauty dwells from out the mind's
      Ideal shape of such; yet still it binds
      The fatal spell, and still it draws us on,
      Reaping the whirlwind from the oft-sown winds;
      The stubborn heart, its alchemy begun,
    Seems ever near the prize--wealthiest when most undone.

                             CXXIV.

    We wither from our youth, we gasp away--
      Sick--sick; unfound the boon--unslaked the thirst,
      Though to the last, in verge of our decay,
      Some phantom lures, such as we sought at first--
      But all too late,--so are we doubly curst.
      Love, Fame, Ambition, Avarice--'tis the same,
      Each idle--and all ill--and none the worst--
      For all are meteors with a different name,[oo]
    And Death the sable smoke where vanishes the flame.

                             CXXV.

    Few--none--find what they love or could have loved,
      Though accident, blind contact, and the strong
      Necessity of loving, have removed
      Antipathies--but to recur, ere long,
      Envenomed with irrevocable wrong;
      And Circumstance, that unspiritual God
      And Miscreator, makes and helps along
      Our coming evils with a crutch-like rod,[502]
    Whose touch turns Hope to dust,--the dust we all have trod.

                             CXXVI.

    Our life is a false nature--'tis not in
      The harmony of things,--this hard decree,
      This uneradicable taint of Sin,
      This boundless Upas, this all-blasting tree,
      Whose root is Earth--whose leaves and branches be
      The skies which rain their plagues on men like dew--
      Disease, death, bondage--all the woes we see,
      And worse, the woes we see not--which throb through
    The immedicable soul,[503] with heart-aches ever new.

                            CXXVII.

    Yet let us ponder boldly--'tis a base
      Abandonment of reason[504] to resign
      Our right of thought--our last and only place
      Of refuge; this, at least, shall still be mine:
      Though from our birth the Faculty divine
      Is chained and tortured--cabined, cribbed, confined,
      And bred in darkness,[505] lest the Truth should shine
      Too brightly on the unprepared mind,
    The beam pours in--for Time and Skill will couch the blind.

                            CXXVIII.

    Arches on arches![506] as it were that Rome,
      Collecting the chief trophies of her line,
      Would build up all her triumphs in one dome,
      Her Coliseum stands;[507] the moonbeams shine
      As 'twere its natural torches--for divine
      Should be the light which streams here,--to illume
      This long-explored but still exhaustless mine
      Of Contemplation; and the azure gloom
    Of an Italian night, where the deep skies assume

                             CXXIX.

    Hues which have words, and speak to ye of Heaven,
      Floats o'er this vast and wondrous monument,
      And shadows forth its glory. There is given
      Unto the things of earth, which Time hath bent,
      A Spirit's feeling, and where he hath leant
      His hand, but broke his scythe, there is a power
      And magic in the ruined battlement,
      For which the Palace of the present hour
    Must yield its pomp, and wait till Ages are its dower.

                             CXXX.

    Oh, Time! the Beautifier of the dead,
      Adorner of the ruin[508]--Comforter
      And only Healer when the heart hath bled;
      Time! the Corrector where our judgments err,
      The test of Truth, Love--sole philosopher,
      For all beside are sophists--from thy thrift,
      Which never loses though it doth defer--
      Time, the Avenger! unto thee I lift
    My hands, and eyes, and heart, and crave of thee a gift:

                             CXXXI.

    Amidst this wreck, where thou hast made a shrine
      And temple more divinely desolate--
      Among thy mightier offerings here are mine,
      Ruins of years--though few, yet full of fate:--
      If thou hast ever seen me too elate,
      Hear me not; but if calmly I have borne
      Good, and reserved my pride against the hate
      Which shall not whelm me, let me not have worn
    This iron in my soul in vain--shall _they_ not mourn?

                            CXXXII.

    And Thou, who never yet of human wrong
      Left the unbalanced scale, great Nemesis![509][28.H.]
      Here, where the ancient paid thee homage long--
      Thou, who didst call the Furies from the abyss,
      And round Orestes bade them howl and hiss
      For that unnatural retribution--just,
      Had it but been from hands less near--in this
      Thy former realm, I call thee from the dust!
    Dost thou not hear my heart?--Awake! thou shalt, and must.

                            CXXXIII.

    It is not that I may not have incurred,
      For my ancestral faults or mine, the wound[op]
      I bleed withal; and, had it been conferred
      With a just weapon, it had flowed unbound;
      But now my blood shall not sink in the ground--
      To thee I do devote it--_Thou_ shalt take
      The vengeance, which shall yet be sought and found--
      Which if _I_ have not taken for the sake--
    But let that pass--I sleep--but Thou shalt yet awake.

                            CXXXIV.

    And if my voice break forth, 'tis not that now[oq]
      I shrink from what is suffered: let him speak
      Who hath beheld decline upon my brow,
      Or seen my mind's convulsion leave it weak;
      But in this page a record will I seek.
      Not in the air shall these my words disperse,
      Though I be ashes; a far hour shall wreak
      The deep prophetic fulness of this verse,
    And pile on human heads the mountain of my curse!

                             CXXXV.

    That curse shall be Forgiveness.--Have I not--
      Hear me, my mother Earth! behold it, Heaven!--
      Have I not had to wrestle with my lot?
      Have I not suffered things to be forgiven?
      Have I not had my brain seared, my heart riven,
      Hopes sapped, name blighted, Life's life lied away?
      And only not to desperation driven,
      Because not altogether of such clay
    As rots into the souls of those whom I survey.

                          CXXXVI.[or]

    From mighty wrongs to petty perfidy
      Have I not seen what human things could do?
      From the loud roar of foaming calumny
      To the small whisper of the as paltry few--
      And subtler venom of the reptile crew,
      The Janus glance[510] of whose significant eye,
      Learning to lie with silence, would _seem_ true--
      And without utterance, save the shrug or sigh,
    Deal round to happy fools its speechless obloquy.

                            CXXXVII.

    But I have lived, and have not lived in vain:
      My mind may lose its force, my blood its fire,
      And my frame perish even in conquering pain;
      But there is that within me which shall tire
      Torture and Time, and breathe when I expire;
      Something unearthly, which they deem not of,
      Like the remembered tone of a mute lyre,
      Shall on their softened spirits sink, and move
    In hearts all rocky now the late remorse of Love.

                           CXXXVIII.

    The seal is set.--Now welcome, thou dread Power!
      Nameless, yet thus omnipotent, which here
      Walk'st in the shadow of the midnight hour
      With a deep awe, yet all distinct from fear;
      Thy haunts are ever where the dead walls rear
      Their ivy mantles, and the solemn scene
      Derives from thee a sense so deep and clear
      That we become a part of what has been,
    And grow upon the spot--all-seeing but unseen.

                            CXXXIX.

    And here the buzz of eager nations ran,
      In murmured pity, or loud-roared applause,
      As man was slaughtered by his fellow man.
      And wherefore slaughtered? wherefore, but because
      Such were the bloody Circus' genial laws,
      And the imperial pleasure.--Wherefore not?
      What matters where we fall to fill the maws
      Of worms--on battle-plains or listed spot?
    Both are but theatres--where the chief actors rot.

                              CXL.

    I see before me the Gladiator[511] lie:
      He leans upon his hand--his manly brow[os]
      Consents to death, but conquers agony,
      And his drooped head sinks gradually low--
      And through his side the last drops, ebbing slow
      From the red gash, fall heavy, one by one,[ot]
      Like the first of a thunder-shower; and now[ou]
      The arena swims around him--he is gone,[ov]
    Ere ceased the inhuman shout which hailed the wretch who won.

                             CXLI.

    He heard it, but he heeded not--his eyes
      Were with his heart--and that was far away;
      He recked not of the life he lost nor prize,
      But where his rude hut by the Danube lay--
      _There_ were his young barbarians all at play,
      _There_ was their Dacian mother--he, their sire,
      Butchered to make a Roman holiday--[ow][29.H.]
      All this rushed with his blood--Shall he expire
    And unavenged?--Arise! ye Goths, and glut your ire!

                             CXLII.

    But here, where Murder breathed her bloody steam;--
      And here, where buzzing nations choked the ways,
      And roared or murmured like a mountain stream
      Dashing or winding as its torrent strays;
      Here, where the Roman million's blame or praise
      Was Death or Life--the playthings of a crowd--[ox][30.H.]
      My voice sounds much--and fall the stars' faint rays[oy]
      On the arena void--seats crushed--walls bowed--
    And galleries, where my steps seem echoes strangely loud.

                            CXLIII.

    A Ruin--yet what Ruin! from its mass
      Walls--palaces--half-cities, have been reared;
      Yet oft the enormous skeleton ye pass,[oz]
      And marvel where the spoil could have appeared.
      Hath it indeed been plundered, or but cleared?
      Alas! developed, opens the decay,
      When the colossal fabric's form is neared:
      It will not bear the brightness of the day,
    Which streams too much on all--years--man--have reft away.

                             CXLIV.

    But when the rising moon begins to climb
      Its topmost arch, and gently pauses there--
      When the stars twinkle through the loops of Time,
      And the low night-breeze waves along the air
      The garland-forest, which the gray walls wear,[pa]
      Like laurels on the bald first Caesar's head--[512]
      When the light shines serene but doth not glare--
      Then in this magic circle raise the dead;--
    Heroes have trod this spot--'tis on their dust ye tread.[pb]

                             CXLV.

    "While stands the Coliseum, Rome shall stand:[513]
      When falls the Coliseum, Rome shall fall;
      And when Rome falls--the World." From our own land
      Thus spake the pilgrims o'er this mighty wall
      In Saxon times, which we are wont to call
      Ancient; and these three mortal things are still
      On their foundations, and unaltered all--
      Rome and her Ruin past Redemption's skill--
    The World--the same wide den--of thieves, or what ye will.

                             CXLVI.

    Simple, erect, severe, austere, sublime--[514]
      Shrine of all saints and temple of all Gods,
      From Jove to Jesus--spared and blest by Time--
      Looking tranquillity, while falls or nods
      Arch--empire--each thing round thee--and Man plods
      His way through thorns to ashes--glorious Dome!
      Shalt thou not last? Time's scythe and Tyrants' rods
      Shiver upon thee--sanctuary and home
    Of Art and Piety--Pantheon!--pride of Rome![pc]

                            CXLVII.

    Relic of nobler days, and noblest arts!
      Despoiled yet perfect! with thy circle spreads
      A holiness appealing to all hearts;
      To Art a model--and to him who treads
      Rome for the sake of ages, Glory sheds
      Her light through thy sole aperture; to those
      Who worship, here are altars for their beads--
      And they who feel for Genius may repose
    Their eyes on honoured forms, whose busts around them close.[515]

                            CXLVIII.

    There is a dungeon, in whose dim drear light[516]
      What do I gaze on? Nothing--Look again!
      Two forms are slowly shadowed on my sight--
      Two insulated phantoms of the brain:[pd]
      It is not so--I see them full and plain--
      An old man, and a female young and fair,
      Fresh as a nursing mother, in whose vein
      The blood is nectar:--but what doth she there,
    With her unmantled neck, and bosom white and bare?[pe]

                             CXLIX.

    Full swells the deep pure fountain of young life,
      Where _on_ the heart and _from_ the heart we took
      Our first and sweetest nurture--when the wife,
      Blest into mother, in the innocent look,
      Or even the piping cry of lips that brook[pf]
      No pain and small suspense, a joy perceives[pg]
      Man knows not--when from out its cradled nook
      She sees her little bud put forth its leaves--
    What may the fruit be yet?--I know not--Cain was Eve's.

                              CL.

    But here Youth offers to Old Age the food,
      The milk of his own gift: it is her Sire
      To whom she renders back the debt of blood
      Born with her birth:--No--he shall not expire
      While in those warm and lovely veins the fire
      Of health and holy feeling can provide
      Great Nature's Nile, whose deep stream rises higher
      Than Egypt's river:--from that gentle side
    Drink--drink, and live--Old Man! Heaven's realm holds no such tide.

    The starry fable of the Milky Way[517]
      Has not thy story's purity; it is
      A constellation of a sweeter ray,
      And sacred Nature triumphs more in this
      Reverse of her decree, than in the abyss
      Where sparkle distant worlds:--Oh, holiest Nurse!
      No drop of that clear stream its way shall miss
      To thy Sire's heart, replenishing its source[ph]
    With life, as our freed souls rejoin the Universe.

    Turn to the Mole[518] which Hadrian reared on high,
      Imperial mimic of old Egypt's piles,
      Colossal copyist of deformity--
      Whose travelled phantasy from the far Nile's
      Enormous model, doomed the artist's toils
      To build for Giants, and for his vain earth,
      His shrunken ashes, raise this Dome: How smiles
      The gazer's eye with philosophic mirth,[pi]
    To view the huge design which sprung from such a birth!

                          CLIII.[519]

    But lo! the Dome--the vast and wondrous Dome,[pj][520]
      To which Diana's marvel was a cell--
      Christ's mighty shrine above His martyr's tomb![pk]
      I have beheld the Ephesian's miracle--[521]
      Its columns strew the wilderness, and dwell
      The hyaena and the jackal in their shade;[522]
      I have beheld Sophia's bright roofs swell[pl]
      Their glittering mass i' the Sun, and have surveyed[pm]
    Its sanctuary the while the usurping Moslem prayed;[523]

                             CLIV.

    But thou, of temples old, or altars new,
      Standest alone--with nothing like to thee--
      Worthiest of God, the Holy and the True!
      Since Zion's desolation, when that He
      Forsook his former city, what could be,
      Of earthly structures, in His honour piled,
      Of a sublimer aspect? Majesty--
      Power--Glory--Strength--and Beauty all are aisled
    In this eternal Ark of worship undefiled.

                              CLV.

    Enter: its grandeur overwhelms thee not;
      And why? it is not lessened--but thy mind,
      Expanded by the Genius of the spot,
      Has grown colossal, and can only find
      A fit[524] abode wherein appear enshrined
      Thy hopes of Immortality--and thou
      Shalt one day, if found worthy, so defined
      See thy God face to face, as thou dost now
    His Holy of Holies--nor be blasted by his brow.[pn]

    Thou movest--but increasing with the advance,[525]
      Like climbing some great Alp, which still doth rise,
      Deceived by its gigantic elegance--
      Vastness which grows, but grows to harmonize--[po]
      All musical in its immensities;
      Rich marbles, richer painting--shrines where flame[pp]
      The lamps of gold--and haughty dome which vies
      In air with Earth's chief structures, though their frame
    Sits on the firm-set ground--and this the clouds must claim.

                             CLVII.

    Thou seest not all--but piecemeal thou must break,
      To separate contemplation, the great whole;
      And as the Ocean many bays will make
      That ask the eye--so here condense thy soul
      To more immediate objects, and control
      Thy thoughts until thy mind hath got by heart
      Its eloquent proportions, and unroll[pq]
      In mighty graduations, part by part,
    The Glory which at once upon thee did not dart,

                            CLVIII.

    Not by its fault--but thine: Our outward sense[pr]
      Is but of gradual grasp--and as it is
      That what we have of feeling most intense
      Outstrips our faint expression; even so this
      Outshining and o'erwhelming edifice
      Fools our fond gaze, and greatest of the great
      Defies at first our Nature's littleness,
      Till, growing with its growth, we thus dilate
    Our Spirits to the size of that they contemplate.

                             CLIX.

    Then pause, and be enlightened; there is more
      In such a survey than the sating gaze
      Of wonder pleased, or awe which would adore
      The worship of the place, or the mere praise
      Of Art and its great Masters, who could raise
      What former time, nor skill, nor thought could plan:[ps]
      The fountain of Sublimity displays
      Its depth, and thence may draw the mind of Man[pt]
    Its golden sands, and learn what great Conceptions can.[pu]

    Or, turning to the Vatican, go see
      Laocoon's[526] torture dignifying pain--
      A Father's love and Mortal's agony
      With an Immortal's patience blending:--Vain
      The struggle--vain, against the coiling strain
      And gripe, and deepening of the dragon's grasp,
      The Old Man's clench; the long envenomed chain[pv]
      Rivets the living links,--the enormous Asp
    Enforces pang on pang, and stifles gasp on gasp.[pw]

    Or view the Lord of the unerring bow,[527]
      The God of Life, and Poesy, and Light--
      The Sun in human limbs arrayed, and brow
      All radiant from his triumph in the fight;
      The shaft hath just been shot--the arrow bright
      With an Immortal's vengeance--in his eye
      And nostril beautiful Disdain, and Might
      And Majesty, flash their full lightnings by,
    Developing in that one glance the Deity.

                             CLXII.

    But in his delicate form--a dream of Love,[528]
      Shaped by some solitary Nymph, whose breast
      Longed for a deathless lover from above,
      And maddened in that vision[529]--are exprest
      All that ideal Beauty ever blessed
      The mind with in its most unearthly mood,
      When each Conception was a heavenly Guest--
      A ray of Immortality--and stood,
    Starlike, around, until they gathered to a God![px]

                            CLXIII.

    And if it be Prometheus stole from Heaven
      The fire which we endure[530]--it was repaid
      By him to whom the energy was given
      Which this poetic marble hath arrayed
      With an eternal Glory--which, if made
      By human hands, is not of human thought--
      And Time himself hath hallowed it, nor laid
      One ringlet in the dust--nor hath it caught
    A tinge of years, but breathes the flame with which 'twas wrought.

                             CLXIV.

    But where is he, the Pilgrim of my Song,
      The Being who upheld it through the past?
      Methinks he cometh late and tarries long.
      He is no more--these breathings are his last--
      His wanderings done--his visions ebbing fast,
      And he himself as nothing:--if he was
      Aught but a phantasy, and could be classed
      With forms which live and suffer--let that pass--
    His shadow fades away into Destruction's mass,[py]

                             CLXV.

    Which gathers shadow--substance--life, and all
      That we inherit in its mortal shroud--
      And spreads the dim and universal pall
      Through which all things grow phantoms; and the cloud
      Between us sinks and all which ever glowed,
      Till Glory's self is twilight, and displays
      A melancholy halo scarce allowed
      To hover on the verge of darkness--rays
    Sadder than saddest night, for they distract the gaze,

                             CLXVI.

    And send us prying into the abyss,
      To gather what we shall be when the frame
      Shall be resolved to something less than this--
      Its wretched essence; and to dream of fame,
      And wipe the dust from off the idle name
      We never more shall hear,--but never more,
      Oh, happier thought! can we be made the same:--
      It is enough in sooth that _once_ we bore
    These fardels[531] of the heart--the heart whose sweat was gore.

                            CLXVII.

    Hark! forth from the abyss a voice proceeds,[532]
      A long low distant murmur of dread sound,
      Such as arises when a nation bleeds
      With some deep and immedicable wound;--
      Through storm and darkness yawns the rending ground--
      The gulf is thick with phantoms, but the Chief
      Seems royal still, though with her head discrowned,
      And pale, but lovely, with maternal grief--
    She clasps a babe, to whom her breast yields no relief.

                            CLXVIII.

    Scion of Chiefs and Monarchs, where art thou?
      Fond Hope of many nations, art thou dead?
      Could not the Grave forget thee, and lay low
      Some less majestic, less beloved head?
      In the sad midnight, while thy heart still bled,
      The mother of a moment, o'er thy boy,
      Death hushed that pang for ever: with thee fled
      The present happiness and promised joy
    Which filled the Imperial Isles so full it seemed to cloy.

                             CLXIX.

    Peasants bring forth in safety.--Can it be,
      Oh thou that wert so happy, so adored!
      Those who weep not for Kings shall weep for thee,
      And Freedom's heart, grown heavy, cease to hoard
      Her many griefs for _One_; for she had poured
      Her orisons for thee, and o'er thy head[pz]
      Beheld her Iris.--Thou, too, lonely Lord,
      And desolate Consort--vainly wert thou wed!
    The husband of a year! the father of the dead!

                             CLXX.

    Of sackcloth was thy wedding garment made;
      Thy bridal's fruit is ashes[533]: in the dust
      The fair-haired Daughter of the Isles is laid,
      The love of millions! How we did entrust
      Futurity to her! and, though it must
      Darken above our bones, yet fondly deemed
      Our children should obey her child, and blessed
      Her and her hoped-for seed, whose promise seemed
    Like stars to shepherd's eyes:--'twas but a meteor beamed.[534]

                             CLXXI.

    Woe unto us--not her--for she sleeps well:[535]
      The fickle reek of popular breath,[536] the tongue
      Of hollow counsel, the false oracle,
      Which from the birth of Monarchy hath rung
      Its knell in princely ears, till the o'erstung
      Nations have armed in madness--the strange fate
      Which tumbles mightiest sovereigns,[537] and hath flung
      Against their blind omnipotence a weight
    Within the opposing scale, which crushes soon or late,--[qa]

                            CLXXII.

    These might have been her destiny--but no--
      Our hearts deny it: and so young, so fair,
      Good without effort, great without a foe;
      But now a Bride and Mother--and now _there!_
      How many ties did that stern moment tear!
      From thy Sire's to his humblest subject's breast
      Is linked the electric chain of that despair,
      Whose shock was as an Earthquake's,[538] and opprest
    The land which loved thee so that none could love thee best.

                            CLXXIII.

    Lo, Nemi![539] navelled in the woody hills
      So far, that the uprooting Wind which tears
      The oak from his foundation, and which spills
      The Ocean o'er its boundary, and bears
      Its foam against the skies, reluctant spares
      The oval mirror of thy glassy lake;
      And calm as cherished hate, its surface wears[qb]
      A deep cold settled aspect nought can shake,
    All coiled into itself and round, as sleeps the snake.

                            CLXXIV.

    And near, Albano's scarce divided waves
      Shine from a sister valley;--and afar[31.H.]
      The Tiber winds, and the broad Ocean laves
      The Latian coast where sprung the Epic war,
      "Arms and the Man," whose re-ascending star
      Rose o'er an empire:--but beneath thy right[540]
      Tully reposed from Rome;--and where yon bar
      Of girdling mountains intercepts the sight[qc]
    The Sabine farm was tilled, the weary Bard's delight.

                             CLXXV.

    But I forget.--My Pilgrim's shrine is won,
      And he and I must part,--so let it be,--
      His task and mine alike are nearly done;
      Yet once more let us look upon the Sea;
      The Midland Ocean breaks on him and me,
      And from the Alban Mount we now behold
      Our friend of youth, that Ocean, which when we
      Beheld it last by Calpe's rock[541] unfold
    Those waves, we followed on till the dark Euxine rolled

                            CLXXVI.

    Upon the blue Symplegades:[32.H.] long years--
      Long, though not very many--since have done
      Their work on both; some suffering and some tears[qd]
      Have left us nearly where we had begun:
      Yet not in vain our mortal race hath run--
      We have had our reward--and it is here,--
      That we can yet feel gladdened by the Sun,
      And reap from Earth--Sea--joy almost as dear
    As if there were no Man to trouble what is clear.[542]

                            CLXXVII.

    Oh! that the Desert were my dwelling-place,[543]
      With one fair Spirit for my minister,
      That I might all forget the human race,
      And, hating no one, love but only her!
      Ye elements!--in whose ennobling stir
      I feel myself exalted--Can ye not
      Accord me such a Being? Do I err
      In deeming such inhabit many a spot?
    Though with them to converse can rarely be our lot.

                           CLXXVIII.

    There is a pleasure in the pathless woods,
      There is a rapture on the lonely shore,
      There is society, where none intrudes,
      By the deep Sea, and Music in its roar:
      I love not Man the less, but Nature more,
      From these our interviews, in which I steal
      From all I may be, or have been before,
      To mingle with the Universe,[544] and feel
    What I can ne'er express--yet can not all conceal.

                            CLXXIX.

    Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean--roll!
      Ten thousand fleets sweep over thee in vain;
      Man marks the earth with ruin--his control
      Stops with the shore;--upon the watery plain
      The wrecks are all thy deed, nor doth remain
      A shadow of man's ravage, save his own,
      When, for a moment, like a drop of rain,
      He sinks into thy depths with bubbling groan--
    Without a grave--unknelled, uncoffined, and unknown.[qe]

                             CLXXX.

    His steps are not upon thy paths,--thy fields
      Are not a spoil for him,--thou dost arise
      And shake him from thee; the vile strength he wields
      For Earth's destruction thou dost all despise,
      Spurning him from thy bosom to the skies--[545]
      And send'st him, shivering in thy playful spray
      And howling, to his Gods, where haply lies
      His petty hope in some near port or bay,
    And dashest him again to Earth:--there let him lay.[qf][546]

                            CLXXXI.

    The armaments which thunderstrike the walls
      Of rock-built cities, bidding nations quake,
      And Monarchs tremble in their Capitals,
      The oak Leviathans,[547] whose huge ribs make[qg]
      Their clay creator the vain title take
      Of Lord of thee, and Arbiter of War--
      These are thy toys, and, as the snowy flake,
      They melt into thy yeast of waves, which mar
    Alike the Armada's pride or spoils of Trafalgar.[548]

                            CLXXXII.

    Thy shores are empires, changed in all save thee--
      Assyria--Greece--Rome--Carthage--what are they?[549]
      Thy waters washed[550] them power while they were free,[qh]
      And many a tyrant since; their shores obey
      The stranger, slave, or savage; their decay
      Has dried up realms to deserts:--not so thou,
      Unchangeable save to thy wild waves' play,[qi]
      Time writes no wrinkle on thine azure brow--
    Such as Creation's dawn beheld, thou rollest now.

                           CLXXXIII.

    Thou glorious mirror, where the Almighty's form
      Glasses itself in tempests; in all time,
      Calm or convulsed--in breeze, or gale, or storm--
      Icing the Pole, or in the torrid clime
      Dark-heaving--boundless, endless, and sublime--
      The image of Eternity-the throne[qj]
      Of the Invisible; even from out thy slime[551]
      The monsters of the deep are made--each Zone
    Obeys thee--thou goest forth, dread, fathomless, alone.

                            CLXXXIV.

    And I have loved thee, Ocean! and my joy
      Of youthful sports was on thy breast to be
      Borne, like thy bubbles, onward: from a boy[552]
      I wantoned with thy breakers--they to me
      Were a delight; and if the freshening sea
      Made them a terror--'twas a pleasing fear,
      For I was as it were a Child of thee,
      And trusted to thy billows far and near,
    And laid my hand upon thy mane--as I do here.[553]

                            CLXXXV.

    My task is done--my song hath ceased--my theme
      Has died into an echo; it is fit[qk]
      The spell should break of this protracted dream.
      The torch shall be extinguished which hath lit
      My midnight lamp--and what is writ, is writ,--
      Would it were worthier! but I am not now
      That which I have been--and my visions flit
      Less palpably before me--and the glow
    Which in my Spirit dwelt is fluttering, faint, and low.

                            CLXXXVI.

    Farewell! a word that must be, and hath been--
      A sound which makes us linger;--yet--farewell![ql]
      Ye! who have traced the Pilgrim to the scene[qm]
      Which is his last--if in your memories dwell
      A thought which once was his--if on ye swell
      A single recollection--not in vain
      He wore his sandal-shoon, and scallop-shell;
      Farewell! with _him_ alone may rest the pain,
    If such there were--with _you_, the Moral of his Strain.[554]


                              POEMS 1809-1813.



                    THE GIRL OF CADIZ.[1]

                    1.

    Oh never talk again to me
      Of northern climes and British ladies;
    It has not been your lot to see,[a]
      Like me, the lovely Girl of Cadiz.
    Although her eye be not of blue,
      Nor fair her locks, like English lasses,
    How far its own expressive hue
      The languid azure eye surpasses!

                    2.

    Prometheus-like from heaven she stole
      The fire that through those silken lashes
    In darkest glances seems to roll,
      From eyes that cannot hide their flashes:
    And as along her bosom steal
      In lengthened flow her raven tresses,
    You'd swear each clustering lock could feel,
      And curled to give her neck caresses.

                    3.

    Our English maids are long to woo,[b][2]
      And frigid even in possession;
    And if their charms be fair to view,
      Their lips are slow at Love's confession;
    But, born beneath a brighter sun,
      For love ordained the Spanish maid is,
    And who,--when fondly, fairly won,--
      Enchants you like the Girl of Cadiz?

                    4.

    The Spanish maid is no coquette,
      Nor joys to see a lover tremble,
    And if she love, or if she hate,
      Alike she knows not to dissemble.
    Her heart can ne'er be bought or sold--
      Howe'er it beats, it beats sincerely;
    And, though it will not bend to gold,
      'Twill love you long and love you dearly.

                    5.

    The Spanish girl that meets your love
      Ne'er taunts you with a mock denial,
    For every thought is bent to prove
      Her passion in the hour of trial.
    When thronging foemen menace Spain,
      She dares the deed and shares the danger;
    And should her lover press the plain,
      She hurls the spear, her love's avenger.

                    6.

    And when, beneath the evening star,
      She mingles in the gay Bolero,[3]
    Or sings to her attuned guitar
      Of Christian knight or Moorish hero,
    Or counts her beads with fairy hand
      Beneath the twinkling rays of Hesper,[c]
    Or joins Devotion's choral band,
      To chaunt the sweet and hallowed vesper;--

                    7.

    In each her charms the heart must move
      Of all who venture to behold her;
    Then let not maids less fair reprove
      Because her bosom is not colder:
    Through many a clime 'tis mine to roam
      Where many a soft and melting maid is,
    But none abroad, and few at home,
      May match the dark-eyed Girl of Cadiz.[d]

                                                                     1809.

        LINES WRITTEN IN AN ALBUM, AT MALTA.[e][4]

                    1.

    As o'er the cold sepulchral stone
      Some _name_ arrests the passer-by;
    Thus, when thou view'st this page alone,
      May _mine_ attract thy pensive eye!

                    2.

    And when by thee that name is read,
      Perchance in some succeeding year,
    Reflect on _me_ as on the _dead_,
      And think my _Heart_ is buried _here_.

                                              Malta, _September_ 14, 1809.
                           [First published, _Childe Harold_, 1812 (4to).]



                     TO FLORENCE.[f]

                    1.

    Oh Lady! when I left the shore,
      The distant shore which gave me birth,
    I hardly thought to grieve once more,
      To quit another spot on earth:

                    2.

    Yet here, amidst this barren isle,
      Where panting Nature droops the head,
    Where only thou art seen to smile,
      I view my parting hour with dread.

                    3.

    Though far from Albin's craggy shore,
      Divided by the dark-blue main;
    A few, brief, rolling seasons o'er,
      Perchance I view her cliffs again:

                    4.

    But wheresoe'er I now may roam,
      Through scorching clime, and varied sea,
    Though Time restore me to my home,
      I ne'er shall bend mine eyes on thee:

                    5.

    On thee, in whom at once conspire
      All charms which heedless hearts can move,
    Whom but to see is to admire,
      And, oh! forgive the word--to love.

                    6.

    Forgive the word, in one who ne'er
      With such a word can more offend;
    And since thy heart I cannot share,
      Believe me, what I am, thy friend.

                    7.

    And who so cold as look on thee,
      Thou lovely wand'rer, and be less?
    Nor be, what man should ever be,
      The friend of Beauty in distress?

                    8.

    Ah! who would think that form had past
      Through Danger's most destructive path,[g]
    Had braved the death-winged tempest's blast,
      And 'scaped a Tyrant's fiercer wrath?

                    9.

    Lady! when I shall view the walls
      Where free Byzantium once arose,
    And Stamboul's Oriental halls
      The Turkish tyrants now enclose;

                    10.

    Though mightiest in the lists of fame,
      That glorious city still shall be;
    On me 'twill hold a dearer claim,
      As spot of thy nativity:

                    11.

    And though I bid thee now farewell,
      When I behold that wondrous scene--
    Since where thou art I may not dwell--
      'Twill soothe to be where thou hast been.

                                                       _September_, 1809.

        STANZAS COMPOSED DURING A THUNDERSTORM.[h][5]

                    1.

    Chill and mirk is the nightly blast,
      Where Pindus' mountains rise,
    And angry clouds are pouring fast
      The vengeance of the skies.

                    2.

    Our guides are gone, our hope is lost,
      And lightnings, as they play,
    But show where rocks our path have crost,
      Or gild the torrent's spray.

                    3.

    Is yon a cot I saw, though low?
      When lightning broke the gloom--
    How welcome were its shade!--ah, no!
      'Tis but a Turkish tomb.

                    4.

    Through sounds of foaming waterfalls,
      I hear a voice exclaim--
    My way-worn countryman, who calls
      On distant England's name.

                    5.

    A shot is fired--by foe or friend?
      Another--'tis to tell
    The mountain-peasants to descend,
      And lead us where they dwell.

                    6.

    Oh! who in such a night will dare
      To tempt the wilderness?
    And who 'mid thunder-peals can hear
      Our signal of distress?

                    7.

    And who that heard our shouts would rise
      To try the dubious road?
    Nor rather deem from nightly cries
      That outlaws were abroad.

                    8.

    Clouds burst, skies flash, oh, dreadful hour!
      More fiercely pours the storm!
    Yet here one thought has still the power
      To keep my bosom warm.

                    9.

    While wandering through each broken path,
      O'er brake and craggy brow;
    While elements exhaust their wrath,
      Sweet Florence, where art thou?

                    10.

    Not on the sea, not on the sea--
      Thy bark hath long been gone:
    Oh, may the storm that pours on me,
      Bow down my head alone!

                    11.

    Full swiftly blew the swift Siroc,
      When last I pressed thy lip;
    And long ere now, with foaming shock,
      Impelled thy gallant ship.

                    12.

    Now thou art safe; nay, long ere now
      Hast trod the shore of Spain;
    'Twere hard if aught so fair as thou
      Should linger on the main.

                    13.

    And since I now remember thee
      In darkness and in dread,
    As in those hours of revelry
      Which Mirth and Music sped;

                    14.

    Do thou, amid the fair white walls,
      If Cadiz yet be free,
    At times from out her latticed halls
      Look o'er the dark blue sea;

                    15.

    Then think upon Calypso's isles,
      Endeared by days gone by;
    To others give a thousand smiles,
      To me a single sigh.

                    16.

    And when the admiring circle mark
      The paleness of thy face,
    A half-formed tear, a transient spark
      Of melancholy grace,

                    17.

    Again thou'lt smile, and blushing shun
      Some coxcomb's raillery;
    Nor own for once thou thought'st on one,
      Who ever thinks on thee.

                    18.

    Though smile and sigh alike are vain,
      When severed hearts repine,
    My spirit flies o'er Mount and Main,
      And mourns in search of _thine_.

                                                       _October_ 11, 1809.

    STANZAS WRITTEN IN PASSING THE AMBRACIAN GULF.[i]

                    1.

    Through cloudless skies, in silvery sheen,
      Full beams the moon on Actium's coast:
    And on these waves, for Egypt's queen,
      The ancient world was won and lost.

                    2.

    And now upon the scene I look,
      The azure grave of many a Roman;
    Where stern Ambition once forsook
      His wavering crown to follow _Woman_.

                    3.

    Florence! whom I will love as well
      (As ever yet was said or sung,
    Since Orpheus sang his spouse from Hell)
      Whilst _thou_ art _fair_ and _I_ am _young_;

                    4.

    Sweet Florence! those were pleasant times,
      When worlds were staked for Ladies' eyes:
    Had bards as many realms as rhymes,[j]
      Thy charms might raise new Antonies.[k]

                    5.

    Though Fate forbids such things to be,[l]
      Yet, by thine eyes and ringlets curled!
    I cannot _lose_ a _world_ for thee,
      But would not lose _thee_ for a _World_.[6]

         THE SPELL IS BROKE, THE CHARM IS FLOWN![m]

            WRITTEN AT ATHENS, JANUARY 16, 1810.


    The spell is broke, the charm is flown!
      Thus is it with Life's fitful fever:
    We madly smile when we should groan;
      Delirium is our best deceiver.
    Each lucid interval of thought
      Recalls the woes of Nature's charter;
    And _He_ that acts as _wise men ought_,
      But _lives_--as Saints have died--a martyr.

     WRITTEN AFTER SWIMMING FROM SESTOS TO ABYDOS.[7]

                    1.

    If, in the month of dark December,
      Leander, who was nightly wont
    (What maid will not the tale remember?)
      To cross thy stream, broad Hellespont!

                    2.

    If, when the wintry tempest roared,
      He sped to Hero, nothing loth,
    And thus of old thy current poured,
      Fair Venus! how I pity both!

                    3.

    For _me_, degenerate modern wretch,
      Though in the genial month of May,
    My dripping limbs I faintly stretch,
      And think I've done a feat to-day.

                    4.

    But since he crossed the rapid tide,
      According to the doubtful story,
    To woo,--and--Lord knows what beside,
      And swam for Love, as I for Glory;

                    5.

    'Twere hard to say who fared the best:
      Sad mortals! thus the Gods still plague you!
    He lost his labour, I my jest:
      For he was drowned, and I've the ague.[8]

         IN THIS BOOK A TRAVELLER HAD WRITTEN:--

    "Fair Albion, smiling, sees her son depart
    To trace the birth and nursery of art:
    Noble his object, glorious is his aim;
    He comes to Athens, and he--writes his name."

         BENEATH WHICH LORD BYRON INSERTED THE FOLLOWING:--

    The modest bard, like many a bard unknown,
    Rhymes on our names, but wisely hides his own;
    But yet, whoe'er he be, to say no worse,
    His name would bring more credit than his verse.

          FRAGMENT FROM THE "MONK OF ATHOS."[14]

                    1.

    Beside the confines of the AEgean main,
       Where northward Macedonia bounds the flood,
    And views opposed the Asiatic plain,
       Where once the pride of lofty Ilion stood,
    Like the great Father of the giant brood,
       With lowering port majestic Athos stands,
    Crowned with the verdure of eternal wood,
       As yet unspoiled by sacrilegious hands,
    And throws his mighty shade o'er seas and distant lands.

                    2.

    And deep embosomed in his shady groves
       Full many a convent rears its glittering spire,
    Mid scenes where Heavenly Contemplation loves
       To kindle in her soul her hallowed fire,
    Where air and sea with rocks and woods conspire
       To breathe a sweet religious calm around,
    Weaning the thoughts from every low desire,
       And the wild waves that break with murmuring sound
    Along the rocky shore proclaim it holy ground.

                    3.

    Sequestered shades where Piety has given
       A quiet refuge from each earthly care,
    Whence the rapt spirit may ascend to Heaven!

    Oh, ye condemned the ills of life to bear!
       As with advancing age your woes increase,
    What bliss amidst these solitudes to share
       The happy foretaste of eternal Peace,
    Till Heaven in mercy bids your pain and sorrows cease.

    Dear object of defeated care!
      Though now of Love and thee bereft,
    To reconcile me with despair
      Thine image and my tears are left.

                    2.

    'Tis said with Sorrow Time can cope;
      But this I feel can ne'er be true:
    For by the death-blow of my Hope
      My Memory immortal grew.

                   "????? ?????? ??? ???????."
           ["Deu~te pai~des to~n E(lle/non."][16]

    Sons of the Greeks, arise!
      The glorious hour's gone forth,
    And, worthy of such ties,
      Display who gave us birth.

                    CHORUS.

    Sons of Greeks! let us go
    In arms against the foe,
    Till their hated blood shall flow
      In a river past our feet.

    Then manfully despising
      The Turkish tyrant's yoke,
    Let your country see you rising,
      And all her chains are broke.
    Brave shades of chiefs and sages,
      Behold the coming strife!
    Hellenes of past ages,
      Oh, start again to life!
    At the sound of my trumpet, breaking
      Your sleep, oh, join with me!
    And the seven-hilled city[17] seeking,
      Fight, conquer, till we're free.

                 Sons of Greeks, etc.

    Sparta, Sparta, why in slumbers
      Lethargic dost thou lie?
    Awake, and join thy numbers
      With Athens, old ally!
    Leonidas recalling,
      That chief of ancient song,
    Who saved ye once from falling,
      The terrible! the strong!
    Who made that bold diversion
      In old Thermopylae,
    And warring with the Persian
      To keep his country free;
    With his three hundred waging
      The battle, long he stood,
    And like a lion raging,
      Expired in seas of blood.

              TRANSLATION OF THE ROMAIC SONG,

                    "????? ???' ?? ????????,
                    ????????? ?????," ?.?.?.
                ["Mpe/no mes' to\ peribo/li,
                O(raiota/te Chaede/," k.t.l.][18]

    I enter thy garden of roses,
      Beloved and fair Haidee,
    Each morning where Flora reposes,
      For surely I see her in thee.
    Oh, Lovely! thus low I implore thee,
      Receive this fond truth from my tongue,
    Which utters its song to adore thee,
      Yet trembles for what it has sung;
    As the branch, at the bidding of Nature,
      Adds fragrance and fruit to the tree,
    Through her eyes, through her every feature,
      Shines the soul of the young Haidee.

    But the loveliest garden grows hateful
      When Love has abandoned the bowers;
    Bring me hemlock--since mine is ungrateful,
      That herb is more fragrant than flowers.
    The poison, when poured from the chalice,
      Will deeply embitter the bowl;
    But when drunk to escape from thy malice,
      The draught shall be sweet to my soul.
    Too cruel! in vain I implore thee
      My heart from these horrors to save:
    Will nought to my bosom restore thee?
      Then open the gates of the grave.

    As the chief who to combat advances
      Secure of his conquest before,
    Thus thou, with those eyes for thy lances,
      Hast pierced through my heart to its core.
    Ah, tell me, my soul! must I perish
      By pangs which a smile would dispel?
    Would the hope, which thou once bad'st me cherish,
      For torture repay me too well?
    Now sad is the garden of roses,
      Beloved but false Haidee!
    There Flora all withered reposes,
      And mourns o'er thine absence with me.

                                                                     1811.

                        ON PARTING.

                    1.

    The kiss, dear maid! thy lip has left
      Shall never part from mine,
    Till happier hours restore the gift
      Untainted back to thine.

                    2.

    Thy parting glance, which fondly beams,
      An equal love may see:[o]
    The tear that from thine eyelid streams
      Can weep no change in me.

                    3.

    I ask no pledge to make me blest
      In gazing when alone;[p]
    Nor one memorial for a breast,
      Whose thoughts are all thine own.

                    4.

    Nor need I write--to tell the tale
      My pen were doubly weak:
    Oh! what can idle words avail,[q]
      Unless the heart could speak?

                    5.

    By day or night, in weal or woe,
      That heart, no longer free,
    Must bear the love it cannot show,
      And silent ache for thee.

                   FAREWELL TO MALTA.[19]

    Adieu, ye joys of La Valette!
    Adieu, Sirocco, sun, and sweat!
    Adieu, thou palace rarely entered!
    Adieu, ye mansions where--I've ventured!
    Adieu, ye cursed streets of stairs![20]
    (How surely he who mounts them swears!)
    Adieu, ye merchants often failing!
    Adieu, thou mob for ever railing!
    Adieu, ye packets--without letters!
    Adieu, ye fools--who ape your betters!                               10
    Adieu, thou damned'st quarantine,
    That gave me fever, and the spleen!
    Adieu that stage which makes us yawn, Sirs,
    Adieu his Excellency's dancers![21]
    Adieu to Peter--whom no fault's in,
    But could not teach a colonel waltzing;
    Adieu, ye females fraught with graces!
    Adieu red coats, and redder faces!
    Adieu the supercilious air
    Of all that strut _en militaire_![22]                                20
    I go--but God knows when, or why,
    To smoky towns and cloudy sky,
    To things (the honest truth to say)
    As bad--but in a different way.

    Farewell to these, but not adieu,
    Triumphant sons of truest blue!
    While either Adriatic shore,[23]
    And fallen chiefs, and fleets no more,
    And nightly smiles, and daily dinners,[24]
    Proclaim you war and women's winners.                                30
    Pardon my Muse, who apt to prate is,
    And take my rhyme--because 'tis "gratis."

    And now I've got to Mrs. Fraser,[25]
    Perhaps you think I mean to praise her--
    And were I vain enough to think
    My praise was worth this drop of ink,
    A line--or two--were no hard matter,
    As here, indeed, I need not flatter:
    But she must be content to shine
    In better praises than in mine,                                      40
    With lively air, and open heart,
    And fashion's ease, without its art;
    Her hours can gaily glide along.
    Nor ask the aid of idle song.

    And now, O Malta! since thou'st got us,
    Thou little military hot-house!
    I'll not offend with words uncivil,
    And wish thee rudely at the Devil,
    But only stare from out my casement,
    And ask, "for what is such a place meant?"                           50
    Then, in my solitary nook,
    Return to scribbling, or a book,
    Or take my physic while I'm able
    (Two spoonfuls hourly, by this label),
    Prefer my nightcap to my beaver,
    And bless my stars I've got a fever.

                                                       _May_ 26, 1811.[26]

                    1.

    In the dome of my Sires as the clear moonbeam falls
    Through Silence and Shade o'er its desolate walls,
    It shines from afar like the glories of old;
    It gilds, but it warms not--'tis dazzling, but cold.

                    2.

    Let the Sunbeam be bright for the younger of days:
    'Tis the light that should shine on a race that decays,
    When the Stars are on high and the dews on the ground,
    And the long shadow lingers the ruin around.

                    3.

    And the step that o'erechoes the gray floor of stone
    Falls sullenly now, for 'tis only my own;
    And sunk are the voices that sounded in mirth,
    And empty the goblet, and dreary the hearth.

                    4.

    And vain was each effort to raise and recall
    The brightness of old to illumine our Hall;
    And vain was the hope to avert our decline,
    And the fate of my fathers had faded to mine.

                    5.

    And theirs was the wealth and the fulness of Fame,
    And mine to inherit too haughty a name;[r]
    And theirs were the times and the triumphs of yore,
    And mine to regret, but renew them no more.

                    6.

    And Ruin is fixed on my tower and my wall,
    Too hoary to fade, and too massy to fall;
    It tells not of Time's or the tempest's decay,[s]
    But the wreck of the line that have held it in sway.

                  EPISTLE TO A FRIEND,[27]

        IN ANSWER TO SOME LINES EXHORTING THE AUTHOR
           TO BE CHEERFUL, AND TO "BANISH CARE."

    "Oh! banish care"--such ever be
    The motto of _thy_ revelry!
    Perchance of _mine,_ when wassail nights
    Renew those riotous delights,
    Wherewith the children of Despair
    Lull the lone heart, and "banish care."
    But not in Morn's reflecting hour,
    When present, past, and future lower,
    When all I loved is changed or gone,
    Mock with such taunts the woes of one,
    Whose every thought--but let them pass--
    Thou know'st I am not what I was.
    But, above all, if thou wouldst hold
    Place in a heart that ne'er was cold,
    By all the powers that men revere,
    By all unto thy bosom dear,
    Thy joys below, thy hopes above,
    Speak--speak of anything but Love.

      'Twere long to tell, and vain to hear,
    The tale of one who scorns a tear;
    And there is little in that tale
    Which better bosoms would bewail.
    But mine has suffered more than well
    'Twould suit philosophy to tell.
    I've seen my bride another's bride,--
    Have seen her seated by his side,--
    Have seen the infant, which she bore,
    Wear the sweet smile the mother wore,
    When she and I in youth have smiled,
    As fond and faultless as her child;--
    Have seen her eyes, in cold disdain,
    Ask if I felt no secret pain;
    And _I_ have acted well my part,
    And made my cheek belie my heart,
    Returned the freezing glance she gave,
    Yet felt the while that _woman's_ slave;--
    Have kissed, as if without design,
    The babe which ought to have been mine,
    And showed, alas! in each caress
    Time had not made me love the less.

      But let this pass--I'll whine no more,
    Nor seek again an eastern shore;
    The world befits a busy brain,--
    I'll hie me to its haunts again.
    But if, in some succeeding year,[28]
    When Britain's "May is in the sere,"
    Thou hear'st of one, whose deepening crimes
    Suit with the sablest of the times,
    Of one, whom love nor pity sways,
    Nor hope of fame, nor good men's praise;
    One, who in stern Ambition's pride,
    Perchance not blood shall turn aside;
    One ranked in some recording page
    With the worst anarchs of the age,
    Him wilt thou _know_--and _knowing_ pause,
    Nor with the _effect_ forget the cause.

                     TO THYRZA.[t][29]

    Without a stone to mark the spot,[30]
      And say, what Truth might well have said,[u]
    By all, save one, perchance forgot,
      Ah! wherefore art thou lowly laid?
    By many a shore and many a sea[v]
      Divided, yet beloved in vain;
    The Past, the Future fled to thee,
      To bid us meet--no--ne'er again!
    Could this have been--a word, a look,
      That softly said, "We part in peace,"
    Had taught my bosom how to brook,
      With fainter sighs, thy soul's release.
    And didst thou not, since Death for thee
      Prepared a light and pangless dart,
    Once long for him thou ne'er shalt see,
      Who held, and holds thee in his heart?
    Oh! who like him had watched thee here?
      Or sadly marked thy glazing eye,
    In that dread hour ere Death appear,
      When silent Sorrow fears to sigh,
    Till all was past? But when no more
      'Twas thine to reck of human woe,
    Affection's heart-drops, gushing o'er,
      Had flowed as fast--as now they flow.
    Shall they not flow, when many a day[w]
      In these, to me, deserted towers,
    Ere called but for a time away,
      Affection's mingling tears were ours?
    Ours too the glance none saw beside;
      The smile none else might understand;
    The whispered thought of hearts allied,[x]
      The pressure of the thrilling hand;
    The kiss, so guiltless and refined,
      That Love each warmer wish forbore;
    Those eyes proclaimed so pure a mind,
      Ev'n Passion blushed to plead for more.[y]
    The tone, that taught me to rejoice,
      When prone, unlike thee, to repine;
    The song, celestial from thy voice,
      But sweet to me from none but thine;
    The pledge we wore--_I_ wear it still,
      But where is thine?--Ah! where art thou?
    Oft have I borne the weight of ill,
      But never bent beneath till now!
    Well hast thou left in Life's best bloom[z]
      The cup of Woe for me to drain.[aa]
    If rest alone be in the tomb,
      I would not wish thee here again:
    But if in worlds more blest than this
      Thy virtues seek a fitter sphere,
    Impart some portion of thy bliss,
      To wean me from mine anguish here.
    Teach me--too early taught by thee!
      To bear, forgiving and forgiven:
    On earth thy love was such to me;
      It fain would form my hope in Heaven![ab]

            AWAY, AWAY, YE NOTES OF WOE![ac][31]

                    1.

    Away, away, ye notes of Woe!
      Be silent, thou once soothing Strain,
    Or I must flee from hence--for, oh!
      I dare not trust those sounds again.[ad]
    To me they speak of brighter days--
      But lull the chords, for now, alas![ae]
    I must not think, I may not gaze,[af]
      On what I _am_--on what I _was_.

                    2.

    The voice that made those sounds more sweet[ag]
      Is hushed, and all their charms are fled;
    And now their softest notes repeat
      A dirge, an anthem o'er the dead!
    Yes, Thyrza! yes, they breathe of thee,
      Beloved dust! since dust thou art;
    And all that once was Harmony
      Is worse than discord to my heart!

                    3.

    'Tis silent all!--but on my ear[ah]
      The well remembered Echoes thrill;
    I hear a voice I would not hear,
      A voice that now might well be still:
    Yet oft my doubting Soul 'twill shake;
      Ev'n Slumber owns its gentle tone,
    Till Consciousness will vainly wake
      To listen, though the dream be flown.

                    4.

    Sweet Thyrza! waking as in sleep,
      Thou art but now a lovely dream;
    A Star that trembled o'er the deep,
      Then turned from earth its tender beam.
    But he who through Life's dreary way
      Must pass, when Heaven is veiled in wrath,
    Will long lament the vanished ray
      That scattered gladness o'er his path.

           ONE STRUGGLE MORE, AND I AM FREE.[ai]

                    1.

    One struggle more, and I am free
      From pangs that rend my heart in twain;[aj]
    One last long sigh to Love and thee,
      Then back to busy life again.
    It suits me well to mingle now
      With things that never pleased before:[ak]
    Though every joy is fled below,
      What future grief can touch me more?[al]

                    2.

    Then bring me wine, the banquet bring;
      Man was not formed to live alone:
    I'll be that light unmeaning thing
      That smiles with all, and weeps with none.
    It was not thus in days more dear,
      It never would have been, but thou[am]
    Hast fled, and left me lonely here;
      Thou'rt nothing,--all are nothing now.

                    3.

    In vain my lyre would lightly breathe!
      The smile that Sorrow fain would wear
    But mocks the woe that lurks beneath,
      Like roses o'er a sepulchre.
    Though gay companions o'er the bowl
      Dispel awhile the sense of ill;
    Though Pleasure fires the maddening soul,
      The Heart,--the Heart is lonely still!

                    4.

    On many a lone and lovely night
      It soothed to gaze upon the sky;
    For then I deemed the heavenly light
      Shone sweetly on thy pensive eye:
    And oft I thought at Cynthia's noon,
      When sailing o'er the AEgean wave,
    "Now Thyrza gazes on that moon"--
      Alas, it gleamed upon her grave!

                    5.

    When stretched on Fever's sleepless bed,
      And sickness shrunk my throbbing veins,
    "'Tis comfort still," I faintly said,[an]
      "That Thyrza cannot know my pains:"
    Like freedom to the time-worn slave--[ao]
      A boon 'tis idle then to give--
    Relenting Nature vainly gave[32]
      My life, when Thyrza ceased to live!

                    6.

    My Thyrza's pledge in better days,[ap]
      When Love and Life alike were new!
    How different now thou meet'st my gaze!
      How tinged by time with Sorrow's hue!
    The heart that gave itself with thee
      Is silent--ah, were mine as still!
    Though cold as e'en the dead can be,
      It feels, it sickens with the chill.

                    7.

    Thou bitter pledge! thou mournful token!
      Though painful, welcome to my breast!
    Still, still, preserve that love unbroken,
      Or break the heart to which thou'rt pressed.
    Time tempers Love, but not removes,
      More hallowed when its Hope is fled:
    Oh! what are thousand living loves
      To that which cannot quit the dead?

                           [First published, _Childe Harold,_ 1812 (4to).]



                        EUTHANASIA.

                    1.

    When Time, or soon or late, shall bring
      The dreamless sleep that lulls the dead,
    Oblivion! may thy languid wing
      Wave gently o'er my dying bed!

                    2.

    No band of friends or heirs be there,[33]
      To weep, or wish, the coming blow:
    No maiden, with dishevelled hair,
      To feel, or feign, decorous woe.

                    3.

    But silent let me sink to Earth,
      With no officious mourners near:
    I would not mar one hour of mirth,
      Nor startle Friendship with a fear.

                    4.

    Yet Love, if Love in such an hour
      Could nobly check its useless sighs,
    Might then exert its latest power
      In her who lives, and him who dies.

                    5.

    'Twere sweet, my Psyche! to the last
      Thy features still serene to see:
    Forgetful of its struggles past,
      E'en Pain itself should smile on thee.

                    6.

    But vain the wish--for Beauty still
      Will shrink, as shrinks the ebbing breath;
    And Woman's tears, produced at will,
      Deceive in life, unman in death.

                    7.

    Then lonely be my latest hour,
      Without regret, without a groan;
    For thousands Death hath ceased to lower,
      And pain been transient or unknown.

                    8.

    "Aye but to die, and go," alas!
      Where all have gone, and all must go!
    To be the nothing that I was
      Ere born to life and living woe!

                    9.

    Count o'er the joys thine hours have seen,
      Count o'er thy days from anguish free,
    And know, whatever thou hast been,
      'Tis something better not to be.

                [First published, _Childe Harold_, 1812 (Second Edition).]



         AND THOU ART DEAD, AS YOUNG AND FAIR.[aq]

"Heu, quanto minus est cum reliquis versari quam tui meminisse!"[34]

                    1.

    And thou art dead, as young and fair
      As aught of mortal birth;
    And form so soft, and charms so rare,
      Too soon returned to Earth![ar]
    Though Earth received them in her bed,
    And o'er the spot the crowd may tread[as]
      In carelessness or mirth,
    There is an eye which could not brook
    A moment on that grave to look.

                    2.

    I will not ask where thou liest low,[at]
      Nor gaze upon the spot;
    There flowers or weeds at will may grow,
      So I behold them not:[au]
    It is enough for me to prove
    That what I loved, and long must love,
      Like common earth can rot;[av]
    To me there needs no stone to tell,
    'Tis Nothing that I loved so well[aw]

                    3.

    Yet did I love thee to the last
      As fervently as thou,[ax]
    Who didst not change through all the past,
      And canst not alter now.
    The love where Death has set his seal,
    Nor age can chill, nor rival steal,[ay]
      Nor falsehood disavow:[az]
    And, what were worse, thou canst not see[ba]
    Or wrong, or change, or fault in me.[bb]

                    4.

    The better days of life were ours;
      The worst can be but mine:
    The sun that cheers, the storm that lowers,[bc]
      Shall never more be thine.
    The silence of that dreamless sleep[bd]
    I envy now too much to weep;
      Nor need I to repine,
    That all those charms have passed away
    I might have watched through long decay.

                    5.

    The flower in ripened bloom unmatched
      Must fall the earliest prey;[be]
    Though by no hand untimely snatched,
      The leaves must drop away:
    And yet it were a greater grief
    To watch it withering, leaf by leaf,
      Than see it plucked to-day;
    Since earthly eye but ill can bear
    To trace the change to foul from fair.

                    6.

    I know not if I could have borne[bf]
      To see thy beauties fade;
    The night that followed such a morn
      Had worn a deeper shade:
    Thy day without a cloud hath passed,[bg]
    And thou wert lovely to the last;
      Extinguished, not decayed;
    As stars that shoot along the sky[bh]
    Shine brightest as they fall from high.

                    7.

    As once I wept, if I could weep,
      My tears might well be shed,
    To think I was not near to keep
      One vigil o'er thy bed;
    To gaze, how fondly! on thy face,
    To fold thee in a faint embrace,
      Uphold thy drooping head;
    And show that love, however vain,
    Nor thou nor I can feel again.

                    8.

    Yet how much less it were to gain,
      Though thou hast left me free,[bi]
    The loveliest things that still remain,
      Than thus remember thee!
    The all of thine that cannot die
    Through dark and dread Eternity[bj]
      Returns again to me,
    And more thy buried love endears
    Than aught, except its living years.

           IF SOMETIMES IN THE HAUNTS OF MEN.[bl]

                    1.

    If sometimes in the haunts of men
      Thine image from my breast may fade,
    The lonely hour presents again
      The semblance of thy gentle shade:
    And now that sad and silent hour
      Thus much of thee can still restore,
    And sorrow unobserved may pour
      The plaint she dare not speak before.

                    2.

    Oh, pardon that in crowds awhile
      I waste one thought I owe to thee,
    And self-condemned, appear to smile,
      Unfaithful to thy memory:
    Nor deem that memory less dear,
      That then I seem not to repine;
    I would not fools should overhear
      One sigh that should be wholly _thine_.

                    3.

    If not the Goblet pass unquaffed,
      It is not drained to banish care;
    The cup must hold a deadlier draught
      That brings a Lethe for despair.
    And could Oblivion set my soul
      From all her troubled visions free,
    I'd dash to earth the sweetest bowl
      That drowned a single thought of thee.

                    4.

    For wert thou vanished from my mind,
      Where could my vacant bosom turn?
    And who would then remain behind
      To honour thine abandoned Urn?
    No, no--it is my sorrow's pride
      That last dear duty to fulfil;
    Though all the world forget beside,
      'Tis meet that I remember still.

                    5.

    For well I know, that such had been
      Thy gentle care for him, who now
    Unmourned shall quit this mortal scene,
      Where none regarded him, but thou:
    And, oh! I feel in _that_ was given
      A blessing never meant for me;
    Thou wert too like a dream of Heaven,
      For earthly Love to merit thee.

                                                           March 14, 1812.

                     FROM THE TURKISH.

                    1.

    The chain I gave was fair to view,
      The lute I added sweet in sound;
    The heart that offered both was true,
      And ill deserved the fate it found.

                    2.

    These gifts were charmed by secret spell,
      Thy truth in absence to divine;
    And they have done their duty well,--
      Alas! they could not teach thee thine.

                    3.

    That chain was firm in every link,
      But not to bear a stranger's touch;
    That lute was sweet--till thou couldst think
      In other hands its notes were such.

                    4.

    Let him who from thy neck unbound
      The chain which shivered in his grasp,
    Who saw that lute refuse to sound,
      Restring the chords, renew the clasp.

                    5.

    When thou wert changed, they altered too;
      The chain is broke, the music mute,
    'Tis past--to them and thee adieu--
      False heart, frail chain, and silent lute.

             ADDRESS, SPOKEN AT THE OPENING OF
                    DRURY-LANE THEATRE,
              SATURDAY, OCTOBER 10, 1812.[39]

    In one dread night our city saw, and sighed,
    Bowed to the dust, the Drama's tower of pride;
    In one short hour beheld the blazing fane,
    Apollo sink, and Shakespeare cease to reign.

      Ye who beheld, (oh! sight admired and mourned,
    Whose radiance mocked the ruin it adorned!)
    Through clouds of fire the massy fragments riven,
    Like Israel's pillar, chase the night from heaven;
    Saw the long column of revolving flames
    Shake its red shadow o'er the startled Thames,[40]                   10
    While thousands, thronged around the burning dome,
    Shrank back appalled, and trembled for their home,
    As glared the volumed blaze, and ghastly shone[bn]
    The skies, with lightnings awful as their own,
    Till blackening ashes and the lonely wall[bo]
    Usurped the Muse's realm, and marked her fall;
    Say--shall this new, nor less aspiring pile,
    Reared where once rose the mightiest in our isle,
    Know the same favour which the former knew,
    A shrine for Shakespeare--worthy him and _you_?                      20

      Yes--it shall be--the magic of that name
    Defies the scythe of time, the torch of flame;[bp]
    On the same spot still consecrates the scene,
    And bids the Drama _be_ where she hath _been_:
    This fabric's birth attests the potent spell----
    Indulge our honest pride, and say, _How well_!

      As soars this fane to emulate the last,
    Oh! might we draw our omens from the past,
    Some hour propitious to our prayers may boast
    Names such as hallow still the dome we lost.                         30
    On Drury first your Siddons' thrilling art
    O'erwhelmed the gentlest, stormed the sternest heart.
    On Drury, Garrick's latest laurels grew;
    Here your last tears retiring Roscius drew,
    Sighed his last thanks, and wept his last adieu:
    But still for living wit the wreaths may bloom,
    That only waste their odours o'er the tomb.
    Such Drury claimed and claims--nor you refuse
    One tribute to revive his slumbering muse;
    With garlands deck your own Menander's head,                         40
    Nor hoard your honours idly for the dead![bq]
    Dear are the days which made our annals bright,
    Ere Garrick fled, or Brinsley[41] ceased to write[br]
    Heirs to their labours, like all high-born heirs,
    Vain of _our_ ancestry as they of _theirs_;
    While thus Remembrance borrows Banquo's glass
    To claim the sceptred shadows as they pass,
    And we the mirror hold, where imaged shine
    Immortal names, emblazoned on our line,
    Pause--ere their feebler offspring you condemn,                      50
    Reflect how hard the task to rival them!

      Friends of the stage! to whom both Players and Plays
    Must sue alike for pardon or for praise,
    Whose judging voice and eye alone direct
    The boundless power to cherish or reject;
    If e'er frivolity has led to fame,
    And made us blush that you forbore to blame--
    If e'er the sinking stage could condescend
    To soothe the sickly taste it dare not mend--
    All past reproach may present scenes refute,                         60
    And censure, wisely loud, be justly mute![42]
    Oh! since your fiat stamps the Drama's laws,
    Forbear to mock us with misplaced applause;
    So Pride shall doubly nerve the actor's powers,
    And Reason's voice be echoed back by ours!

      This greeting o'er--the ancient rule obeyed,[43]
    The Drama's homage by her herald paid--
    Receive _our welcome_ too--whose every tone
    Springs from our hearts, and fain would win your own.
    The curtain rises--may our stage unfold                              70
    Scenes not unworthy Drury's days of old!

                 PARENTHETICAL ADDRESS.[44]

                      BY DR. PLAGIARY.

  _Half stolen_, with acknowledgments, to be spoken in an
      inarticulate voice by Master ---- at the opening of the next
      new theatre. [Stolen parts marked with the inverted commas of
      quotation--thus "----".]

    "When energising objects men pursue,"
    Then Lord knows what is writ by Lord knows who.
    A modest Monologue you here survey,
    Hissed from the theatre the "other day,"
    As if Sir Fretful wrote "the slumberous" verse,
    And gave his son "the rubbish" to rehearse.
    "Yet at the thing you'd never be amazed,"
    Knew you the rumpus which the Author raised;
    "Nor even here your smiles would be represt,"
    Knew you these lines--the badness of the best,                       10
    "Flame! fire! and flame!" (words borrowed from Lucretius.[45])
    "Dread metaphors" which open wounds like issues!
    "And sleeping pangs awake--and----But away"--
    (Confound me if I know what next to say).
    Lo "Hope reviving re-expands her wings,"
    And Master G---- recites what Dr. Busby sings!--
    "If mighty things with small we may compare,"
    (Translated from the Grammar for the fair!)
    Dramatic "spirit drives a conquering car,"
    And burn'd poor Moscow like a tub of "tar."                          20
    "This spirit" "Wellington has shown in Spain,"
    To furnish Melodrames for Drury Lane.
    "Another Marlborough points to Blenheim's story,"
    And George and I will dramatise it for ye.

      "In Arts and Sciences our Isle hath shone"
    (This deep discovery is mine alone).
    Oh "British poesy, whose powers inspire"
    My verse--or I'm a fool--and Fame's a liar,
    "Thee we invoke, your Sister Arts implore"
    With "smiles," and "lyres," and "pencils," and much more.            30
    These, if we win the Graces, too, we gain
    _Disgraces_, too! "inseparable train!"
    "Three who have stolen their witching airs from Cupid"
    (You all know what I mean, unless you're stupid):
    "Harmonious throng" that I have kept _in petto_
    Now to produce in a "divine _sestetto_"!!
    "While Poesy," with these delightful doxies,
    "Sustains her part" in all the "upper" boxes!
    "Thus lifted gloriously, you'll sweep along,"
    Borne in the vast balloon of Busby's song;                           40
    "Shine in your farce, masque, scenery, and play"
    (For this last line George had a holiday).
    "Old Drury never, never soar'd so high,"
    So says the Manager, and so say I.
    "But hold," you say, "this self-complacent boast;"
    Is this the Poem which the public lost?
    "True--true--that lowers at once our mounting pride;"
    But lo;--the Papers print what you deride.
    "'Tis ours to look on _you_--_you_ hold the prize,"
    'Tis _twenty guineas_, as they advertise!                            50
    "A _double_ blessing your rewards impart"--
    I wish I had them, then, with all my heart.
    "Our _twofold_ feeling _owns_ its twofold cause,"
    Why son and I both beg for your applause.
    "When in your fostering beams you bid us live,"
    My next subscription list shall say how much you give!

     VERSES FOUND IN A SUMMER-HOUSE AT HALES-OWEN.[46]

    When Dryden's fool, "unknowing what he sought,"
    His hours in whistling spent, "for want of thought,"[47]
    This guiltless oaf his vacancy of sense
    Supplied, and amply too, by innocence:
    Did modern swains, possessed of Cymon's powers,
    In Cymon's manner waste their leisure hours,
    Th' offended guests would not, with blushing, see
    These fair green walks disgraced by infamy.
    Severe the fate of modern fools, alas!
    When vice and folly mark them as they pass.
    Like noxious reptiles o'er the whitened wall,
    The filth they leave still points out where they crawl.

                    1.

    Remember thee! remember thee!
      Till Lethe quench life's burning stream
    Remorse and Shame shall cling to thee,

                          TO TIME.

    Time! on whose arbitrary wing
      The varying hours must flag or fly,
    Whose tardy winter, fleeting spring,
      But drag or drive us on to die--
    Hail thou! who on my birth bestowed
      Those boons to all that know thee known;
    Yet better I sustain thy load,
      For now I bear the weight alone.
    I would not one fond heart should share
      The bitter moments thou hast given;
    And pardon thee--since thou couldst spare
      All that I loved, to peace or Heaven.
    To them be joy or rest--on me
      Thy future ills shall press in vain;
    I nothing owe but years to thee,
      A debt already paid in pain.
    Yet even that pain was some relief;
      It felt, but still forgot thy power:[bs]
    The active agony of grief
      Retards, but never counts the hour.[bt]
    In joy I've sighed to think thy flight
      Would soon subside from swift to slow;
    Thy cloud could overcast the light,
      But could not add a night to Woe;
    For then, however drear and dark,
      My soul was suited to thy sky;
    One star alone shot forth a spark
      To prove thee--not Eternity.
    That beam hath sunk--and now thou art
      A blank--a thing to count and curse
    Through each dull tedious trifling part,
      Which all regret, yet all rehearse.
    One scene even thou canst not deform--
      The limit of thy sloth or speed
    When future wanderers bear the storm
      Which we shall sleep too sound to heed.
    And I can smile to think how weak
      Thine efforts shortly shall be shown,
    When all the vengeance thou canst wreak
      Must fall upon--a nameless stone.

             TRANSLATION OF A ROMAIC LOVE SONG.

                    1.

    Ah! Love was never yet without
    The pang, the agony, the doubt,
    Which rends my heart with ceaseless sigh,
    While day and night roll darkling by.

                    2.

    Without one friend to hear my woe,
    I faint, I die beneath the blow.
    That Love had arrows, well I knew,
    Alas! I find them poisoned too.

                    3.

    Birds, yet in freedom, shun the net
    Which Love around your haunts hath set;
    Or, circled by his fatal fire,
    Your hearts shall burn, your hopes expire.

                    4.

    A bird of free and careless wing
    Was I, through many a smiling spring;
    But caught within the subtle snare,
    I burn, and feebly flutter there.

                    5.

    Who ne'er have loved, and loved in vain,
    Can neither feel nor pity pain,
    The cold repulse, the look askance,
    The lightning of Love's angry glance.

                    6.

    In flattering dreams I deemed thee mine;
    Now hope, and he who hoped, decline;
    Like melting wax, or withering flower,
    I feel my passion, and thy power.

                    7.

    My light of Life! ah, tell me why
    That pouting lip, and altered eye?
    My bird of Love! my beauteous mate!
    And art thou changed, and canst thou hate?

                    8.

    Mine eyes like wintry streams o'erflow:
    What wretch with me would barter woe?
    My bird! relent: one note could give
    A charm to bid thy lover live.

                    9.

    My curdling blood, my madd'ning brain,
    In silent anguish I sustain;
    And still thy heart, without partaking
    One pang, exults--while mine is breaking.

                    10.

    Pour me the poison; fear not thou!
    Thou canst not murder more than now:
    I've lived to curse my natal day,
    And Love, that thus can lingering slay.

                    11.

    My wounded soul, my bleeding breast,
    Can patience preach thee into rest?
    Alas! too late, I dearly know
    That Joy is harbinger of Woe.

      THOU ART NOT FALSE, BUT THOU ART FICKLE.[bu][50]

                    1.

    Thou art not false, but thou art fickle,
      To those thyself so fondly sought;
    The tears that thou hast forced to trickle
      Are doubly bitter from that thought:
    'Tis this which breaks the heart thou grievest,
    _Too well_ thou lov'st--_too soon_ thou leavest.

                    2.

    The wholly false the _heart_ despises,
      And spurns deceiver and deceit;
    But she who not a thought disguises,[bv]
      Whose love is as sincere as sweet,--
    When _she_ can change who loved so truly,
    It _feels_ what mine has _felt_ so newly.

                    3.

    To dream of joy and wake to sorrow
      Is doomed to all who love or live;
    And if, when conscious on the morrow,
      We scarce our Fancy can forgive,
    That cheated us in slumber only,
    To leave the waking soul more lonely,

                    4.

    What must they feel whom no false vision
      But truest, tenderest Passion warmed?
    Sincere, but swift in sad transition:
      As if a dream alone had charmed?
    Ah! sure such _grief_ is _Fancy's_ scheming,
    And all thy _Change_ can be but _dreaming!_

        [MS. M. First published, _Childe Harold_, 1814 (Seventh Edition).]



           ON BEING ASKED WHAT WAS THE "ORIGIN OF LOVE."[bw]

    The "Origin of Love!"--Ah, why
      That cruel question ask of me,
    When thou mayst read in many an eye
      He starts to life on seeing thee?
    And shouldst thou seek his _end_ to know:
      My heart forebodes, my fears foresee,
    He'll linger long in silent woe;
      But live until--I cease to be.

               [First published, _Childe Harold_, 1814 (Seventh Edition).]



                     ON THE QUOTATION,

    "And my true faith can alter never,
    Though thou art gone perhaps for ever."

                    1.

    And "thy true faith can alter never?"--
      Indeed it lasted for a--week!
    I know the length of Love's forever,
      And just expected such a freak.
    In peace we met, in peace we parted,
      In peace we vowed to meet again,
    And though I find thee fickle-hearted
      No pang of mine shall make thee vain.

                    2.

    One gone--'twas time to seek a second;
      In sooth 'twere hard to blame thy haste.
    And whatsoe'er thy love be reckoned,
      At least thou hast improved in taste:
    Though one was young, the next was younger,
      His love was new, mine too well known--
    And what might make the charm still stronger,
      The youth was present, I was flown.

                    3.

    Seven days and nights of single sorrow!
      Too much for human constancy!
    A fortnight past, why then to-morrow,
      His turn is come to follow me:
    And if each week you change a lover,
      And so have acted heretofore,
    Before a year or two is over
      We'll form a very pretty _corps_.

                    4.

    Adieu, fair thing! without upbraiding
      I fain would take a decent leave;
    Thy beauty still survives unfading,
      And undeceived may long deceive.
    With him unto thy bosom dearer
      Enjoy the moments as they flee;
    I only wish his love sincerer
      Than thy young heart has been to me.

                                                                     1812.
                              [From a MS. in the possession of Mr. Murray,
                                          now for the first time printed.]



          REMEMBER HIM, WHOM PASSION'S POWER.[51]

                    1.

    Remember him, whom Passion's power
      Severely--deeply--vainly proved:
    Remember thou that dangerous hour,
      When neither fell, though both were loved.[bx]

                    2.

    That yielding breast, that melting eye,[by]
      Too much invited to be blessed:
    That gentle prayer, that pleading sigh,
      The wilder wish reproved, repressed.

                    3.

    Oh! let me feel that all I lost[bz]
      But saved thee all that Conscience fears;
    And blush for every pang it cost
      To spare the vain remorse of years.

                    4.

    Yet think of this when many a tongue,
      Whose busy accents whisper blame,
    Would do the heart that loved thee wrong,
      And brand a nearly blighted name.[ca]

                    5.

    Think that, whate'er to others, thou
      Hast seen each selfish thought subdued:
    I bless thy purer soul even now,
      Even now, in midnight solitude.

                    6.

    Oh, God! that we had met in time,
      Our hearts as fond, thy hand more free;
    When thou hadst loved without a crime,
      And I been less unworthy thee![cb]

                    7.

    Far may thy days, as heretofore,[cc]
      From this our gaudy world be past!
    And that too bitter moment o'er,
      Oh! may such trial be thy last.

                    8.

    This heart, alas! perverted long,
      Itself destroyed might there destroy;
    To meet thee in the glittering throng,
      Would wake Presumption's hope of joy.[cd]

                    9.

    Then to the things whose bliss or woe,
      Like mine, is wild and worthless all,
    That world resign--such scenes forego,
      Where those who feel must surely fall.

                    10.

    Thy youth, thy charms, thy tenderness--
      Thy soul from long seclusion pure;
    From what even here hath passed, may guess
        What there thy bosom must endure.

                    11.

    Oh! pardon that imploring tear,
      Since not by Virtue shed in vain,
    My frenzy drew from eyes so dear;
      For me they shall not weep again.

                    12.

    Though long and mournful must it be,
      The thought that we no more may meet;
    Yet I deserve the stern decree,
      And almost deem the sentence sweet.

                    13.

    Still--had I loved thee less--my heart
      Had then less sacrificed to thine;
    It felt not half so much to part
      As if its guilt had made thee mine.

                                                                     1813.

            IMPROMPTU, IN REPLY TO A FRIEND.[52]

    When, from the heart where Sorrow sits,
      Her dusky shadow mounts too high,
    And o'er the changing aspect flits,
      And clouds the brow, or fills the eye;
    Heed not that gloom, which soon shall sink:
      My Thoughts their dungeon know too well;
    Back to my breast the Wanderers shrink,
      And _droop_ within their silent cell.[ce]

                          SONNET.

                        TO GENEVRA.

    Thine eyes' blue tenderness, thy long fair hair,
      And the warm lustre of thy features--caught
      From contemplation--where serenely wrought,
    Seems Sorrow's softness charmed from its despair--
    Have thrown such speaking sadness in thine air,
      That--but I know thy blessed bosom fraught
      With mines of unalloyed and stainless thought--
    I should have deemed thee doomed to earthly care.
    With such an aspect, by his colours blent,
      When from his beauty-breathing pencil born,
    (Except that _thou_ hast nothing to repent)
      The Magdalen of Guido saw the morn--
    Such seem'st thou--but how much more excellent!
      With nought Remorse can claim--nor Virtue scorn.

                        TO GENEVRA.

    Thy cheek is pale with thought, but not from woe,[cf]
      And yet so lovely, that if Mirth could flush
      Its rose of whiteness with the brightest blush,
    My heart would wish away that ruder glow:
    And dazzle not thy deep-blue eyes--but, oh!
      While gazing on them sterner eyes will gush,
      And into mine my mother's weakness rush,
    Soft as the last drops round Heaven's airy bow.
    For, through thy long dark lashes low depending,
      The soul of melancholy Gentleness
    Gleams like a Seraph from the sky descending,
      Above all pain, yet pitying all distress;
    At once such majesty with sweetness blending,
      I worship more, but cannot love thee less.

The tale which these disjointed fragments present, is founded upon
circumstances now less common in the East than formerly; either because
the ladies are more circumspect than in the "olden time," or because the
Christians have better fortune, or less enterprise. The story, when
entire, contained the adventures of a female slave, who was thrown, in
the Mussulman manner, into the sea for infidelity, and avenged by a
young Venetian, her lover, at the time the Seven Islands were possessed
by the Republic of Venice, and soon after the Arnauts were beaten back
from the Morea, which they had ravaged for some time subsequent to the
Russian invasion. The desertion of the Mainotes, on being refused the
plunder of Misitra, led to the abandonment of that enterprise, and to
the desolation of the Morea, during which the cruelty exercised on all
sides was unparalleled even in the annals of the faithful.

      No breath of air to break the wave
    That rolls below the Athenian's grave,
    That tomb[55] which, gleaming o'er the cliff,
    First greets the homeward-veering skiff
    High o'er the land he saved in vain;
    When shall such Hero live again?

           *       *       *       *       *

      Fair clime! where every season smiles[cg]
    Benignant o'er those blessed isles,
    Which, seen from far Colonna's height,
    Make glad the heart that hails the sight,                            10
    And lend to loneliness delight.
    There mildly dimpling, Ocean's cheek
    Reflects the tints of many a peak
    Caught by the laughing tides that lave
    These Edens of the eastern wave:
    And if at times a transient breeze
    Break the blue crystal of the seas,
    Or sweep one blossom from the trees,
    How welcome is each gentle air
    That wakes and wafts the odours there!                               20
    For there the Rose, o'er crag or vale,
    Sultana of the Nightingale,[56]
      The maid for whom his melody,
      His thousand songs are heard on high,
    Blooms blushing to her lover's tale:
    His queen, the garden queen, his Rose,
    Unbent by winds, unchilled by snows,
    Far from the winters of the west,
    By every breeze and season blest,
    Returns the sweets by Nature given                                   30
    In softest incense back to Heaven;
    And grateful yields that smiling sky
    Her fairest hue and fragrant sigh.
    And many a summer flower is there,
    And many a shade that Love might share,
    And many a grotto, meant for rest,
    That holds the pirate for a guest;
    Whose bark in sheltering cove below
    Lurks for the passing peaceful prow,
    Till the gay mariner's guitar[57]                                    40
    Is heard, and seen the Evening Star;
    Then stealing with the muffled oar,
    Far shaded by the rocky shore,
    Rush the night-prowlers on the prey,
    And turn to groans his roundelay.
    Strange--that where Nature loved to trace,
    As if for Gods, a dwelling place,
    And every charm and grace hath mixed
    Within the Paradise she fixed,
    There man, enamoured of distress,                                    50
    Should mar it into wilderness,[ch]
    And trample, brute-like, o'er each flower
    That tasks not one laborious hour;
    Nor claims the culture of his hand
    To bloom along the fairy land,
    But springs as to preclude his care,
    And sweetly woos him--but to spare!
    Strange--that where all is Peace beside,
    There Passion riots in her pride,
    And Lust and Rapine wildly reign                                     60
    To darken o'er the fair domain.
    It is as though the Fiends prevailed
    Against the Seraphs they assailed,
    And, fixed on heavenly thrones, should dwell
    The freed inheritors of Hell;
    So soft the scene, so formed for joy,
    So curst the tyrants that destroy!

      He who hath bent him o'er the dead[ci][58]
    Ere the first day of Death is fled,
    The first dark day of Nothingness,                                   70
    The last of Danger and Distress,
    (Before Decay's effacing fingers
    Have swept the lines where Beauty lingers,)
    And marked the mild angelic air,
    The rapture of Repose that's there,[cj]
    The fixed yet tender traits that streak
    The languor of the placid cheek,
    And--but for that sad shrouded eye,
      That fires not, wins not, weeps not, now,
      And but for that chill, changeless brow,                           80
      Where cold Obstruction's apathy[59]
      Appals the gazing mourner's heart,[ck]
      As if to him it could impart
      The doom he dreads, yet dwells upon;
      Yes, but for these and these alone,
      Some moments, aye, one treacherous hour,
      He still might doubt the Tyrant's power;
      So fair, so calm, so softly sealed,
      The first, last look by Death revealed![60]
      Such is the aspect of this shore;                                  90
      'Tis Greece, but living Greece no more![61]
      So coldly sweet, so deadly fair,
      We start, for Soul is wanting there.
      Hers is the loveliness in death,
      That parts not quite with parting breath;
      But beauty with that fearful bloom,
      That hue which haunts it to the tomb,
      Expression's last receding ray,
      A gilded Halo hovering round decay,
      The farewell beam of Feeling past away!                           100
    Spark of that flame, perchance of heavenly birth,
    Which gleams, but warms no more its cherished earth!

        Clime of the unforgotten brave![62]
      Whose land from plain to mountain-cave
      Was Freedom's home or Glory's grave!
      Shrine of the mighty! can it be,[cl]
      That this is all remains of thee?
      Approach, thou craven crouching slave:[63]
        Say, is not this Thermopylae?[cm]
      These waters blue that round you lave,--                          110
        Oh servile offspring of the free--
      Pronounce what sea, what shore is this?
      The gulf, the rock of Salamis!
      These scenes, their story not unknown,
      Arise, and make again your own;
      Snatch from the ashes of your Sires
      The embers of their former fires;
      And he who in the strife expires[cn]
      Will add to theirs a name of fear
      That Tyranny shall quake to hear,                                 120
      And leave his sons a hope, a fame,
      They too will rather die than shame:
      For Freedom's battle once begun,
      Bequeathed by bleeding Sire to Son,[co]
      Though baffled oft is ever won.
      Bear witness, Greece, thy living page!
      Attest it many a deathless age![cp]
      While Kings, in dusty darkness hid,
      Have left a nameless pyramid,
      Thy Heroes, though the general doom                               130
      Hath swept the column from their tomb,
      A mightier monument command,
      The mountains of their native land!
      There points thy Muse to stranger's eye[cq]
      The graves of those that cannot die!
      'Twere long to tell, and sad to trace,
      Each step from Splendour to Disgrace;
      Enough--no foreign foe could quell
      Thy soul, till from itself it fell;
      Yet! Self-abasement paved the way                                 140
      To villain-bonds and despot sway.

      What can he tell who treads thy shore?
        No legend of thine olden time,
      No theme on which the Muse might soar
      High as thine own in days of yore,
        When man was worthy of thy clime.
      The hearts within thy valleys bred,[cr]
      The fiery souls that might have led
        Thy sons to deeds sublime,
      Now crawl from cradle to the Grave,                               150
      Slaves--nay, the bondsmen of a Slave,[64]
        And callous, save to crime;
      Stained with each evil that pollutes
      Mankind, where least above the brutes;
      Without even savage virtue blest,
      Without one free or valiant breast,
      Still to the neighbouring ports they waft[cs]
      Proverbial wiles, and ancient craft;
      In this the subtle Greek is found,
      For this, and this alone, renowned.                               160
      In vain might Liberty invoke
      The spirit to its bondage broke
      Or raise the neck that courts the yoke:
      No more her sorrows I bewail,
      Yet this will be a mournful tale,
      And they who listen may believe,
      Who heard it first had cause to grieve.

           *       *       *       *       *

        Far, dark, along the blue sea glancing,
      The shadows of the rocks advancing
      Start on the fisher's eye like boat                               170
      Of island-pirate or Mainote;
      And fearful for his light caique,
      He shuns the near but doubtful creek:[ct]
      Though worn and weary with his toil,
      And cumbered with his scaly spoil,
      Slowly, yet strongly, plies the oar,
      Till Port Leone's safer shore
      Receives him by the lovely light
      That best becomes an Eastern night.

           *       *       *       *       *

        Who thundering comes on blackest steed,[65]                     180
      With slackened bit and hoof of speed?
      Beneath the clattering iron's sound
      The caverned Echoes wake around
      In lash for lash, and bound for bound:
      The foam that streaks the courser's side
      Seems gathered from the Ocean-tide:
      Though weary waves are sunk to rest,
      There's none within his rider's breast;
      And though to-morrow's tempest lower,
      'Tis calmer than thy heart, young Giaour![66]                     190
      I know thee not, I loathe thy race,
      But in thy lineaments I trace
      What Time shall strengthen, not efface:
      Though young and pale, that sallow front
      Is scathed by fiery Passion's brunt;
      Though bent on earth thine evil eye,[cu]
      As meteor-like thou glidest by,
      Right well I view and deem thee one
      Whom Othman's sons should slay or shun.

        On--on he hastened, and he drew                                 200
      My gaze of wonder as he flew:[cv]
      Though like a Demon of the night
      He passed, and vanished from my sight,
      His aspect and his air impressed
      A troubled memory on my breast,
      And long upon my startled ear
      Rung his dark courser's hoofs of fear.
      He spurs his steed; he nears the steep,
      That, jutting, shadows o'er the deep;
      He winds around; he hurries by;                                   210
      The rock relieves him from mine eye;
      For, well I ween, unwelcome he
      Whose glance is fixed on those that flee;
      And not a star but shines too bright
      On him who takes such timeless flight.[cw]
      He wound along; but ere he passed
      One glance he snatched, as if his last,
      A moment checked his wheeling steed,[67]
      A moment breathed him from his speed,
      A moment on his stirrup stood--                                   220
      Why looks he o'er the olive wood?[cx]
      The Crescent glimmers on the hill,
      The Mosque's high lamps are quivering still
      Though too remote for sound to wake
      In echoes of the far tophaike,[68]
      The flashes of each joyous peal
      Are seen to prove the Moslem's zeal.
      To-night, set Rhamazani's sun;
      To-night, the Bairam feast's begun;
      To-night--but who and what art thou                               230
      Of foreign garb and fearful brow?
      And what are these to thine or thee,
      That thou shouldst either pause or flee?

        He stood--some dread was on his face,
      Soon Hatred settled in its place:
      It rose not with the reddening flush
      Of transient Anger's hasty blush,[cy][69]
      But pale as marble o'er the tomb,
      Whose ghastly whiteness aids its gloom.
      His brow was bent, his eye was glazed;                            240
      He raised his arm, and fiercely raised,
      And sternly shook his hand on high,
      As doubting to return or fly;[cz]
      Impatient of his flight delayed,
      Here loud his raven charger neighed--
      Down glanced that hand, and grasped his blade;
      That sound had burst his waking dream,
      As Slumber starts at owlet's scream.
      The spur hath lanced his courser's sides;
      Away--away--for life he rides:                                    250
      Swift as the hurled on high jerreed[70]
      Springs to the touch his startled steed;
      The rock is doubled, and the shore
      Shakes with the clattering tramp no more;
      The crag is won, no more is seen
      His Christian crest and haughty mien.
      'Twas but an instant he restrained
      That fiery barb so sternly reined;[da]
      'Twas but a moment that he stood,
      Then sped as if by Death pursued;                                 260
      But in that instant o'er his soul
      Winters of Memory seemed to roll,
      And gather in that drop of time
      A life of pain, an age of crime.
      O'er him who loves, or hates, or fears,
      Such moment pours the grief of years:[db]
      What felt _he_ then, at once opprest
      By all that most distracts the breast?
      That pause, which pondered o'er his fate,
      Oh, who its dreary length shall date!                             270
      Though in Time's record nearly nought,
      It was Eternity to Thought![71]
      For infinite as boundless space
      The thought that Conscience must embrace,
      Which in itself can comprehend
      Woe without name, or hope, or end.[72]

        The hour is past, the Giaour is gone:
      And did he fly or fall alone?[dc]
      Woe to that hour he came or went!
      The curse for Hassan's sin was sent                               280
      To turn a palace to a tomb;
      He came, he went, like the Simoom,[73]
      That harbinger of Fate and gloom,
      Beneath whose widely-wasting breath
      The very cypress droops to death--
    Dark tree, still sad when others' grief is fled,
    The only constant mourner o'er the dead!

        The steed is vanished from the stall;
      No serf is seen in Hassan's hall;
      The lonely Spider's thin gray pall[dd]                            290
      Waves slowly widening o'er the wall;
      The Bat builds in his Haram bower,[74]
      And in the fortress of his power
      The Owl usurps the beacon-tower;
      The wild-dog howls o'er the fountain's brim,
      With baffled thirst, and famine, grim;
    For the stream has shrunk from its marble bed,
    Where the weeds and the desolate dust are spread.
      'Twas sweet of yore to see it play
      And chase the sultriness of day,                                  300
      As springing high the silver dew[de]
      In whirls fantastically flew,
      And flung luxurious coolness round
      The air, and verdure o'er the ground.
      'Twas sweet, when cloudless stars were bright,
      To view the wave of watery light,
      And hear its melody by night.
      And oft had Hassan's Childhood played
      Around the verge of that cascade;
      And oft upon his mother's breast                                  310
      That sound had harmonized his rest;
      And oft had Hassan's Youth along
      Its bank been soothed by Beauty's song;
      And softer seemed each melting tone
      Of Music mingled with its own.
      But ne'er shall Hassan's Age repose
      Along the brink at Twilight's close:
      The stream that filled that font is fled--
      The blood that warmed his heart is shed![df]
      And here no more shall human voice                                320
      Be heard to rage, regret, rejoice.
      The last sad note that swelled the gale
      Was woman's wildest funeral wail:
      That quenched in silence, all is still,
      But the lattice that flaps when the wind is shrill:
      Though raves the gust, and floods the rain,
      No hand shall close its clasp again.
      On desert sands 'twere joy to scan
      The rudest steps of fellow man,
      So here the very voice of Grief                                   330
      Might wake an Echo like relief--[dg]
      At least 'twould say, "All are not gone;
      There lingers Life, though but in one"--[dh]
      For many a gilded chamber's there,
      Which Solitude might well forbear;[75]
      Within that dome as yet Decay
      Hath slowly worked her cankering way--
      But gloom is gathered o'er the gate,
      Nor there the Fakir's self will wait;
      Nor there will wandering Dervise stay,                            340
      For Bounty cheers not his delay;
      Nor there will weary stranger halt
      To bless the sacred "bread and salt."[di][76]
        Alike must Wealth and Poverty
        Pass heedless and unheeded by,
        For Courtesy and Pity died
        With Hassan on the mountain side.
        His roof, that refuge unto men,
        Is Desolation's hungry den.
    The guest flies the hall, and the vassal from labour,               350
    Since his turban was cleft by the infidel's sabre![dj][77]

           *       *       *       *       *

          I hear the sound of coming feet,
        But not a voice mine ear to greet;
        More near--each turban I can scan,
        And silver-sheathed ataghan;[78]
        The foremost of the band is seen
        An Emir by his garb of green:[79]
    "Ho! who art thou?"--"This low salam[80]
    Replies of Moslem faith I am.[dk]
    The burthen ye so gently bear,                                      360
    Seems one that claims your utmost care,
    And, doubtless, holds some precious freight--
    My humble bark would gladly wait."[dl]

      "Thou speakest sooth: thy skiff unmoor,
    And waft us from the silent shore;
    Nay, leave the sail still furled, and ply
    The nearest oar that's scattered by,
    And midway to those rocks where sleep
    The channelled waters dark and deep.
    Rest from your task--so--bravely done,                              370
    Our course has been right swiftly run;
    Yet 'tis the longest voyage, I trow,
    That one of--[81] * * * "

           *       *       *       *       *

      Sullen it plunged, and slowly sank,
    The calm wave rippled to the bank;
    I watched it as it sank, methought
    Some motion from the current caught
    Bestirred it more,--'twas but the beam
    That checkered o'er the living stream:
    I gazed, till vanishing from view,                                  380
    Like lessening pebble it withdrew;
    Still less and less, a speck of white
    That gemmed the tide, then mocked the sight;
    And all its hidden secrets sleep,
    Known but to Genii of the deep,
    Which, trembling in their coral caves,
    They dare not whisper to the waves.

           *       *       *       *       *

      As rising on its purple wing
    The insect-queen[82] of Eastern spring,
    O'er emerald meadows of Kashmeer                                    390
    Invites the young pursuer near,
    And leads him on from flower to flower
    A weary chase and wasted hour,
    Then leaves him, as it soars on high,
    With panting heart and tearful eye:
    So Beauty lures the full-grown child,
    With hue as bright, and wing as wild:
    A chase of idle hopes and fears,
    Begun in folly, closed in tears.
    If won, to equal ills betrayed,[dm]                                 400
    Woe waits the insect and the maid;
    A life of pain, the loss of peace;
    From infant's play, and man's caprice:
    The lovely toy so fiercely sought
    Hath lost its charm by being caught,
    For every touch that wooed its stay
    Hath brushed its brightest hues away,
    Till charm, and hue, and beauty gone,
    'Tis left to fly or fall alone.
    With wounded wing, or bleeding breast,                              410
    Ah! where shall either victim rest?
    Can this with faded pinion soar
    From rose to tulip as before?
    Or Beauty, blighted in an hour,
    Find joy within her broken bower?
    No: gayer insects fluttering by
    Ne'er droop the wing o'er those that die,
    And lovelier things have mercy shown
    To every failing but their own,
    And every woe a tear can claim                                      420
    Except an erring Sister's shame.

           *       *       *       *       *

    The Mind, that broods o'er guilty woes,
      Is like the Scorpion girt by fire;
    In circle narrowing as it glows,[dn]
    The flames around their captive close,
    Till inly searched by thousand throes,
      And maddening in her ire,
    One sad and sole relief she knows--
    The sting she nourished for her foes,
    Whose venom never yet was vain,                                     430
    Gives but one pang, and cures all pain,
    And darts into her desperate brain:
    So do the dark in soul expire,
    Or live like Scorpion girt by fire;[83]
    So writhes the mind Remorse hath riven,[do]
    Unfit for earth, undoomed for heaven,
    Darkness above, despair beneath,
    Around it flame, within it death!

           *       *       *       *       *

      Black Hassan from the Haram flies,
    Nor bends on woman's form his eyes;                                 440
    The unwonted chase each hour employs,
    Yet shares he not the hunter's joys.
    Not thus was Hassan wont to fly
    When Leila dwelt in his Serai.
    Doth Leila there no longer dwell?
    That tale can only Hassan tell:
    Strange rumours in our city say
    Upon that eve she fled away
    When Rhamazan's[84] last sun was set,
    And flashing from each Minaret                                      450
    Millions of lamps proclaimed the feast
    Of Bairam through the boundless East.
    'Twas then she went as to the bath,
    Which Hassan vainly searched in wrath;
    For she was flown her master's rage
    In likeness of a Georgian page,
    And far beyond the Moslem's power
    Had wronged him with the faithless Giaour.
    Somewhat of this had Hassan deemed;
    But still so fond, so fair she seemed,                              460
    Too well he trusted to the slave
    Whose treachery deserved a grave:
    And on that eve had gone to Mosque,
    And thence to feast in his Kiosk.
    Such is the tale his Nubians tell,
    Who did not watch their charge too well;
    But others say, that on that night,
    By pale Phingari's[85] trembling light,
    The Giaour upon his jet-black steed
    Was seen, but seen alone to speed                                   470
    With bloody spur along the shore,
    Nor maid nor page behind him bore.

           *       *       *       *       *

      Her eye's dark charm 'twere vain to tell,
    But gaze on that of the Gazelle,
    It will assist thy fancy well;
    As large, as languishingly dark,
    But Soul beamed forth in every spark
    That darted from beneath the lid,
    Bright as the jewel of Giamschid.[86]
    Yea, _Soul_, and should our prophet say                             480
    That form was nought but breathing clay,
    By Alla! I would answer nay;
    Though on Al-Sirat's[87] arch I stood,
    Which totters o'er the fiery flood,
    With Paradise within my view,
    And all his Houris beckoning through.
    Oh! who young Leila's glance could read
    And keep that portion of his creed
    Which saith that woman is but dust,
    A soulless toy for tyrant's lust?[88]                               490
    On her might Muftis gaze, and own
    That through her eye the Immortal shone;
    On her fair cheek's unfading hue
    The young pomegranate's[89] blossoms strew
    Their bloom in blushes ever new;
    Her hair in hyacinthine flow,[90]
    When left to roll its folds below,
    As midst her handmaids in the hall
    She stood superior to them all,
    Hath swept the marble where her feet                                500
    Gleamed whiter than the mountain sleet
    Ere from the cloud that gave it birth
    It fell, and caught one stain of earth.
    The cygnet nobly walks the water;
    So moved on earth Circassia's daughter,
    The loveliest bird of Franguestan![91]
    As rears her crest the ruffled Swan,
      And spurns the wave with wings of pride,
    When pass the steps of stranger man
      Along the banks that bound her tide;                              510
    Thus rose fair Leila's whiter neck:--
    Thus armed with beauty would she check
    Intrusion's glance, till Folly's gaze
    Shrunk from the charms it meant to praise.
    Thus high and graceful was her gait;
    Her heart as tender to her mate;
    Her mate--stern Hassan, who was he?
    Alas! that name was not for thee![92]

           *       *       *       *       *

      Stern Hassan hath a journey ta'en
    With twenty vassals in his train,                                   520
    Each armed, as best becomes a man,
    With arquebuss and ataghan;
    The chief before, as decked for war,
    Bears in his belt the scimitar
    Stained with the best of Arnaut blood,
    When in the pass the rebels stood,
    And few returned to tell the tale
    Of what befell in Parne's vale.
    The pistols which his girdle bore
    Were those that once a Pasha wore,                                  530
    Which still, though gemmed and bossed with gold,
    Even robbers tremble to behold.
    'Tis said he goes to woo a bride
    More true than her who left his side;
    The faithless slave that broke her bower,
    And--worse than faithless--for a Giaour!

           *       *       *       *       *

      The sun's last rays are on the hill,
    And sparkle in the fountain rill,
    Whose welcome waters, cool and clear,
    Draw blessings from the mountaineer:                                540
    Here may the loitering merchant Greek
    Find that repose 'twere vain to seek
    In cities lodged too near his lord,
    And trembling for his secret hoard--
    Here may he rest where none can see,
    In crowds a slave, in deserts free;
    And with forbidden wine may stain
    The bowl a Moslem must not drain

           *       *       *       *       *

      The foremost Tartar's in the gap
    Conspicuous by his yellow cap;                                      550
    The rest in lengthening line the while
    Wind slowly through the long defile:
    Above, the mountain rears a peak,
    Where vultures whet the thirsty beak,
    And theirs may be a feast to-night,
    Shall tempt them down ere morrow's light;
    Beneath, a river's wintry stream
    Has shrunk before the summer beam,
    And left a channel bleak and bare,
    Save shrubs that spring to perish there:                            560
    Each side the midway path there lay
    Small broken crags of granite gray,
    By time, or mountain lightning, riven
    From summits clad in mists of heaven;
    For where is he that hath beheld
    The peak of Liakura[93] unveiled?

           *       *       *       *       *

      They reach the grove of pine at last;
    "Bismillah![94] now the peril's past;
    For yonder view the opening plain,
    And there we'll prick our steeds amain:"                            570
    The Chiaus[95] spake, and as he said,
    A bullet whistled o'er his head;
    The foremost Tartar bites the ground!
      Scarce had they time to check the rein,
    Swift from their steeds the riders bound;
      But three shall never mount again:
    Unseen the foes that gave the wound,
      The dying ask revenge in vain.
    With steel unsheathed, and carbine bent,
    Some o'er their courser's harness leant,                            580
      Half sheltered by the steed;
    Some fly beneath the nearest rock,
    And there await the coming shock,
      Nor tamely stand to bleed
    Beneath the shaft of foes unseen,
    Who dare not quit their craggy screen.
    Stern Hassan only from his horse
    Disdains to light, and keeps his course,
    Till fiery flashes in the van
    Proclaim too sure the robber-clan                                   590
    Have well secured the only way
    Could now avail the promised prey;
    Then curled his very beard[96] with ire,
    And glared his eye with fiercer fire;
    "Though far and near the bullets hiss,
    I've scaped a bloodier hour than this."
    And now the foe their covert quit,
    And call his vassals to submit;
    But Hassan's frown and furious word
    Are dreaded more than hostile sword,                                600
    Nor of his little band a man
    Resigned carbine or ataghan,
    Nor raised the craven cry, Amaun![97]
    In fuller sight, more near and near,
    The lately ambushed foes appear,
    And, issuing from the grove, advance
    Some who on battle-charger prance.
    Who leads them on with foreign brand
    Far flashing in his red right hand?
    "'Tis he!'tis he! I know him now;                                   610
    I know him by his pallid brow;
    I know him by the evil eye[98]
    That aids his envious treachery;
    I know him by his jet-black barb;
    Though now arrayed in Arnaut garb,
    Apostate from his own vile faith,
    It shall not save him from the death:
    'Tis he! well met in any hour,
    Lost Leila's love--accursed Giaour!"

      As rolls the river into Ocean,[99]                                620
    In sable torrent wildly streaming;
      As the sea-tide's opposing motion,
    In azure column proudly gleaming,
    Beats back the current many a rood,
    In curling foam and mingling flood,
    While eddying whirl, and breaking wave,
    Roused by the blast of winter, rave;
    Through sparkling spray, in thundering clash,
    The lightnings of the waters flash
    In awful whiteness o'er the shore,                                  630
    That shines and shakes beneath the roar;
    Thus--as the stream and Ocean greet,
    With waves that madden as they meet--
    Thus join the bands, whom mutual wrong,
    And fate, and fury, drive along.
    The bickering sabres' shivering jar;
      And pealing wide or ringing near
      Its echoes on the throbbing ear,
    The deathshot hissing from afar;
    The shock, the shout, the groan of war,                             640
      Reverberate along that vale,
      More suited to the shepherd's tale:
    Though few the numbers--theirs the strife,
    That neither spares nor speaks for life![dp]
    Ah! fondly youthful hearts can press,
    To seize and share the dear caress;
    But Love itself could never pant
    For all that Beauty sighs to grant
    With half the fervour Hate bestows
    Upon the last embrace of foes,                                      650
    When grappling in the fight they fold
    Those arms that ne'er shall lose their hold:
    Friends meet to part; Love laughs at faith;
    True foes, once met, are joined till death!

           *       *       *       *       *

      With sabre shivered to the hilt,
    Yet dripping with the blood he spilt;
    Yet strained within the severed hand
    Which quivers round that faithless brand;
    His turban far behind him rolled,
    And cleft in twain its firmest fold;                                660
    His flowing robe by falchion torn,
    And crimson as those clouds of morn
    That, streaked with dusky red, portend
    The day shall have a stormy end;
    A stain on every bush that bore
    A fragment of his palampore;[100]
    His breast with wounds unnumbered riven,
    His back to earth, his face to Heaven,
    Fall'n Hassan lies--his unclosed eye
    Yet lowering on his enemy,                                          670
    As if the hour that sealed his fate[101]
    Surviving left his quenchless hate;
    And o'er him bends that foe with brow
    As dark as his that bled below.

           *       *       *       *       *

      "Yes, Leila sleeps beneath the wave,
    But his shall be a redder grave;
    Her spirit pointed well the steel
    Which taught that felon heart to feel.
    He called the Prophet, but his power
    Was vain against the vengeful Giaour:                               680
    He called on Alla--but the word
    Arose unheeded or unheard.
    Thou Paynim fool! could Leila's prayer
    Be passed, and thine accorded there?
    I watched my time, I leagued with these,
    The traitor in his turn to seize;
    My wrath is wreaked, the deed is done,
    And now I go--but go alone."

      The browsing camels' bells are tinkling:[dq]
    His mother looked from her lattice high--[102]                      690
      She saw the dews of eve besprinkling
    The pasture green beneath her eye,
      She saw the planets faintly twinkling:
    "'Tis twilight--sure his train is nigh."
    She could not rest in the garden-bower,
    But gazed through the grate of his steepest tower.
    "Why comes he not? his steeds are fleet,
    Nor shrink they from the summer heat;
    Why sends not the Bridegroom his promised gift?
    Is his heart more cold, or his barb less swift?                     700
    Oh, false reproach! yon Tartar now
    Has gained our nearest mountain's brow,
    And warily the steep descends,
    And now within the valley bends;[dr]
    And he bears the gift at his saddle bow--
    How could I deem his courser slow?[ds]
    Right well my largess shall repay
    His welcome speed, and weary way."

      The Tartar lighted at the gate,
    But scarce upheld his fainting weight![dt]                          710
    His swarthy visage spake distress,
    But this might be from weariness;
    His garb with sanguine spots was dyed,
    But these might be from his courser's side;
    He drew the token from his vest--
    Angel of Death! 'tis Hassan's cloven crest!
    His calpac[103] rent--his caftan red--
    "Lady, a fearful bride thy Son hath wed:
    Me, not from mercy, did they spare,
    But this empurpled pledge to bear.                                  720
    Peace to the brave! whose blood is spilt:
    Woe to the Giaour! for his the guilt."

      A Turban[104] carved in coarsest stone,
    A Pillar with rank weeds o'ergrown,
    Whereon can now be scarcely read
    The Koran verse that mourns the dead,
    Point out the spot where Hassan fell
    A victim in that lonely dell.
    There sleeps as true an Osmanlie
    As e'er at Mecca bent the knee;                                     730
    As ever scorned forbidden wine,
    Or prayed with face towards the shrine,
    In orisons resumed anew
    At solemn sound of "Alla Hu!"[105]
    Yet died he by a stranger's hand,
    And stranger in his native land;
    Yet died he as in arms he stood,
    And unavenged, at least in blood.
    But him the maids of Paradise
      Impatient to their halls invite,                                  740
    And the dark heaven of Houris' eyes
      On him shall glance for ever bright;
    They come--their kerchiefs green they wave,[106]
    And welcome with a kiss the brave!
    Who falls in battle 'gainst a Giaour
    Is worthiest an immortal bower.

           *       *       *       *       *

      But thou, false Infidel! shall writhe
    Beneath avenging Monkir's[107] scythe;
    And from its torments 'scape alone
    To wander round lost Eblis'[108] throne;                            750
    And fire unquenched, unquenchable,
    Around, within, thy heart shall dwell;
    Nor ear can hear nor tongue can tell
    The tortures of that inward hell!
    But first, on earth as Vampire[109] sent,
    Thy corse shall from its tomb be rent:
    Then ghastly haunt thy native place,
    And suck the blood of all thy race;
    There from thy daughter, sister, wife,
    At midnight drain the stream of life;                               760
    Yet loathe the banquet which perforce
    Must feed thy livid living corse:
    Thy victims ere they yet expire
    Shall know the demon for their sire,
    As cursing thee, thou cursing them,
    Thy flowers are withered on the stem.
    But one that for thy crime must fall,
    The youngest, most beloved of all,
    Shall bless thee with a _father's_ name--
    That word shall wrap thy heart in flame!                            770
    Yet must thou end thy task, and mark
    Her cheek's last tinge, her eye's last spark,
    And the last glassy glance must view
    Which freezes o'er its lifeless blue;
    Then with unhallowed hand shalt tear
    The tresses of her yellow hair,
    Of which in life a lock when shorn
    Affection's fondest pledge was worn,
    But now is borne away by thee,
    Memorial of thine agony!                                            780
    Wet with thine own best blood shall drip
    Thy gnashing tooth and haggard lip;[110]
    Then stalking to thy sullen grave,
    Go--and with Gouls and Afrits rave;
    Till these in horror shrink away
    From Spectre more accursed than they!

    "How name ye yon lone Caloyer?[111]
      His features I have scanned before
    In mine own land: 'tis many a year,
      Since, dashing by the lonely shore,                               790
    I saw him urge as fleet a steed
    As ever served a horseman's need.
    But once I saw that face, yet then
    It was so marked with inward pain,
    I could not pass it by again;
    It breathes the same dark spirit now,
    As death were stamped upon his brow.[du]

    "'Tis twice three years at summer tide
      Since first among our freres he came;
    And here it soothes him to abide                                    800
      For some dark deed he will not name.
    But never at our Vesper prayer,
    Nor e'er before Confession chair
    Kneels he, nor recks he when arise
    Incense or anthem to the skies,
    But broods within his cell alone,
    His faith and race alike unknown.
    The sea from Paynim land he crost,
    And here ascended from the coast;
    Yet seems he not of Othman race,                                    810
    But only Christian in his face:
    I'd judge him some stray renegade,
    Repentant of the change he made,
    Save that he shuns our holy shrine,
    Nor tastes the sacred bread and wine.
    Great largess to these walls he brought,
    And thus our Abbot's favour bought;
    But were I Prior, not a day
    Should brook such stranger's further stay,
    Or pent within our penance cell                                     820
    Should doom him there for aye to dwell.
    Much in his visions mutters he
    Of maiden whelmed beneath the sea;[dv]
    Of sabres clashing, foemen flying,
    Wrongs avenged, and Moslem dying.
    On cliff he hath been known to stand,
    And rave as to some bloody hand
    Fresh severed from its parent limb,
    Invisible to all but him,
    Which beckons onward to his grave,                                  830
    And lures to leap into the wave."

      Dark and unearthly is the scowl
    That glares beneath his dusky cowl:
    The flash of that dilating eye
    Reveals too much of times gone by;
    Though varying, indistinct its hue,
    Oft with his glance the gazer rue,
    For in it lurks that nameless spell,
    Which speaks, itself unspeakable,
    A spirit yet unquelled and high,                                    840
    That claims and keeps ascendancy;
    And like the bird whose pinions quake,
    But cannot fly the gazing snake,
    Will others quail beneath his look,
    Nor 'scape the glance they scarce can brook.
    From him the half-affrighted Friar
    When met alone would fain retire,
    As if that eye and bitter smile
    Transferred to others fear and guile:
    Not oft to smile descendeth he,                                     850
    And when he doth 'tis sad to see
    That he but mocks at Misery.
    How that pale lip will curl and quiver!
    Then fix once more as if for ever;
    As if his sorrow or disdain
    Forbade him e'er to smile again.
    Well were it so--such ghastly mirth
    From joyaunce ne'er derived its birth.
    But sadder still it were to trace
    What once were feelings in that face:                               860
    Time hath not yet the features fixed,
    But brighter traits with evil mixed;
    And there are hues not always faded,
    Which speak a mind not all degraded
    Even by the crimes through which it waded:
    The common crowd but see the gloom
    Of wayward deeds, and fitting doom;
    The close observer can espy
    A noble soul, and lineage high:
    Alas! though both bestowed in vain,                                 870
    Which Grief could change, and Guilt could stain,
    It was no vulgar tenement
    To which such lofty gifts were lent,
    And still with little less than dread
    On such the sight is riveted.
    The roofless cot, decayed and rent,
      Will scarce delay the passer-by;
    The tower by war or tempest bent,
    While yet may frown one battlement,
      Demands and daunts the stranger's eye;                            880
    Each ivied arch, and pillar lone,
    Pleads haughtily for glories gone!
    "His floating robe around him folding,
      Slow sweeps he through the columned aisle;
    With dread beheld, with gloom beholding
      The rites that sanctify the pile.
    But when the anthem shakes the choir,
    And kneel the monks, his steps retire;
    By yonder lone and wavering torch
    His aspect glares within the porch;                                 890
    There will he pause till all is done--
    And hear the prayer, but utter none.
    See--by the half-illumined wall[dw]
    His hood fly back, his dark hair fall,
    That pale brow wildly wreathing round,
    As if the Gorgon there had bound
    The sablest of the serpent-braid
    That o'er her fearful forehead strayed:
    For he declines the convent oath,
    And leaves those locks unhallowed growth,                           900
    But wears our garb in all beside;
    And, not from piety but pride,
    Gives wealth to walls that never heard
    Of his one holy vow nor word.
    Lo!--mark ye, as the harmony[dx]
    Peals louder praises to the sky,
    That livid cheek, that stony air
    Of mixed defiance and despair!
    Saint Francis, keep him from the shrine![dy]
    Else may we dread the wrath divine                                  910
    Made manifest by awful sign.
    If ever evil angel bore
    The form of mortal, such he wore;
    By all my hope of sins forgiven,
    Such looks are not of earth nor heaven!"

      To Love the softest hearts are prone,
    But such can ne'er be all his own;
    Too timid in his woes to share,
    Too meek to meet, or brave despair;
    And sterner hearts alone may feel                                   920
    The wound that Time can never heal.
    The rugged metal of the mine
    Must burn before its surface shine,[dz][112]
    But plunged within the furnace-flame,
    It bends and melts--though still the same;
    Then tempered to thy want, or will,
    'Twill serve thee to defend or kill--
    A breast-plate for thine hour of need,
    Or blade to bid thy foeman bleed;
    But if a dagger's form it bear,                                     930
    Let those who shape its edge, beware!
    Thus Passion's fire, and Woman's art,
    Can turn and tame the sterner heart;
    From these its form and tone are ta'en,
    And what they make it, must remain,
    But break--before it bend again.

      If solitude succeed to grief,
    Release from pain is slight relief;
    The vacant bosom's wilderness
    Might thank the pang that made it less.[113]                        940
    We loathe what none are left to share:
    Even bliss--'twere woe alone to bear;
    The heart once left thus desolate
    Must fly at last for ease--to hate.
    It is as if the dead could feel[114]
    The icy worm around them steal,
    And shudder, as the reptiles creep
    To revel o'er their rotting sleep,
    Without the power to scare away
    The cold consumers of their clay!                                   950
    It is as if the desert bird,[115]
      Whose beak unlocks her bosom's stream
      To still her famished nestlings' scream,
    Nor mourns a life to them transferred,
    Should rend her rash devoted breast,
    And find them flown her empty nest.
    The keenest pangs the wretched find
      Are rapture to the dreary void,
    The leafless desert of the mind,
      The waste of feelings unemployed.                                 960
    Who would be doomed to gaze upon
    A sky without a cloud or sun?
    Less hideous far the tempest's roar,
    Than ne'er to brave the billows more--[ea]
    Thrown, when the war of winds is o'er,
    A lonely wreck on Fortune's shore,
    'Mid sullen calm, and silent bay,
    Unseen to drop by dull decay;--
    Better to sink beneath the shock
    Than moulder piecemeal on the rock!                                 970

      "Father! thy, days have passed in peace,
        'Mid counted beads, and countless prayer;
      To bid the sins of others cease,
        Thyself without a crime or care,
      Save transient ills that all must bear,
      Has been thy lot from youth to age;
      And thou wilt bless thee from the rage
      Of passions fierce and uncontrolled,
      Such as thy penitents unfold,
      Whose secret sins and sorrows rest                                980
      Within thy pure and pitying breast.
      My days, though few, have passed below
      In much of Joy, but more of Woe;
      Yet still in hours of love or strife,
      I've 'scaped the weariness of Life:
      Now leagued with friends, now girt by foes,
      I loathed the languor of repose.
      Now nothing left to love or hate,
      No more with hope or pride elate,
      I'd rather be the thing that crawls                               990
      Most noxious o'er a dungeon's walls,[116]
      Than pass my dull, unvarying days,
      Condemned to meditate and gaze.
      Yet, lurks a wish within my breast
      For rest--but not to feel 'tis rest.
      Soon shall my Fate that wish fulfil;
        And I shall sleep without the dream
      Of what I was, and would be still
        Dark as to thee my deeds may seem:[eb]
      My memory now is but the tomb                                    1000
      Of joys long dead; my hope, their doom:
      'Though better to have died with those
      Than bear a life of lingering woes.
      My spirit shrunk not to sustain
      The searching throes of ceaseless pain;
      Nor sought the self-accorded grave
      Of ancient fool and modern knave:
      Yet death I have not feared to meet;
      And in the field it had been sweet,
      Had Danger wooed me on to move                                   1010
      The slave of Glory, not of Love.
      I've braved it--not for Honour's boast;
      I smile at laurels won or lost;
      To such let others carve their way,
      For high renown, or hireling pay:
      But place again before my eyes
      Aught that I deem a worthy prize--
      The maid I love, the man I hate--
      And I will hunt the steps of fate,
      To save or slay, as these require,                               1020
      Through rending steel, and rolling fire:[ec]
      Nor needst thou doubt this speech from one
      Who would but do--what he _hath_ done.
      Death is but what the haughty brave,
      The weak must bear, the wretch must crave;
      Then let life go to Him who gave:
      I have not quailed to Danger's brow
      When high and happy--need I _now_?

      "I loved her, Friar! nay, adored--
        But these are words that all can use--                         1030
      I proved it more in deed than word;
      There's blood upon that dinted sword,
        A stain its steel can never lose:
      'Twas shed for her, who died for me,
        It warmed the heart of one abhorred:
      Nay, start not--no--nor bend thy knee,
        Nor midst my sin such act record;
      Thou wilt absolve me from the deed,
      For he was hostile to thy creed!
      The very name of Nazarene                                        1040
      Was wormwood to his Paynim spleen.
      Ungrateful fool! since but for brands
      Well wielded in some hardy hands,
      And wounds by Galileans given--
      The surest pass to Turkish heaven--
      For him his Houris still might wait
      Impatient at the Prophet's gate.
      I loved her--Love will find its way
      Through paths where wolves would fear to prey;
      And if it dares enough,'twere hard                               1050
      If Passion met not some reward--
      No matter how, or where, or why,
      I did not vainly seek, nor sigh:
      Yet sometimes, with remorse, in vain
      I wish she had not loved again.
      She died--I dare not tell thee how;
      But look--'tis written on my brow!
      There read of Cain the curse and crime,
      In characters unworn by Time:
      Still, ere thou dost condemn me, pause;                          1060
      Not mine the act, though I the cause.
      Yet did he but what I had done
      Had she been false to more than one.
      Faithless to him--he gave the blow;
      But true to me--I laid him low:
      Howe'er deserved her doom might be,
      Her treachery was truth to me;
      To me she gave her heart, that all
      Which Tyranny can ne'er enthrall;
      And I, alas! too late to save!                                   1070
      Yet all I then could give, I gave--
      'Twas some relief--our foe a grave.[ed]
      His death sits lightly; but her fate
      Has made me--what thou well mayst hate.
        His doom was sealed--he knew it well,
      Warned by the voice of stern Taheer,
      Deep in whose darkly boding ear[117]
      The deathshot pealed of murder near,
        As filed the troop to where they fell!
      He died too in the battle broil,                                 1080
      A time that heeds nor pain nor toil;
      One cry to Mahomet for aid,
      One prayer to Alla all he made:
      He knew and crossed me in the fray--
      I gazed upon him where he lay,
      And watched his spirit ebb away:
      Though pierced like pard by hunter's steel,
      He felt not half that now I feel.
      I searched, but vainly searched, to find
      The workings of a wounded mind;                                  1090
      Each feature of that sullen corse
      Betrayed his rage, but no remorse.[118]
      Oh, what had Vengeance given to trace
      Despair upon his dying face!
      The late repentance of that hour
      When Penitence hath lost her power
      To tear one terror from the grave,[ee]
      And will not soothe, and cannot save.

      "The cold in clime are cold in blood,
      Their love can scarce deserve the name;                          1100
      But mine was like the lava flood
        That boils in AEtna's breast of flame.
      I cannot prate in puling strain
      Of Ladye-love, and Beauty's chain:
      If changing cheek, and scorching vein,[ef]
      Lips taught to writhe, but not complain,
      If bursting heart, and maddening brain,
      And daring deed, and vengeful steel,
      And all that I have felt, and feel,
      Betoken love--that love was mine,                                1110
      And shown by many a bitter sign.
      'Tis true, I could not whine nor sigh,
      I knew but to obtain or die.
      I die--but first I have possessed,
      And come what may, I _have been_ blessed.
      Shall I the doom I sought upbraid?
      No--reft of all, yet undismayed[eg]
      But for the thought of Leila slain,
      Give me the pleasure with the pain,
      So would I live and love again.                                  1120
      I grieve, but not, my holy Guide!
      For him who dies, but her who died:
      She sleeps beneath the wandering wave--
      Ah! had she but an earthly grave,
      This breaking heart and throbbing head
      Should seek and share her narrow bed.
      She was a form of Life and Light,[119]
      That, seen, became a part of sight;
      And rose, where'er I turned mine eye,
      The Morning-star of Memory!                                      1130

      "Yes, Love indeed is light from heaven;[eh][120]
        A spark of that immortal fire
      With angels shared, by Alia given,
        To lift from earth our low desire.
      Devotion wafts the mind above,
      But Heaven itself descends in Love;
      A feeling from the Godhead caught,
      To wean from self each sordid thought;
      A ray of Him who formed the whole;
      A Glory circling round the soul!                                 1140
      I grant _my_ love imperfect, all
      That mortals by the name miscall;
      Then deem it evil, what thou wilt;
      But say, oh say, _hers_ was not Guilt!
      She was my Life's unerring Light:
      That quenched--what beam shall break my night?[ei]
      Oh! would it shone to lead me still,
      Although to death or deadliest ill!
      Why marvel ye, if they who lose
        This present joy, this future hope,                            1150
        No more with Sorrow meekly cope;
      In phrensy then their fate accuse;
      In madness do those fearful deeds
        That seem to add but Guilt to Woe?
      Alas! the breast that inly bleeds
        Hath nought to dread from outward blow:
      Who falls from all he knows of bliss,
      Cares little into what abyss.[ej]
      Fierce as the gloomy vulture's now
        To thee, old man, my deeds appear:                             1160
      I read abhorrence on thy brow,
        And this too was I born to bear!
      'Tis true, that, like that bird of prey,
      With havock have I marked my way:
      But this was taught me by the dove,
      To die--and know no second love.
      This lesson yet hath man to learn,
      Taught by the thing he dares to spurn:
      The bird that sings within the brake,
      The swan that swims upon the lake,                               1170
      One mate, and one alone, will take.
      And let the fool still prone to range,[ek]
      And sneer on all who cannot change,
      Partake his jest with boasting boys;
      I envy not his varied joys,
      But deem such feeble, heartless man,
      Less than yon solitary swan;
      Far, far beneath the shallow maid[el]
      He left believing and betrayed.
      Such shame at least was never mine--                             1180
      Leila! each thought was only thine!
      My good, my guilt, my weal, my woe,
      My hope on high--my all below.
      Each holds no other like to thee,
      Or, if it doth, in vain for me:
      For worlds I dare not view the dame
      Resembling thee, yet not the same.
      The very crimes that mar my youth,
      This bed of death--attest my truth!
      'Tis all too late--thou wert, thou art                           1190
      The cherished madness of my heart![em]

      "And she was lost--and yet I breathed,
        But not the breath of human life:
      A serpent round my heart was wreathed,
        And stung my every thought to strife.
      Alike all time, abhorred all place,[en]
      Shuddering I shrank from Nature's face,
      Where every hue that charmed before
      The blackness of my bosom wore.
      The rest thou dost already know,                                 1200
      And all my sins, and half my woe.
      But talk no more of penitence;
      Thou seest I soon shall part from hence:
      And if thy holy tale were true,
      The deed that's done canst _thou_ undo?
      Think me not thankless--but this grief
      Looks not to priesthood for relief.[eo][121]
      My soul's estate in secret guess:
      But wouldst thou pity more, say less.
      When thou canst bid my Leila live,                               1210
      Then will I sue thee to forgive;
      Then plead my cause in that high place
      Where purchased masses proffer grace.[ep]
      Go, when the hunter's hand hath wrung
      From forest-cave her shrieking young,
      And calm the lonely lioness:
    But soothe not--mock not _my_ distress!

      "In earlier days, and calmer hours,
        When heart with heart delights to blend,
      Where bloom my native valley's bowers,[eq]                       1220
        I had--Ah! have I now?--a friend![er]
      To him this pledge I charge thee send,[es]
        Memorial of a youthful vow;

        Though souls absorbed like mine allow
      Brief thought to distant Friendship's claim,
      Yet dear to him my blighted name.
      'Tis strange--he prophesied my doom,
        And I have smiled--I then could smile--
      When Prudence would his voice assume,                            1230
        And warn--I recked not what--the while:
      But now Remembrance whispers o'er[et]
      Those accents scarcely marked before.
      Say--that his bodings came to pass,
        And he will start to hear their truth,
        And wish his words had not been sooth:
      Tell him--unheeding as I was,
        Through many a busy bitter scene
        Of all our golden youth had been,
      In pain, my faltering tongue had tried                           1240
      To bless his memory--ere I died;
      But Heaven in wrath would turn away,
      If Guilt should for the guiltless pray.
      I do not ask him not to blame,
      Too gentle he to wound my name;
      And what have I to do with Fame?
      I do not ask him not to mourn,
      Such cold request might sound like scorn;
      And what than Friendship's manly tear
      May better grace a brother's bier?                               1250
      But bear this ring, his own of old,
      And tell him--what thou dost behold!
      The withered frame, the ruined mind,
      The wrack by passion left behind,
      A shrivelled scroll, a scattered leaf,
      Seared by the autumn blast of Grief!

      But could not, for my burning brow
      Throbbed to the very brain as now:
      I wished but for a single tear,
      As something welcome, new, and dear:
      I wished it then, I wish it still;
      Despair is stronger than my will.
      Waste not thine orison, despair[eu]
      Is mightier than thy pious prayer:
      I would not, if I might, be blest;
      I want no Paradise, but rest.                                    1270
      'Twas then--I tell thee--father! then
      I saw her; yes, she lived again;
      And shining in her white symar[122]
      As through yon pale gray cloud the star
      Which now I gaze on, as on her,
      Who looked and looks far lovelier;
      Dimly I view its trembling spark;[ev]
      To-morrow's night shall be more dark;
      And I, before its rays appear,
      That lifeless thing the living fear.                             1280
      I wander--father! for my soul
      Is fleeting towards the final goal.
      I saw her--friar! and I rose
      Forgetful of our former woes;
      And rushing from my couch, I dart,
      And clasp her to my desperate heart;
      I clasp--what is it that I clasp?
      No breathing form within my grasp,
      No heart that beats reply to mine--
      Yet, Leila! yet the form is thine!                               1290
      And art thou, dearest, changed so much
      As meet my eye, yet mock my touch?
      Ah! were thy beauties e'er so cold,
      I care not--so my arms enfold
      The all they ever wished to hold.
      Alas! around a shadow prest
      They shrink upon my lonely breast;
      Yet still 'tis there! In silence stands,
      And beckons with beseeching hands!
      With braided hair, and bright-black eye--                        1300
      I knew 'twas false--she could not die!
      But _he_ is dead! within the dell
      I saw him buried where he fell;
      He comes not--for he cannot break
      From earth;--why then art _thou_ awake?
      They told me wild waves rolled above
      The face I view--the form I love;
      They told me--'twas a hideous tale!--
      I'd tell it, but my tongue would fail:
      If true, and from thine ocean-cave                               1310
      Thou com'st to claim a calmer grave,
      Oh! pass thy dewy fingers o'er
      This brow that then will burn no more;
      Or place them on my hopeless heart:
      But, Shape or Shade! whate'er thou art,
      In mercy ne'er again depart!
      Or farther with thee bear my soul
      Than winds can waft or waters roll!

           *       *       *       *       *

      "Such is my name, and such my tale.
        Confessor! to thy secret ear                                   1320
      I breathe the sorrows I bewail,
        And thank thee for the generous tear
      This glazing eye could never shed.
      Then lay me with the humblest dead,[ew]
      And, save the cross above my head,
      Be neither name nor emblem spread,
      By prying stranger to be read,
      Or stay the passing pilgrim's tread."[123]

    He passed--nor of his name and race
    He left a token or a trace,                                        1330
    Save what the Father must not say
    Who shrived him on his dying day:
    This broken tale was all we knew[ex]
    Of her he loved, or him he slew.
                                   to

                         the right honourable

                              LORD HOLLAND,

                                this tale

                            is inscribed, with

                         every sentiment of regard

                               and respect,

                         by his gratefully obliged

                            and sincere friend,

                                                 BYRON.[ey]




                        THE BRIDE OF ABYDOS.[124]



                      CANTO THE FIRST.

                    I.

    Know ye the land where the cypress and myrtle[125]
      Are emblems of deeds that are done in their clime?
    Where the rage of the vulture, the love of the turtle,
      Now melt into sorrow, now madden to crime?
    Know ye the land of the cedar and vine,
    Where the flowers ever blossom, the beams ever shine;
    Where the light wings of Zephyr, oppressed with perfume,
    Wax faint o'er the gardens of Gul[126] in her bloom;
    Where the citron and olive are fairest of fruit,
    And the voice of the nightingale never is mute;[127]                 10
    Where the tints of the earth, and the hues of the sky,
    In colour though varied, in beauty may vie,
    And the purple of Ocean is deepest in dye;
    Where the virgins are soft as the roses they twine,
    And all, save the spirit of man, is divine--
    Tis the clime of the East--'tis the land of the Sun--
    Can he smile on such deeds as his children have done?[128]
    Oh! wild as the accents of lovers' farewell[ez]
    Are the hearts which they bear, and the tales which they tell.

                    II.[fa]

        Begirt with many a gallant slave,                                20
        Apparelled as becomes the brave,
        Awaiting each his Lord's behest
        To guide his steps, or guard his rest,
        Old Giaffir sate in his Divan:
          Deep thought was in his aged eye;
        And though the face of Mussulman
          Not oft betrays to standers by
      The mind within, well skilled to hide
      All but unconquerable pride,
      His pensive cheek and pondering brow[fb]                           30
      Did more than he was wont avow.

                    III.

    "Let the chamber be cleared."--The train disappeared--
      "Now call me the chief of the Haram guard"--
    With Giaffir is none but his only son,
      And the Nubian awaiting the sire's award.
      "Haroun--when all the crowd that wait
      Are passed beyond the outer gate,
      (Woe to the head whose eye beheld
      My child Zuleika's face unveiled!)
      Hence, lead my daughter from her tower--[fc]                       40
      Her fate is fixed this very hour;
      Yet not to her repeat my thought--
      By me alone be duty taught!"

      "Pacha! to hear is to obey."--
      No more must slave to despot say--
      Then to the tower had ta'en his way:
      But here young Selim silence brake,
        First lowly rendering reverence meet;
      And downcast looked, and gently spake,
        Still standing at the Pacha's feet:                              50
      For son of Moslem must expire,
      Ere dare to sit before his sire!
      "Father! for fear that thou shouldst chide
      My sister, or her sable guide--
      Know--for the fault, if fault there be,
      Was mine--then fall thy frowns on me!
      So lovelily the morning shone,
        That--let the old and weary sleep--
      I could not; and to view alone
        The fairest scenes of land and deep,                             60
      With none to listen and reply
      To thoughts with which my heart beat high
      Were irksome--for whate'er my mood,
      In sooth I love not solitude;
      I on Zuleika's slumber broke,
        And, as thou knowest that for me
        Soon turns the Haram's grating key,
      Before the guardian slaves awoke
      We to the cypress groves had flown,
      And made earth, main, and heaven our own!                          70
      There lingered we, beguiled too long
      With Mejnoun's tale, or Sadi's song;[fd][129]
      Till I, who heard the deep tambour[130]
      Beat thy Divan's approaching hour,
      To thee, and to my duty true,
      Warned by the sound, to greet thee flew:
      But there Zuleika wanders yet--
      Nay, Father, rage not--nor forget
      That none can pierce that secret bower
      But those who watch the women's tower."                            80

                    IV.

    "Son of a slave"--the Pacha said--
    "From unbelieving mother bred,
    Vain were a father's hope to see
    Aught that beseems a man in thee.
    Thou, when thine arm should bend the bow,
      And hurl the dart, and curb the steed,
      Thou, Greek in soul if not in creed,
    Must pore where babbling waters flow,[fe]
    And watch unfolding roses blow.
    Would that yon Orb, whose matin glow                                 90
    Thy listless eyes so much admire,
    Would lend thee something of his fire!
    Thou, who woulds't see this battlement
    By Christian cannon piecemeal rent;
    Nay, tamely view old Stambol's wall
    Before the dogs of Moscow fall,
    Nor strike one stroke for life and death
    Against the curs of Nazareth!
    Go--let thy less than woman's hand
    Assume the distaff--not the brand.                                  100
    But, Haroun!--to my daughter speed:
    And hark--of thine own head take heed--
    If thus Zuleika oft takes wing--
    Thou see'st yon bow--it hath a string!"

                    V.

    No sound from Selim's lip was heard,
      At least that met old Giaffir's ear,
    But every frown and every word
    Pierced keener than a Christian's sword.
      "Son of a slave!--reproached with fear!
      Those gibes had cost another dear.                                110
    Son of a slave!--and _who_ my Sire?"
      Thus held his thoughts their dark career;
    And glances ev'n of more than ire[ff]
      Flash forth, then faintly disappear.
    Old Giaffir gazed upon his son
      And started; for within his eye
    He read how much his wrath had done;
    He saw rebellion there begun:
      "Come hither, boy--what, no reply?
    I mark thee--and I know thee too;                                   120
    But there be deeds thou dar'st not do:
    But if thy beard had manlier length,
    And if thy hand had skill and strength,
    I'd joy to see thee break a lance,
    Albeit against my own perchance."
    As sneeringly these accents fell,
    On Selim's eye he fiercely gazed:
      That eye returned him glance for glance,
    And proudly to his Sire's was raised[fg],
      Till Giaffir's quailed and shrunk askance--                       130
    And why--he felt, but durst not tell.
    "Much I misdoubt this wayward boy
    Will one day work me more annoy:
    I never loved him from his birth,
    And--but his arm is little worth,
    And scarcely in the chase could cope
    With timid fawn or antelope,
    Far less would venture into strife
    Where man contends for fame and life--
      I would not trust that look or tone:                              140
    No--nor the blood so near my own.[fh]
    That blood--he hath not heard--no more--
    I'll watch him closer than before.
    He is an Arab[131] to my sight,
    Or Christian crouching in the fight--[fi]
    But hark!--I hear Zuleika's voice;
      Like Houris' hymn it meets mine ear:
    She is the offspring of my choice;
      Oh! more than ev'n her mother dear,
    With all to hope, and nought to fear--                              150
    My Peri! ever welcome here![fj]
    Sweet, as the desert fountain's wave
    To lips just cooled in time to save--
      Such to my longing sight art thou;
    Nor can they waft to Mecca's shrine
    More thanks for life, than I for thine,
      Who blest thy birth and bless thee now."[fk]

                    VI.

    Fair, as the first that fell of womankind,
      When on that dread yet lovely serpent smiling,
    Whose Image then was stamped upon her mind--                        160
      But once beguiled--and ever more beguiling;
    Dazzling, as that, oh! too transcendent vision
      To Sorrow's phantom-peopled slumber given,
    When heart meets heart again in dreams Elysian,
      And paints the lost on Earth revived in Heaven;
    Soft, as the memory of buried love;
    Pure, as the prayer which Childhood wafts above;
    Was she--the daughter of that rude old Chief,
    Who met the maid with tears--but not of grief.

    Who hath not proved how feebly words essay[132]                     170
    To fix one spark of Beauty's heavenly ray?
    Who doth not feel, until his failing sight[fl]
    Faints into dimness with its own delight,
    His changing cheek, his sinking heart confess
    The might--the majesty of Loveliness?
    Such was Zuleika--such around her shone
    The nameless charms unmarked by her alone--
    The light of Love, the purity of Grace,[fm]
    The mind, the Music[133] breathing from her face,
    The heart whose softness harmonized the whole,                      180
    And oh! that eye was in itself a Soul!

    Her graceful arms in meekness bending
      Across her gently-budding breast;
    At one kind word those arms extending
      To clasp the neck of him who blest
      His child caressing and carest,
      Zuleika came--and Giaffir felt
      His purpose half within him melt:
      Not that against her fancied weal
      His heart though stern could ever feel;                           190
      Affection chained her to that heart;
      Ambition tore the links apart.

                    VII.

    "Zuleika! child of Gentleness!
      How dear this very day must tell,
    When I forget my own distress,
      In losing what I love so well,
    To bid thee with another dwell:
    Another! and a braver man
    Was never seen in battle's van.
    We Moslem reck not much of blood:                                   200
      But yet the line of Carasman[134]
    Unchanged, unchangeable hath stood
      First of the bold Timariot bands
    That won and well can keep their lands.[fn]
    Enough that he who comes to woo[fo]
    Is kinsman of the Bey Oglou:[135]
    His years need scarce a thought employ;
    I would not have thee wed a boy.
    And thou shalt have a noble dower:
    And his and my united power                                         210
    Will laugh to scorn the death-firman,
    Which others tremble but to scan,
    And teach the messenger[136] what fate
    The bearer of such boon may wait.
    And now thou know'st thy father's will;
      All that thy sex hath need to know:
    'Twas mine to teach obedience still--
      The way to love, thy Lord may show."

                    VIII.

      In silence bowed the virgin's head;
        And if her eye was filled with tears                            220
      That stifled feeling dare not shed,
      And changed her cheek from pale to red,
        And red to pale, as through her ears
      Those winged words like arrows sped,
        What could such be but maiden fears?
      So bright the tear in Beauty's eye,
      Love half regrets to kiss it dry;
      So sweet the blush of Bashfulness,
      Even Pity scarce can wish it less!

      Whate'er it was the sire forgot:                                  230
      Or if remembered, marked it not;
      Thrice clapped his hands, and called his steed,[137]
        Resigned his gem-adorned chibouque,[138]
      And mounting featly for the mead,
        With Maugrabeel[139] and Mamaluke,
        His way amid his Delis took,[140]
      To witness many an active deed
      With sabre keen, or blunt jerreed.
      The Kislar only and his Moors[141]
      Watch well the Haram's massy doors.                               240

                    IX.

    His head was leant upon his hand,
      His eye looked o'er the dark blue water
    That swiftly glides and gently swells
    Between the winding Dardanelles;
    But yet he saw nor sea nor strand,
    Nor even his Pacha's turbaned band
      Mix in the game of mimic slaughter,
    Careering cleave the folded felt[142]
    With sabre stroke right sharply dealt;
    Nor marked the javelin-darting crowd,                               250
    Nor heard their Ollahs[143] wild and loud--
      He thought but of old Giaffir's daughter!

                    X.

    No word from Selim's bosom broke;
    One sigh Zuleika's thought bespoke:
    Still gazed he through the lattice grate,
    Pale, mute, and mournfully sedate.
    To him Zuleika's eye was turned,
    But little from his aspect learned:
    Equal her grief, yet not the same;
    Her heart confessed a gentler flame:[fp]                            260
    But yet that heart, alarmed or weak,
    She knew not why, forbade to speak.
    Yet speak she must--but when essay?
    "How strange he thus should turn away!
    Not thus we e'er before have met;
    Not thus shall be our parting yet."
    Thrice paced she slowly through the room,
      And watched his eye--it still was fixed:
      She snatched the urn wherein was mixed
    The Persian Atar-gul's perfume,[144]                                270
    And sprinkled all its odours o'er
    The pictured roof[145] and marble floor:
    The drops, that through his glittering vest[fq]
    The playful girl's appeal addressed,
    Unheeded o'er his bosom flew,
    As if that breast were marble too.
    "What, sullen yet? it must not be--
    Oh! gentle Selim, this from thee!"
    She saw in curious order set
      The fairest flowers of Eastern land--                             280
    "He loved them once; may touch them yet,
      If offered by Zuleika's hand."
    The childish thought was hardly breathed
    Before the rose was plucked and wreathed;
    The next fond moment saw her seat
    Her fairy form at Selim's feet:
    "This rose to calm my brother's cares
    A message from the Bulbul[146] bears;
    It says to-night he will prolong
    For Selim's ear his sweetest song;                                  290
    And though his note is somewhat sad,
    He'll try for once a strain more glad,
    With some faint hope his altered lay
    May sing these gloomy thoughts away.

                    XI.

      "What! not receive my foolish flower?
        Nay then I am indeed unblest:
      On me can thus thy forehead lower?
        And know'st thou not who loves thee best?[fr]
      Oh, Selim dear! oh, more than dearest!
      Say, is it me thou hat'st or fearest?                             300
      Come, lay thy head upon my breast,
      And I will kiss thee into rest,
      Since words of mine, and songs must fail,
      Ev'n from my fabled nightingale.
      I knew our sire at times was stern,
      But this from thee had yet to learn:
      Too well I know he loves thee not;
      But is Zuleika's love forgot?
      Ah! deem I right? the Pacha's plan--
      This kinsman Bey of Carasman                                      310
      Perhaps may prove some foe of thine.
      If so, I swear by Mecca's shrine,--[fs]
      If shrines that ne'er approach allow
      To woman's step admit her vow,--
      Without thy free consent--command--
      The Sultan should not have my hand!
      Think'st thou that I could bear to part
      With thee, and learn to halve my heart?
      Ah! were I severed from thy side,
      Where were thy friend--and who my guide?                          320
      Years have not seen, Time shall not see,
      The hour that tears my soul from thee:[ft]
      Ev'n Azrael,[147] from his deadly quiver
        When flies that shaft, and fly it must,[fu]
      That parts all else, shall doom for ever
        Our hearts to undivided dust!"

                    XII.

    He lived--he breathed--he moved--he felt;
    He raised the maid from where she knelt;
    His trance was gone, his keen eye shone
    With thoughts that long in darkness dwelt;                          330
    With thoughts that burn--in rays that melt.
    As the stream late concealed
      By the fringe of its willows,
    When it rushes reveal'd
      In the light of its billows;
    As the bolt bursts on high
      From the black cloud that bound it,
    Flashed the soul of that eye
      Through the long lashes round it.
    A war-horse at the trumpet's sound,                                 340
    A lion roused by heedless hound,
    A tyrant waked to sudden strife
    By graze of ill-directed knife,[fv]
    Starts not to more convulsive life
    Than he, who heard that vow, displayed,
    And all, before repressed, betrayed:
    "Now thou art mine, for ever mine,
    With life to keep, and scarce with life resign;[fw]
    Now thou art mine, that sacred oath,
    Though sworn by one, hath bound us both.                            350
    Yes, fondly, wisely hast thou done;
    That vow hath saved more heads than one:
    But blench not thou--thy simplest tress
    Claims more from me than tenderness;
    I would not wrong the slenderest hair
    That clusters round thy forehead fair,[fx]
    For all the treasures buried far
    Within the caves of Istakar.[148]
    This morning clouds upon me lowered,
    Reproaches on my head were showered,                                360
    And Giaffir almost called me coward!
    Now I have motive to be brave;
    The son of his neglected slave,
    Nay, start not,'twas the term he gave,
    May show, though little apt to vaunt,
    A heart his words nor deeds can daunt.
    _His_ son, indeed!--yet, thanks to thee,
    Perchance I am, at least shall be;
    But let our plighted secret vow
    Be only known to us as now.                                         370
    I know the wretch who dares demand
    From Giaffir thy reluctant hand;
    More ill-got wealth, a meaner soul
    Holds not a Musselim's[149] control;
    Was he not bred in Egripo?[150]
    A viler race let Israel show!
    But let that pass--to none be told
    Our oath; the rest shall time unfold.
    To me and mine leave Osman Bey!
    I've partisans for Peril's day:                                     380
    Think not I am what I appear;
    I've arms--and friends--and vengeance near."

                    XIII.

    "Think not thou art what thou appearest!
      My Selim, thou art sadly changed:
    This morn I saw thee gentlest--dearest--
      But now thou'rt from thyself estranged.
    My love thou surely knew'st before,
    It ne'er was less--nor can be more.
    To see thee--hear thee--near thee stay--
      And hate the night--I know not why,                               390
    Save that we meet not but by day;
      With thee to live, with thee to die,
      I dare not to my hope deny:
    Thy cheek--thine eyes--thy lips to kiss--
    Like this--and this--no more than this;[fy]
    For, Allah! sure thy lips are flame:
      What fever in thy veins is flushing?
    My own have nearly caught the same,
      At least I feel my cheek, too, blushing.
    To soothe thy sickness, watch thy health,                           400
    Partake, but never waste thy wealth,
    Or stand with smiles unmurmuring by,
    And lighten half thy poverty;
    Do all but close thy dying eye,
    For that I could not live to try;
    To these alone my thoughts aspire:
    More can I do? or thou require?
    But, Selim, thou must answer why[fz]
    We need so much of mystery?
    The cause I cannot dream nor tell,                                  410
    But be it, since thou say'st 'tis well;
    Yet what thou mean'st by 'arms' and 'friends,'
    Beyond my weaker sense extends.
    I meant that Giaffir should have heard
      The very vow I plighted thee;
    His wrath would not revoke my word:
      But surely he would leave me free.
      Can this fond wish seem strange in me,
    To be what I have ever been?
    What other hath Zuleika seen                                        420
    From simple childhood's earliest hour?
      What other can she seek to see
    Than thee, companion of her bower,
      The partner of her infancy?
    These cherished thoughts with life begun,
      Say, why must I no more avow?
    What change is wrought to make me shun
      The truth--my pride, and thine till now?
    To meet the gaze of stranger's eyes
    Our law--our creed--our God denies;                                 430
    Nor shall one wandering thought of mine
    At such, our Prophet's will, repine:
    No! happier made by that decree,
    He left me all in leaving thee.
    Deep were my anguish, thus compelled[ga]
    To wed with one I ne'er beheld:
    This wherefore should I not reveal?
    Why wilt thou urge me to conceal?[gb]
    I know the Pacha's haughty mood
    To thee hath never boded good;                                      440
    And he so often storms at nought,
    Allah! forbid that e'er he ought!
    And why I know not, but within
    My heart concealment weighs like sin.[gc]
    If then such secrecy be crime,
      And such it feels while lurking here;
    Oh, Selim! tell me yet in time,
      Nor leave me thus to thoughts of fear.
    Ah! yonder see the Tchocadar,[151]
    My father leaves the mimic war;                                     450
    I tremble now to meet his eye--
    Say, Selim, canst thou tell me why?"

                    XIV.

    "Zuleika--to thy tower's retreat
    Betake thee--Giaffir I can greet:
    And now with him I fain must prate
    Of firmans, imposts, levies, state.
    There's fearful news from Danube's banks,
    Our Vizier nobly thins his ranks
    For which the Giaour may give him thanks!
    Our Sultan hath a shorter way                                       460
    Such costly triumph to repay.
    But, mark me, when the twilight drum
      Hath warned the troops to food and sleep,
    Unto thy cell with Selim come;
      Then softly from the Haram creep
      Where we may wander by the deep:
      Our garden battlements are steep;
    Nor these will rash intruder climb
    To list our words, or stint our time;
    And if he doth, I want not steel                                    470
    Which some have felt, and more may feel.
    Then shalt thou learn of Selim more
    Than thou hast heard or thought before:
    Trust me, Zuleika--fear not me!
    Thou know'st I hold a Haram key."

    "Fear thee, my Selim! ne'er till now
    Did words like this----"

                            "Delay not thou;[gd]
    I keep the key--and Haroun's guard
    Have _some_, and hope of _more_ reward.
    To-night, Zuleika, thou shalt hear                                  480
    My tale, my purpose, and my fear:
    I am not, love! what I appear."



                   CANTO THE SECOND.[ge]

                    I.

    The winds are high on Helle's wave,
      As on that night of stormy water
    When Love, who sent, forgot to save
    The young--the beautiful--the brave--
      The lonely hope of Sestos' daughter.
    Oh! when alone along the sky
    Her turret-torch was blazing high,
    Though rising gale, and breaking foam,                              490
    And shrieking sea-birds warned him home;
    And clouds aloft and tides below,
    With signs and sounds, forbade to go,
    He could not see, he would not hear,
    Or sound or sign foreboding fear;
    His eye but saw that light of Love,
    The only star it hailed above;
    His ear but rang with Hero's song,
    "Ye waves, divide not lovers long!"--
    That tale is old, but Love anew[152]                                500
    May nerve young hearts to prove as true.

                    II.

    The winds are high and Helle's tide
      Rolls darkly heaving to the main;
    And Night's descending shadows hide
      That field with blood bedewed in vain,
    The desert of old Priam's pride;
      The tombs, sole relics of his reign,
    All--save immortal dreams that could beguile
    The blind old man of Scio's rocky isle!

                    III.

    Oh! yet--for there my steps have been;                              510
      These feet have pressed the sacred shore,
    These limbs that buoyant wave hath borne--
    Minstrel! with thee to muse, to mourn,
      To trace again those fields of yore,
    Believing every hillock green
      Contains no fabled hero's ashes,
    And that around the undoubted scene
      Thine own "broad Hellespont"[153] still dashes,
    Be long my lot! and cold were he
    Who there could gaze denying thee!                                  520

                    IV.

    The Night hath closed on Helle's stream,
      Nor yet hath risen on Ida's hill
    That Moon, which shone on his high theme:
    No warrior chides her peaceful beam,
      But conscious shepherds bless it still.
    Their flocks are grazing on the Mound
      Of him who felt the Dardan's arrow:
    That mighty heap of gathered ground
    Which Ammon's son ran proudly round,[154]
    By nations raised, by monarchs crowned,                             530
      Is now a lone and nameless barrow!
    Within--thy dwelling-place how narrow![155]
    Without--can only strangers breathe
    The name of him that _was_ beneath:
    Dust long outlasts the storied stone;
    But Thou--thy very dust is gone!

                    V.

    Late, late to-night will Dian cheer
    The swain, and chase the boatman's fear;
    Till then--no beacon on the cliff
    May shape the course of struggling skiff;                           540
    The scattered lights that skirt the bay,
    All, one by one, have died away;
    The only lamp of this lone hour
    Is glimmering in Zuleika's tower.
    Yes! there is light in that lone chamber,
      And o'er her silken ottoman
    Are thrown the fragrant beads of amber,
      O'er which her fairy fingers ran;[156]
    Near these, with emerald rays beset,[157]
    (How could she thus that gem forget?)                               550
    Her mother's sainted amulet,[158]
    Whereon engraved the Koorsee text,
    Could smooth this life, and win the next;
    And by her Comboloio[159] lies
    A Koran of illumined dyes;
    And many a bright emblazoned rhyme
    By Persian scribes redeemed from Time;
    And o'er those scrolls, not oft so mute,
    Reclines her now neglected lute;
    And round her lamp of fretted gold                                  560
    Bloom flowers in urns of China's mould;
    The richest work of Iran's loom,
    And Sheeraz[160] tribute of perfume;

    All that can eye or sense delight
      Are gathered in that gorgeous room:
      But yet it hath an air of gloom.
    She, of this Peri cell the sprite,
    What doth she hence, and on so rude a night?

                    VI.

    Wrapt in the darkest sable vest,
      Which none save noblest Moslem wear,                              570
    To guard from winds of Heaven the breast
      As Heaven itself to Selim dear,
    With cautious steps the thicket threading,
      And starting oft, as through the glade
      The gust its hollow moanings made,
    Till on the smoother pathway treading,
    More free her timid bosom beat,
      The maid pursued her silent guide;
    And though her terror urged retreat,
      How could she quit her Selim's side?                              580
      How teach her tender lips to chide?

                    VII.

    They reached at length a grotto, hewn
      By nature, but enlarged by art,
    Where oft her lute she wont to tune,
      And oft her Koran conned apart;
    And oft in youthful reverie
    She dreamed what Paradise might be:
    Where Woman's parted soul shall go
    Her Prophet had disdained to show;[gf][161]
    But Selim's mansion was secure,                                     590
    Nor deemed she, could he long endure
    His bower in other worlds of bliss
    Without _her_, most beloved in this!
    Oh! who so dear with him could dwell?
    What Houri soothe him half so well?

                    VIII.

    Since last she visited the spot
    Some change seemed wrought within the grot:
    It might be only that the night
    Disguised things seen by better light:
    That brazen lamp but dimly threw                                    600
    A ray of no celestial hue;
    But in a nook within the cell
    Her eye on stranger objects fell.
    There arms were piled, not such as wield
    The turbaned Delis in the field;
    But brands of foreign blade and hilt,
    And one was red--perchance with guilt![gg]
    Ah! how without can blood be spilt?
    A cup too on the board was set
    That did not seem to hold sherbet.                                  610
    What may this mean? she turned to see
    Her Selim--"Oh! can this be he?"[gh]

                    IX.

    His robe of pride was thrown aside,
      His brow no high-crowned turban bore,
    But in its stead a shawl of red,
      Wreathed lightly round, his temples wore:
    That dagger, on whose hilt the gem
    Were worthy of a diadem,
    No longer glittered at his waist,
    Where pistols unadorned were braced;                                620
    And from his belt a sabre swung,
    And from his shoulder loosely hung
    The cloak of white, the thin capote
    That decks the wandering Candiote;
    Beneath--his golden plated vest
    Clung like a cuirass to his breast;
    The greaves below his knee that wound
    With silvery scales were sheathed and bound.
    But were it not that high command
    Spake in his eye, and tone, and hand,                               630
    All that a careless eye could see
    In him was some young Galiongee.[162]

                    X.

    "I said I was not what I seemed;
      And now thou see'st my words were true:
    I have a tale thou hast not dreamed,
      If sooth--its truth must others rue.
    My story now 'twere vain to hide,
    I must not see thee Osman's bride:
    But had not thine own lips declared
    How much of that young heart I shared,                              640
    I could not, must not, yet have shown
    The darker secret of my own.
    In this I speak not now of love;
    That--let Time--Truth--and Peril prove:
    But first--Oh! never wed another--
    Zuleika! I am not thy brother!"

                    XI.

    "Oh! not my brother!--yet unsay--
      God! am I left alone on earth
    To mourn--I dare not curse--the day[gi]
      That saw my solitary birth?                                       650
    Oh! thou wilt love me now no more!
      My sinking heart foreboded ill;
    But know _me_ all I was before,
      Thy sister--friend--Zuleika still.
    Thou led'st me here perchance to kill;
      If thou hast cause for vengeance, see!
    My breast is offered--take thy fill!
      Far better with the dead to be
      Than live thus nothing now to thee:
    Perhaps far worse, for now I know                                   660
    Why Giaffir always seemed thy foe;
    And I, alas! am Giaffir's child,
    For whom thou wert contemned, reviled.
    If not thy sister--would'st thou save
    My life--Oh! bid me be thy slave!"

                    XII.

    "My slave, Zuleika!--nay, I'm thine:
      But, gentle love, this transport calm,
    Thy lot shall yet be linked with mine;
    I swear it by our Prophet's shrine,[gj]
      And be that thought thy sorrow's balm.                            670
    So may the Koran[163] verse displayed
    Upon its steel direct my blade,
    In danger's hour to guard us both,
    As I preserve that awful oath!
    The name in which thy heart hath prided
      Must change; but, my Zuleika, know,
    That tie is widened, not divided,
      Although thy Sire's my deadliest foe.
    My father was to Giaffir all
      That Selim late was deemed to thee;                               680
    That brother wrought a brother's fall,
      But spared, at least, my infancy!
    And lulled me with a vain deceit
    That yet a like return may meet.
    He reared me, not with tender help,
      But like the nephew of a Cain;[164]
    He watched me like a lion's whelp,
      That gnaws and yet may break his chain.
      My father's blood in every vein
    Is boiling! but for thy dear sake                                   690
    No present vengeance will I take;
      Though here I must no more remain.
    But first, beloved Zuleika! hear
    How Giaffir wrought this deed of fear.

                    XIII.

    "How first their strife to rancour grew,
      If Love or Envy made them foes,
    It matters little if I knew;
    In fiery spirits, slights, though few
      And thoughtless, will disturb repose.
    In war Abdallah's arm was strong,                                   700
      Remembered yet in Bosniac song,[165]
    And Paswan's[166] rebel hordes attest
    How little love they bore such guest:
    His death is all I need relate,
    The stern effect of Giaffir's hate;
    And how my birth disclosed to me,[gk]
    Whate'er beside it makes, hath made me free.

                    XIV.

    "When Paswan, after years of strife,
    At last for power, but first for life,
    In Widdin's walls too proudly sate,                                 710
    Our Pachas rallied round the state;
    Not last nor least in high command,
    Each brother led a separate band;
    They gave their Horse-tails[167] to the wind,
      And mustering in Sophia's plain
    Their tents were pitched, their post assigned;
      To one, alas! assigned in vain!
    What need of words? the deadly bowl,
      By Giaffir's order drugged and given,
    With venom subtle as his soul,[gl]
      Dismissed Abdallah's hence to heaven.                             720
    Reclined and feverish in the bath,
    He, when the hunter's sport was up,
    But little deemed a brother's wrath
      To quench his thirst had such a cup:
    The bowl a bribed attendant bore;
    He drank one draught,[168] nor needed more!
    If thou my tale, Zuleika, doubt,
    Call Haroun--he can tell it out.

                    XV.

    "The deed once done, and Paswan's feud                              730
    In part suppressed, though ne'er subdued,
      Abdallah's Pachalick was gained:--
    Thou know'st not what in our Divan
    Can wealth procure for worse than man--
      Abdallah's honours were obtained
    By him a brother's murder stained;
    'Tis true, the purchase nearly drained
    His ill-got treasure, soon replaced.
    Would'st question whence? Survey the waste,
    And ask the squalid peasant how                                     740
    His gains repay his broiling brow!--
    Why me the stern Usurper spared,
    Why thus with me his palace spared,
    I know not. Shame--regret--remorse--
    And little fear from infant's force--
    Besides, adoption as a son
    By him whom Heaven accorded none,
    Or some unknown cabal, caprice,
    Preserved me thus:--but not in peace:
    He cannot curb his haughty mood,[gm]                                750
    Nor I forgive a father's blood.

                    XVI.

    "Within thy Father's house are foes;
      Not all who break his bread are true:
    To these should I my birth disclose,
      His days-his very hours were few:
    They only want a heart to lead,
    A hand to point them to the deed.
    But Haroun only knows, or knew
      This tale, whose close is almost nigh:
    He in Abdallah's palace grew,                                       760
      And held that post in his Serai
      Which holds he here--he saw him die;
    But what could single slavery do?
    Avenge his lord? alas! too late;
    Or save his son from such a fate?
    He chose the last, and when elate
      With foes subdued, or friends betrayed,
    Proud Giaffir in high triumph sate,
    He led me helpless to his gate,
      And not in vain it seems essayed                                  770
      To save the life for which he prayed.
    The knowledge of my birth secured
      From all and each, but most from me;
    Thus Giaffir's safety was ensured.
      Removed he too from Roumelie
    To this our Asiatic side,
    Far from our seats by Danube's tide,
      With none but Haroun, who retains
    Such knowledge--and that Nubian feels
      A Tyrant's secrets are but chains,                                780
    From which the captive gladly steals,
    And this and more to me reveals:
    Such still to guilt just Allah sends--
    Slaves, tools, accomplices--no friends!

                    XVII.

    "All this, Zuleika, harshly sounds;
      But harsher still my tale must be:
    Howe'er my tongue thy softness wounds,
      Yet I must prove all truth to thee."[gn]
      I saw thee start this garb to see,
    Yet is it one I oft have worn,                                      790
      And long must wear: this Galiongee,
    To whom thy plighted vow is sworn,
      Is leader of those pirate hordes,
      Whose laws and lives are on their swords;
    To hear whose desolating tale
    Would make thy waning cheek more pale:
    Those arms thou see'st my band have brought,
    The hands that wield are not remote;
    This cup too for the rugged knaves
      Is filled--once quaffed, they ne'er repine:                       800
    Our Prophet might forgive the slaves;
      They're only infidels in wine.

                    XVIII.

    "What could I be? Proscribed at home,
    And taunted to a wish to roam;
    And listless left--for Giaffir's fear
    Denied the courser and the spear--
    Though oft--Oh, Mahomet! how oft!--
    In full Divan the despot scoffed,
    As if _my_ weak unwilling hand
    Refused the bridle or the brand:                                    810
    He ever went to war alone,
    And pent me here untried--unknown;
    To Haroun's care with women left,[go]
    By hope unblest, of fame bereft,
    While thou--whose softness long endeared,
    Though it unmanned me, still had cheered--
    To Brusa's walls for safety sent,
    Awaited'st there the field's event.
    Haroun who saw my spirit pining[gp]
      Beneath inaction's sluggish yoke,                                 820
    His captive, though with dread resigning,
      My thraldom for a season broke,
    On promise to return before
    The day when Giaffir's charge was o'er.
    'Tis vain--my tongue can not impart[gq]
    My almost drunkenness of heart,[169]
    When first this liberated eye
    Surveyed Earth--Ocean--Sun--and Sky--
    As if my Spirit pierced them through,
    And all their inmost wonders knew!                                  830
    One word alone can paint to thee
    That more than feeling--I was Free!
    E'en for thy presence ceased to pine;
    The World--nay, Heaven itself was mine!

                    XIX.

    "The shallop of a trusty Moor
    Conveyed me from this idle shore;
    I longed to see the isles that gem
    Old Ocean's purple diadem:
    I sought by turns, and saw them all;[170]
      But when and where I joined the crew,                             840
    With whom I'm pledged to rise or fall,
      When all that we design to do
    Is done,'twill then be time more meet
    To tell thee, when the tale's complete.

                    XX.

    "'Tis true, they are a lawless brood,
    But rough in form, nor mild in mood;
    And every creed, and every race,
    With them hath found--may find a place:
    But open speech, and ready hand,
    Obedience to their Chief's command;                                 850
    A soul for every enterprise,
    That never sees with Terror's eyes;
    Friendship for each, and faith to all,
    And vengeance vowed for those who fall,
    Have made them fitting instruments
    For more than e'en my own intents.
    And some--and I have studied all
      Distinguished from the vulgar rank,
    But chiefly to my council call
      The wisdom of the cautious Frank:--                               860
    And some to higher thoughts aspire.
      The last of Lambro's[171] patriots there
      Anticipated freedom share;
    And oft around the cavern fire
    On visionary schemes debate,
    To snatch the Rayahs[172] from their fate.
    So let them ease their hearts with prate
    Of equal rights, which man ne'er knew;
    I have a love for freedom too.
    Aye! let me like the ocean-Patriarch[173] roam,                     870
    Or only know on land the Tartar's home![174]
    My tent on shore, my galley on the sea,
    Are more than cities and Serais to me:[175]
    Borne by my steed, or wafted by my sail,
    Across the desert, or before the gale,
    Bound where thou wilt, my barb! or glide, my prow!
    But be the Star that guides the wanderer, Thou!
    Thou, my Zuleika, share and bless my bark;
    The Dove of peace and promise to mine ark![176]
    Or, since that hope denied in worlds of strife,                     880
    Be thou the rainbow to the storms of life!
    The evening beam that smiles the clouds away,
    And tints to-morrow with prophetic ray![177]
    Blest--as the Muezzin's strain from Mecca's wall
    To pilgrims pure and prostrate at his call;
    Soft--as the melody of youthful days,
    That steals the trembling tear of speechless praise;
    Dear--as his native song to Exile's ears,[gr]
    Shall sound each tone thy long-loved voice endears.
    For thee in those bright isles is built a bower                     890
    Blooming as Aden[178] in its earliest hour.
    A thousand swords, with Selim's heart and hand,
    Wait--wave--defend--destroy--at thy command![gs]
    Girt by my band, Zuleika at my side,
    The spoil of nations shall bedeck my bride.
    The Haram's languid years of listless ease
    Are well resigned for cares--for joys like these:
    Not blind to Fate, I see, where'er I rove,
    Unnumbered perils,--but one only love!
    Yet well my toils shall that fond breast repay,                     900
    Though Fortune frown, or falser friends betray.
    How dear the dream in darkest hours of ill,
    Should all be changed, to find thee faithful still!
    Be but thy soul, like Selim's firmly shown;
    To thee be Selim's tender as thine own;
    To soothe each sorrow, share in each delight,[gt]
    Blend every thought, do all--but disunite!
    Once free, 'tis mine our horde again to guide;
    Friends to each other, foes to aught beside:[179]
    Yet there we follow but the bent assigned                           910
    By fatal Nature to man's warring kind:[gu]
    Mark! where his carnage and his conquests cease!
    He makes a solitude, and calls it--peace![gv][180]
    I like the rest must use my skill or strength,
    But ask no land beyond my sabre's length:
    Power sways but by division--her resource[gw]
    The blest alternative of fraud or force!
    Ours be the last; in time Deceit may come
    When cities cage us in a social home:
    There ev'n thy soul might err--how oft the heart                    920
    Corruption shakes which Peril could not part!
    And Woman, more than Man, when Death or Woe,
    Or even Disgrace, would lay her lover low,
    Sunk in the lap of Luxury will shame--
    Away suspicion!--_not_ Zuleika's name!
    But life is hazard at the best; and here
    No more remains to win, and much to fear:
    Yes, fear!--the doubt, the dread of losing thee,
    By Osman's power, and Giaffir's stern decree.
    That dread shall vanish with the favouring gale,                    930
    Which Love to-night hath promised to my sail:[gx]
    No danger daunts the pair his smile hath blest,
    Their steps still roving, but their hearts at rest.
    With thee all toils are sweet, each clime hath charms;
    Earth--sea alike--our world within our arms!
    Aye--let the loud winds whistle o'er the deck,[181]
    So that those arms cling closer round my neck:
    The deepest murmur of this lip shall be,[gy][182]
    No sigh for safety, but a prayer for thee!
    The war of elements no fears impart                                 940
    To Love, whose deadliest bane is human Art:
    _There_ lie the only rocks our course can check;
    _Here_ moments menace--_there_ are years of wreck!
    But hence ye thoughts that rise in Horror's shape!
    This hour bestows, or ever bars escape.[gz]
    Few words remain of mine my tale to close;
    Of thine but _one_ to waft us from our foes;
    Yea--foes--to me will Giaffir's hate decline?
    And is not Osman, who would part us, thine?

                    XXI.

    "His head and faith from doubt and death                            950
      Returned in time my guard to save;
      Few heard, none told, that o'er the wave
    From isle to isle I roved the while:
    And since, though parted from my band
    Too seldom now I leave the land,
    No deed they've done, nor deed shall do,
    Ere I have heard and doomed it too:
    I form the plan--decree the spoil--
    Tis fit I oftener share the toil.
    But now too long I've held thine ear;                               960
    Time presses--floats my bark--and here
    We leave behind but hate and fear.
    To-morrow Osman with his train
    Arrives--to-night must break thy chain:
    And would'st thou save that haughty Bey,--
      Perchance _his_ life who gave thee thine,--
    With me this hour away--away!
      But yet, though thou art plighted mine,
    Would'st thou recall thy willing vow,
    Appalled by truths imparted now,                                    970
    Here rest I--not to see thee wed:
    But be that peril on _my_ head!"

                    XXII.

    Zuleika, mute and motionless,
    Stood like that Statue of Distress,
    When, her last hope for ever gone,
    The Mother hardened into stone;
    All in the maid that eye could see
    Was but a younger Niobe.
    But ere her lip, or even her eye,
    Essayed to speak, or look reply,                                    980
    Beneath the garden's wicket porch
    Far flashed on high a blazing torch!
    Another--and another--and another--[183]
    "Oh! fly--no more--yet now my more than brother!"
    Far, wide, through every thicket spread
    The fearful lights are gleaming red;
    Nor these alone--for each right hand
    Is ready with a sheathless brand.
    They part--pursue--return, and wheel
    With searching flambeau, shining steel;                             990
    And last of all, his sabre waving,
    Stern Giaffir in his fury raving:
    And now almost they touch the cave--
    Oh! must that grot be Selim's grave?

                    XXIII.

    Dauntless he stood--"'Tis come--soon past--
    One kiss, Zuleika--'tis my last:
      But yet my band not far from shore
    May hear this signal, see the flash;
    Yet now too few--the attempt were rash:
      No matter--yet one effort more."                                 1000
    Forth to the cavern mouth he stept;
      His pistol's echo rang on high,
    Zuleika started not, nor wept,
      Despair benumbed her breast and eye!--
    "They hear me not, or if they ply
    Their oars,'tis but to see me die;
    That sound hath drawn my foes more nigh.
    Then forth my father's scimitar,
    Thou ne'er hast seen less equal war!
    Farewell, Zuleika!--Sweet! retire:                                 1010
      Yet stay within--here linger safe,
      At thee his rage will only chafe.
    Stir not--lest even to thee perchance
    Some erring blade or ball should glance.
    Fear'st them for him?--may I expire
    If in this strife I seek thy sire!
    No--though by him that poison poured;
    No--though again he call me coward!
    But tamely shall I meet their steel?
    No--as each crest save _his_ may feel!"                            1020

                    XXIV.

    One bound he made, and gained the sand:
      Already at his feet hath sunk
    The foremost of the prying band,
      A gasping head, a quivering trunk:
    Another falls--but round him close
    A swarming circle of his foes;
    From right to left his path he cleft,
      And almost met the meeting wave:
    His boat appears--not five oars' length--
    His comrades strain with desperate strength--                      1030
      Oh! are they yet in time to save?
      His feet the foremost breakers lave;
    His band are plunging in the bay,
    Their sabres glitter through the spray;
    Wet--wild--unwearied to the strand
    They struggle--now they touch the land!
    They come--'tis but to add to slaughter--
    His heart's best blood is on the water.

                    XXV.

    Escaped from shot, unharmed by steel,
    Or scarcely grazed its force to feel,[ha]                          1040
    Had Selim won, betrayed, beset,
    To where the strand and billows met;
    There as his last step left the land,
    And the last death-blow dealt his hand--
    Ah! wherefore did he turn to look[hb]
      For her his eye but sought in vain?
    That pause, that fatal gaze he took,
      Hath doomed his death, or fixed his chain.
    Sad proof, in peril and in pain,
    How late will Lover's hope remain!                                 1050
    His back was to the dashing spray;
    Behind, but close, his comrades lay,
    When, at the instant, hissed the ball--
    "So may the foes of Giaffir fall!"
    Whose voice is heard? whose carbine rang?
    Whose bullet through the night-air sang,
    Too nearly, deadly aimed to err?
    'Tis thine--Abdallah's Murderer!
    The father slowly rued thy hate,
    The son hath found a quicker fate:                                 1060
    Fast from his breast the blood is bubbling,
    The whiteness of the sea-foam troubling--
    If aught his lips essayed to groan,
    The rushing billows choked the tone!

                    XXVI.

    Morn slowly rolls the clouds away;
      Few trophies of the fight are there:
    The shouts that shook the midnight-bay
    Are silent; but some signs of fray
      That strand of strife may bear,
    And fragments of each shivered brand;                              1070
    Steps stamped; and dashed into the sand
    The print of many a struggling hand
      May there be marked; nor far remote
      A broken torch, an oarless boat;
    And tangled on the weeds that heap
    The beach where shelving to the deep
      There lies a white capote!
    'Tis rent in twain--one dark-red stain
    The wave yet ripples o'er in vain:
      But where is he who wore?                                        1080
    Ye! who would o'er his relics weep,
    Go, seek them where the surges sweep
    Their burthen round Sigaeum's steep
      And cast on Lemnos' shore:
    The sea-birds shriek above the prey,
    O'er which their hungry beaks delay,[hc]
    As shaken on his restless pillow,
    His head heaves with the heaving billow;
    That hand, whose motion is not life,[hd]
    Yet feebly seems to menace strife,                                 1090
    Flung by the tossing tide on high,
      Then levelled with the wave--[184]
    What recks it, though that corse shall lie
      Within a living grave?
    The bird that tears that prostrate form
    Hath only robbed the meaner worm;
    The only heart, the only eye
    Had bled or wept to see him die,
    Had seen those scattered limbs composed,
      And mourned above his turban-stone,[185]                         1100
    That heart hath burst--that eye was closed--
      Yea--closed before his own!

                    XXVII.

    By Helle's stream there is a voice of wail!
    And Woman's eye is wet--Man's cheek is pale:
    Zuleika! last of Giaffir's race,
      Thy destined lord is come too late:
    He sees not--ne'er shall see thy face!
          Can he not hear
    The loud Wul-wulleh[186] warn his distant ear?
      Thy handmaids weeping at the gate,                               1110
      The Koran-chanters of the Hymn of Fate,[he][187]
      The silent slaves with folded arms that wait,
    Sighs in the hall, and shrieks upon the gale,
          Tell him thy tale!
    Thou didst not view thy Selim fall!
      That fearful moment when he left the cave
          Thy heart grew chill:
      He was thy hope--thy joy--thy love--thine all,
      And that last thought on him thou could'st not save
            Sufficed to kill;                                          1120
    Burst forth in one wild cry--and all was still.
      Peace to thy broken heart--and virgin grave!
    Ah! happy! but of life to lose the worst!
    That grief--though deep--though fatal--was thy first!
    Thrice happy! ne'er to feel nor fear the force
    Of absence--shame--pride--hate--revenge--remorse!
    And, oh! that pang where more than Madness lies
    The Worm that will not sleep--and never dies;
    Thought of the gloomy day and ghastly night,
    That dreads the darkness, and yet loathes the light,               1130
    That winds around, and tears the quivering heart!
    Ah! wherefore not consume it--and depart!
    Woe to thee, rash and unrelenting Chief!
      Vainly thou heap'st the dust upon thy head,
      Vainly the sackcloth o'er thy limbs dost spread:[188]
      By that same hand Abdallah--Selim bled.
    Now let it tear thy beard in idle grief:
    Thy pride of heart, thy bride for Osman's bed,
    She, whom thy Sultan had but seen to wed,[hf]
          Thy Daughter's dead!                                         1140
      Hope of thine age, thy twilight's lonely beam,
      The Star hath set that shone on Helle's stream.
    What quenched its ray?--the blood that thou hast shed!
    Hark! to the hurried question of Despair:[189]
    "Where is my child?"--an Echo answers--"Where?"[190]

                    XXVIII.

    Within the place of thousand tombs
      That shine beneath, while dark above
    The sad but living cypress glooms[hg]
      And withers not, though branch and leaf
    Are stamped with an eternal grief,                                 1150
      Like early unrequited Love,
    One spot exists, which ever blooms,
      Ev'n in that deadly grove--
    A single rose is shedding there
      Its lonely lustre, meek and pale:
    It looks as planted by Despair--
      So white--so faint--the slightest gale
    Might whirl the leaves on high;
      And yet, though storms and blight assail,
    And hands more rude than wintry sky                                1160
      May wring it from the stem--in vain--
      To-morrow sees it bloom again!
    The stalk some Spirit gently rears,
    And waters with celestial tears;
      For well may maids of Helle deem
    That this can be no earthly flower,
    Which mocks the tempest's withering hour,
    And buds unsheltered by a bower;
    Nor droops, though Spring refuse her shower,
      Nor woos the Summer beam:                                        1170
    To it the livelong night there sings
      A Bird unseen--but not remote:
    Invisible his airy wings,
    But soft as harp that Houri strings
      His long entrancing note!
    It were the Bulbul; but his throat,
      Though mournful, pours not such a strain:
    For they who listen cannot leave
    The spot, but linger there and grieve,
      As if they loved in vain!                                        1180
    And yet so sweet the tears they shed,
    'Tis sorrow so unmixed with dread,
    They scarce can bear the morn to break
      That melancholy spell,
    And longer yet would weep and wake,
      He sings so wild and well!
    But when the day-blush bursts from high[hh]
      Expires that magic melody.
    And some have been who could believe,[hi]
    (So fondly youthful dreams deceive,                                1190
      Yet harsh be they that blame,)
    That note so piercing and profound
    Will shape and syllable[191] its sound
      Into Zuleika's name.
    'Tis from her cypress summit heard,
    That melts in air the liquid word:
    'Tis from her lowly virgin earth
    That white rose takes its tender birth.
    There late was laid a marble stone;
    Eve saw it placed--the Morrow gone!                                1200
    It was no mortal arm that bore
    That deep fixed pillar to the shore;
    For there, as Helle's legends tell,
    Next morn 'twas found where Selim fell;
    Lashed by the tumbling tide, whose wave
    Denied his bones a holier grave:
    And there by night, reclined, 'tis said.
    Is seen a ghastly turbaned head:[192]
      And hence extended by the billow,
      'Tis named the "Pirate-phantom's pillow!"                        1210
      Where first it lay that mourning flower
      Hath flourished; flourisheth this hour,
    Alone and dewy--coldly pure and pale;
    As weeping Beauty's cheek at Sorrow's tale![hj][193]





                            THE CORSAIR.[197]



                      CANTO THE FIRST.

    "----nessun maggior dolore,
    Che ricordarsi del tempo felice
    Nella miseria,----"
                                                 Dante, _Inferno_, v. 121.

                    I.

    "O'er the glad waters of the dark blue sea,
    Our thoughts as boundless, and our souls as free,
    Far as the breeze can bear, the billows foam,
    Survey our empire, and behold our home![198]
    These are our realms, no limits to their sway--
    Our flag the sceptre all who meet obey.
    Ours the wild life in tumult still to range
    From toil to rest, and joy in every change.
    Oh, who can tell? not thou, luxurious slave!
    Whose soul would sicken o'er the heaving wave;                       10
    Not thou, vain lord of Wantonness and Ease!	
    Whom Slumber soothes not--Pleasure cannot please--
    Oh, who can tell, save he whose heart hath tried,
    And danced in triumph o'er the waters wide,
    The exulting sense--the pulse's maddening play,
    That thrills the wanderer of that trackless way?
    That for itself can woo the approaching fight,
    And turn what some deem danger to delight;
    That seeks what cravens shun with more than zeal,
    And where the feebler faint can only feel--                          20
    Feel--to the rising bosom's inmost core,
    Its hope awaken and its spirit soar?
    No dread of Death--if with us die our foes--
    Save that it seems even duller than repose;
    Come when it will--we snatch the life of Life--
    When lost--what recks it by disease or strife?
    Let him who crawls, enamoured of decay,
    Cling to his couch, and sicken years away;[hk]
    Heave his thick breath, and shake his palsied head;
    Ours the fresh turf, and not the feverish bed,--                     30
    While gasp by gasp he falters forth his soul,
    Ours with one pang--one bound--escapes control.
    His corse may boast its urn and narrow cave,
    And they who loathed his life may gild his grave:
    Ours are the tears, though few, sincerely shed,
    When Ocean shrouds and sepulchres our dead.
    For us, even banquets fond regret supply
    In the red cup that crowns our memory;
    And the brief epitaph in Danger's day,
    When those who win at length divide the prey,                        40
    And cry, Remembrance saddening o'er each brow,
    How had the brave who fell exulted _now_!"

                    II.

    Such were the notes that from the Pirate's isle
    Around the kindling watch-fire rang the while:
    Such were the sounds that thrilled the rocks along,
    And unto ears as rugged seemed a song!
    In scattered groups upon the golden sand,
    They game--carouse--converse--or whet the brand;
    Select the arms--to each his blade assign,
    And careless eye the blood that dims its shine;                      50
    Repair the boat, replace the helm or oar,
    While others straggling muse along the shore;
    For the wild bird the busy springes set,
    Or spread beneath the sun the dripping net:
    Gaze where some distant sail a speck supplies,
    With all the thirsting eye of Enterprise;
    Tell o'er the tales of many a night of toil,
    And marvel where they next shall seize a spoil:
    No matter where--their chief's allotment this;
    Theirs to believe no prey nor plan amiss.                            60
    But who that Chief? his name on every shore
    Is famed and feared--they ask and know no more
    With these he mingles not but to command;
    Few are his words, but keen his eye and hand.
    Ne'er seasons he with mirth their jovial mess,
    But they forgive his silence for success.
    Ne'er for his lip the purpling cup they fill,
    That goblet passes him untasted still--
    And for his fare--the rudest of his crew
    Would that, in turn, have passed untasted too;                       70
    Earth's coarsest bread, the garden's homeliest roots,
    And scarce the summer luxury of fruits,
    His short repast in humbleness supply
    With all a hermit's board would scarce deny.
    But while he shuns the grosser joys of sense,
    His mind seems nourished by that abstinence.
    "Steer to that shore!"--they sail. "Do this!"--'tis done:
    "Now form and follow me!"--the spoil is won.
    Thus prompt his accents and his actions still,
    And all obey and few inquire his will;                               80
    To such, brief answer and contemptuous eye
    Convey reproof, nor further deign reply.

                    III.

    "A sail!--a sail!"--a promised prize to Hope!
    Her nation--flag--how speaks the telescope?[hl]
    No prize, alas! but yet a welcome sail:
    The blood-red signal glitters in the gale.
    Yes--she is ours--a home-returning bark--
    Blow fair, thou breeze!--she anchors ere the dark.
    Already doubled is the cape--our bay
    Receives that prow which proudly spurns the spray.                   90
    How gloriously her gallant course she goes!
    Her white wings flying--never from her foes--
    She walks the waters like a thing of Life![199]
    And seems to dare the elements to strife.
    Who would not brave the battle-fire, the wreck,
    To move the monarch of her peopled deck!

                    IV.

    Hoarse o'er her side the rustling cable rings:
    The sails are furled; and anchoring round she swings;
    And gathering loiterers on the land discern
    Her boat descending from the latticed stern.                        100
    'Tis manned--the oars keep concert to the strand,
    Till grates her keel upon the shallow sand.[hm]
    Hail to the welcome shout!--the friendly speech!
    When hand grasps hand uniting on the beach;
    The smile, the question, and the quick reply,
    And the Heart's promise of festivity!

                    V.

    The tidings spread, and gathering grows the crowd:
    The hum of voices, and the laughter loud,
    And Woman's gentler anxious tone is heard--
    Friends'--husbands'--lovers' names in each dear word:               110
    "Oh! are they safe? we ask not of success--
    But shall we see them? will their accents bless?
    From where the battle roars, the billows chafe,
    They doubtless boldly did--but who are safe?
    Here let them haste to gladden and surprise,
    And kiss the doubt from these delighted eyes!"

                    VI.

    "Where is our Chief? for him we bear report--
    And doubt that joy--which hails our coming--short;
    Yet thus sincere--'tis cheering, though so brief;
    But, Juan! instant guide us to our Chief:                           120
    Our greeting paid, we'll feast on our return,
    And all shall hear what each may wish to learn."
    Ascending slowly by the rock-hewn way,
    To where his watch-tower beetles o'er the bay,
    By bushy brake, the wild flowers blossoming,
    And freshness breathing from each silver spring,
    Whose scattered streams from granite basins burst,
    Leap into life, and sparkling woo your thirst;
    From crag to cliff they mount--Near yonder cave,
    What lonely straggler looks along the wave?                         130
    In pensive posture leaning on the brand,
    Not oft a resting-staff to that red hand?
    "'Tis he--'tis Conrad--here--as wont--alone;
    On--Juan!--on--and make our purpose known.
    The bark he views--and tell him we would greet
    His ear with tidings he must quickly meet:
    We dare not yet approach--thou know'st his mood,
    When strange or uninvited steps intrude."

                    VII.

    Him Juan sought, and told of their intent;--
    He spake not, but a sign expressed assent,                          140
    These Juan calls--they come--to their salute
    He bends him slightly, but his lips are mute.
    "These letters, Chief, are from the Greek--the spy,
    Who still proclaims our spoil or peril nigh:
    Whate'er his tidings, we can well report,
    Much that"--"Peace, peace!"--he cuts their prating short.
    Wondering they turn, abashed, while each to each
    Conjecture whispers in his muttering speech:
    They watch his glance with many a stealing look,
    To gather how that eye the tidings took;                            150
    But, this as if he guessed, with head aside,
    Perchance from some emotion, doubt, or pride,
    He read the scroll--"My tablets, Juan, hark--
    Where is Gonsalvo?"

                         "In the anchored bark."
    "There let him stay--to him this order bear--
    Back to your duty--for my course prepare:
    Myself this enterprise to-night will share."
    "To-night, Lord Conrad?"
                             "Aye! at set of sun:
    The breeze will freshen when the day is done.
    My corslet--cloak--one hour and we are gone.                        160
    Sling on thy bugle--see that free from rust
    My carbine-lock springs worthy of my trust;
    Be the edge sharpened of my boarding-brand,
    And give its guard more room to fit my hand.
    This let the Armourer with speed dispose;
    Last time, it more fatigued my arm than foes;
    Mark that the signal-gun be duly fired,
    To tell us when the hour of stay's expired."

                    VIII.

    They make obeisance, and retire in haste,
    Too soon to seek again the watery waste:                            170
    Yet they repine not--so that Conrad guides;
    And who dare question aught that he decides?
    That man of loneliness and mystery,
    Scarce seen to smile, and seldom heard to sigh;
    Whose name appals the fiercest of his crew,
    And tints each swarthy cheek with sallower hue;
    Still sways their souls with that commanding art
    That dazzles, leads, yet chills the vulgar heart.
    What is that spell, that thus his lawless train
    Confess and envy--yet oppose in vain?                               180
    What should it be, that thus their faith can bind?
    The power of Thought--the magic of the Mind!
    Linked with success, assumed and kept with skill,
    That moulds another's weakness to its will;
    Wields with their hands, but, still to these unknown,
    Makes even their mightiest deeds appear his own.
    Such hath it been--shall be--beneath the Sun
    The many still must labour for the one!
    'Tis Nature's doom--but let the wretch who toils,
    Accuse not--hate not--_him_ who wears the spoils.                   190
    Oh! if he knew the weight of splendid chains,
    How light the balance of his humbler pains!

                    IX.

    Unlike the heroes of each ancient race,
    Demons in act, but Gods at least in face,
    In Conrad's form seems little to admire,
    Though his dark eyebrow shades a glance of fire:
    Robust but not Herculean--to the sight
    No giant frame sets forth his common height;
    Yet, in the whole, who paused to look again,
    Saw more than marks the crowd of vulgar men;                        200
    They gaze and marvel how--and still confess
    That thus it is, but why they cannot guess.
    Sun-burnt his cheek, his forehead high and pale
    The sable curls in wild profusion veil;
    And oft perforce his rising lip reveals
    The haughtier thought it curbs, but scarce conceals.[hn]
    Though smooth his voice, and calm his general mien,
    Still seems there something he would not have seen:
    His features' deepening lines and varying hue
    At times attracted, yet perplexed the view,                         210
    As if within that murkiness of mind
    Worked feelings fearful, and yet undefined;
    Such might it be--that none could truly tell--
    Too close inquiry his stern glance would quell.
    There breathe but few whose aspect might defy
    The full encounter of his searching eye;
    He had the skill, when Cunning's gaze would seek[ho]
    To probe his heart and watch his changing cheek,
    At once the observer's purpose to espy,
    And on himself roll back his scrutiny,                              220
    Lest he to Conrad rather should betray
    Some secret thought, than drag that Chief's to day.
    There was a laughing Devil in his sneer,
    That raised emotions both of rage and fear;
    And where his frown of hatred darkly fell,
    Hope withering fled--and Mercy sighed farewell![200]

                    X.[201]

    Slight are the outward signs of evil thought,
    Within--within--'twas there the spirit wrought!
    Love shows all changes--Hate, Ambition, Guile,
    Betray no further than the bitter smile;                            230
    The lip's least curl, the lightest paleness thrown
    Along the governed aspect, speak alone
    Of deeper passions; and to judge their mien,
    He, who would see, must be himself unseen.
    Then--with the hurried tread, the upward eye,
    The clenched hand, the pause of agony,
    That listens, starting, lest the step too near
    Approach intrusive on that mood of fear:
    Then--with each feature working from the heart,
    With feelings, loosed to strengthen--not depart,                    240
    That rise--convulse--contend--that freeze or glow,[hp]
    Flush in the cheek, or damp upon the brow;
    Then--Stranger! if thou canst, and tremblest not,
    Behold his soul--the rest that soothes his lot![hq]
    Mark how that lone and blighted bosom sears
    The scathing thought of execrated years!
    Behold--but who hath seen, or e'er shall see,
    Man as himself--the secret spirit free?

                    XI.

    Yet was not Conrad thus by Nature sent
    To lead the guilty--Guilt's worse instrument--                      250
    His soul was changed, before his deeds had driven
    Him forth to war with Man and forfeit Heaven.
    Warped by the world in Disappointment's school,
    In words too wise--in conduct _there_ a fool;
    Too firm to yield, and far too proud to stoop,
    Doomed by his very virtues for a dupe,
    He cursed those virtues as the cause of ill,
    And not the traitors who betrayed him still;
    Nor deemed that gifts bestowed on better men
    Had left him joy, and means to give again.                          260
    Feared--shunned--belied--ere Youth had lost her force,
    He hated Man too much to feel remorse,
    And thought the voice of Wrath a sacred call,
    To pay the injuries of some on all.
    He knew himself a villain--but he deemed
    The rest no better than the thing he seemed;
    And scorned the best as hypocrites who hid
    Those deeds the bolder spirit plainly did.
    He knew himself detested, but he knew
    The hearts that loathed him, crouched and dreaded too.              270
    Lone, wild, and strange, he stood alike exempt
    From all affection and from all contempt:
    His name could sadden, and his acts surprise;
    But they that feared him dared not to despise:
    Man spurns the worm, but pauses ere he wake
    The slumbering venom of the folded snake:
    The first may turn, but not avenge the blow;
    The last expires, but leaves no living foe;
    Fast to the doomed offender's form it clings,
    And he may crush--not conquer--still it stings![202]                280

                    XII.

    None are all evil--quickening round his heart,
    One softer feeling would not yet depart;
    Oft could he sneer at others as beguiled
    By passions worthy of a fool or child;
    Yet 'gainst that passion vainly still he strove,
    And even in him it asks the name of Love!
    Yes, it was love--unchangeable--unchanged,
    Felt but for one from whom he never ranged;
    Though fairest captives daily met his eye,
    He shunned, nor sought, but coldly passed them by;                  290
    Though many a beauty drooped in prisoned bower,
    None ever soothed his most unguarded hour,
    Yes--it was Love--if thoughts of tenderness,
    Tried in temptation, strengthened by distress,
    Unmoved by absence, firm in every clime,
    And yet--Oh more than all!--untired by Time;
    Which nor defeated hope, nor baffled wile,
    Could render sullen were She near to smile,
    Nor rage could fire, nor sickness fret to vent
    On her one murmur of his discontent;                                300
    Which still would meet with joy, with calmness part,
    Lest that his look of grief should reach her heart;
    Which nought removed, nor menaced to remove--
    If there be Love in mortals--this was Love!
    He was a villain--aye, reproaches shower
    On him--but not the Passion, nor its power,
    Which only proved--all other virtues gone--
    Not Guilt itself could quench this loveliest one![hr]

                    XIII.

    He paused a moment--till his hastening men
    Passed the first winding downward to the glen.                      310
    "Strange tidings!--many a peril have I passed,
    Nor know I why this next appears the last!
    Yet so my heart forebodes, but must not fear,
    Nor shall my followers find me falter here.
    'Tis rash to meet--but surer death to wait
    Till here they hunt us to undoubted fate;
    And, if my plan but hold, and Fortune smile,
    We'll furnish mourners for our funeral pile.
    Aye, let them slumber--peaceful be their dreams!
    Morn ne'er awoke them with such brilliant beams                     320
    As kindle high to-night (but blow, thou breeze!)
    To warm these slow avengers of the seas.
    Now to Medora--Oh! my sinking heart,[hs]
    Long may her own be lighter than thou art!
    Yet was I brave--mean boast where all are brave!
    Ev'n insects sting for aught they seek to save.
    This common courage which with brutes we share,
    That owes its deadliest efforts to Despair,
    Small merit claims--but 'twas my nobler hope
    To teach my few with numbers still to cope;                         330
    Long have I led them--not to vainly bleed:
    No medium now--we perish or succeed!
    So let it be--it irks not me to die;
    But thus to urge them whence they cannot fly.
    My lot hath long had little of my care,
    But chafes my pride thus baffled in the snare:
    Is this my skill? my craft? to set at last
    Hope, Power and Life upon a single cast?
    Oh, Fate!--accuse thy folly--not thy fate;
    She may redeem thee still--nor yet too late."     340

                    XIV.

    Thus with himself communion held he, till
    He reached the summit of his tower-crowned hill:
    There at the portal paused--for wild and soft
    He heard those accents never heard too oft!
    Through the high lattice far yet sweet they rung,
    And these the notes his Bird of Beauty sung:

                    1.

    "Deep in my soul that tender secret dwells,
      Lonely and lost to light for evermore,
    Save when to thine my heart responsive swells,
      Then trembles into silence as before.                             350

                    2.

    "There, in its centre, a sepulchral lamp
      Burns the slow flame, eternal--but unseen;
    Which not the darkness of Despair can damp,
      Though vain its ray as it had never been.

                    3.

    "Remember me--Oh! pass not thou my grave
      Without one thought whose relics there recline:
    The only pang my bosom dare not brave
      Must be to find forgetfulness in thine.

                    4.

    "My fondest--faintest--latest accents hear--[ht]
      Grief for the dead not Virtue can reprove;                        360
    Then give me all I ever asked--a tear,[203]
      The first--last--sole reward of so much love!"

    He passed the portal, crossed the corridor,
    And reached the chamber as the strain gave o'er:
    "My own Medora! sure thy song is sad--"

    "In Conrad's absence would'st thou have it glad?
    Without thine ear to listen to my lay,
    Still must my song my thoughts, my soul betray:
    Still must each accent to my bosom suit,
    My heart unhushed--although my lips were mute!                      370
    Oh! many a night on this lone couch reclined,
    My dreaming fear with storms hath winged the wind,
    And deemed the breath that faintly fanned thy sail
    The murmuring prelude of the ruder gale;
    Though soft--it seemed the low prophetic dirge,
    That mourned thee floating on the savage surge:
    Still would I rise to rouse the beacon fire,
    Lest spies less true should let the blaze expire;
    And many a restless hour outwatched each star,
    And morning came--and still thou wert afar.                         380
    Oh! how the chill blast on my bosom blew,
    And day broke dreary on my troubled view,
    And still I gazed and gazed--and not a prow
    Was granted to my tears--my truth--my vow!
    At length--'twas noon--I hailed and blest the mast
    That met my sight--it neared--Alas! it passed!
    Another came--Oh God! 'twas thine at last!
    Would that those days were over! wilt thou ne'er,
    My Conrad! learn the joys of peace to share?
    Sure thou hast more than wealth, and many a home                    390
    As bright as this invites us not to roam:
    Thou know'st it is not peril that I fear,
    I only tremble when thou art not here;
    Then not for mine, but that far dearer life,
    Which flies from love and languishes for strife--
    How strange that heart, to me so tender still,
    Should war with Nature and its better will!"

    "Yea, strange indeed--that heart hath long been changed;
    Worm-like 'twas trampled--adder-like avenged--
    Without one hope on earth beyond thy love,                          400
    And scarce a glimpse of mercy from above.
    Yet the same feeling which thou dost condemn,
    My very love to thee is hate to them,
    So closely mingling here, that disentwined,
    I cease to love thee when I love Mankind:
    Yet dread not this--the proof of all the past
    Assures the future that my love will last;
    But--Oh, Medora! nerve thy gentler heart;
    This hour again--but not for long--we part."

    "This hour we part!--my heart foreboded this:                       410
    Thus ever fade my fairy dreams of bliss.
    This hour--it cannot be--this hour away!
    Yon bark hath hardly anchored in the bay:
    Her consort still is absent, and her crew
    Have need of rest before they toil anew;
    My Love! thou mock'st my weakness; and wouldst steel
    My breast before the time when it must feel;
    But trifle now no more with my distress,
    Such mirth hath less of play than bitterness.
    Be silent, Conrad!--dearest! come and share                         420
    The feast these hands delighted to prepare;
    Light toil! to cull and dress thy frugal fare!
    See, I have plucked the fruit that promised best,
    And where not sure, perplexed, but pleased, I guessed
    At such as seemed the fairest; thrice the hill
    My steps have wound to try the coolest rill;
    Yes! thy Sherbet to-night will sweetly flow,
    See how it sparkles in its vase of snow!
    The grapes' gay juice thy bosom never cheers;
    Thou more than Moslem when the cup appears:                         430
    Think not I mean to chide--for I rejoice
    What others deem a penance is thy choice.
    But come, the board is spread; our silver lamp
    Is trimmed, and heeds not the Sirocco's damp:
    Then shall my handmaids while the time along,
    And join with me the dance, or wake the song;
    Or my guitar, which still thou lov'st to hear,
    Shall soothe or lull--or, should it vex thine ear,
    We'll turn the tale, by Ariosto told,
    Of fair Olympia loved and left of old.[204]                         440
    Why, thou wert worse than he who broke his vow
    To that lost damsel, should thou leave me _now_--
    Or even that traitor chief--I've seen thee smile,
    When the clear sky showed Ariadne's Isle,
    Which I have pointed from these cliffs the while:
    And thus half sportive--half in fear--I said,
    Lest Time should raise that doubt to more than dread,
    Thus Conrad, too, will quit me for the main:
    And he deceived me--for--he came again!"

    "Again, again--and oft again--my Love!                              450
    If there be life below, and hope above,
    He will return--but now, the moments bring
    The time of parting with redoubled wing:
    The why, the where--what boots it now to tell?
    Since all must end in that wild word--Farewell!
    Yet would I fain--did time allow--disclose--
    Fear not--these are no formidable foes!
    And here shall watch a more than wonted guard,
    For sudden siege and long defence prepared:
    Nor be thou lonely, though thy Lord's away,                         460
    Our matrons and thy handmaids with thee stay;
    And this thy comfort--that, when next we meet,
    Security shall make repose more sweet.
    List!--'tis the bugle!"--Juan shrilly blew--
    "One kiss--one more--another--Oh! Adieu!"
    She rose--she sprung--she clung to his embrace,
    Till his heart heaved beneath her hidden face:
    He dared not raise to his that deep-blue eye,
    Which downcast drooped in tearless agony.
    Her long fair hair lay floating o'er his arms,                      470
    In all the wildness of dishevelled charms;
    Scarce beat that bosom where his image dwelt
    So full--_that_ feeling seem'd almost unfelt!
    Hark--peals the thunder of the signal-gun!
    It told 'twas sunset, and he cursed that sun.
    Again--again--that form he madly pressed,
    Which mutely clasped, imploringly caressed![hu]
    And tottering to the couch his bride he bore,
    One moment gazed--as if to gaze no more;
    Felt that for him Earth held but her alone,                         480
    Kissed her cold forehead--turned--is Conrad gone?

                    XV.

    "And is he gone?"--on sudden solitude
    How oft that fearful question will intrude!
    "'Twas but an instant past, and here he stood!
    And now"--without the portal's porch she rushed,
    And then at length her tears in freedom gushed;
    Big, bright, and fast, unknown to her they fell;
    But still her lips refused to send--"Farewell!"
    For in that word--that fatal word--howe'er
    We promise--hope--believe--there breathes Despair.                  490
    O'er every feature of that still, pale face,
    Had Sorrow fixed what Time can ne'er erase:
    The tender blue of that large loving eye
    Grew frozen with its gaze on vacancy,
    Till--Oh, how far!--it caught a glimpse of him,
    And then it flowed, and phrensied seemed to swim
    Through those long, dark, and glistening lashes dewed
    With drops of sadness oft to be renewed.
    "He's gone!"--against her heart that hand is driven,
    Convulsed and quick--then gently raised to Heaven:                  500
    She looked and saw the heaving of the main:
    The white sail set--she dared not look again;
    But turned with sickening soul within the gate--
    "It is no dream--and I am desolate!"

                    XVI.

    From crag to crag descending, swiftly sped
    Stern Conrad down, nor once he turned his head;
    But shrunk whene'er the windings of his way
    Forced on his eye what he would not survey,
    His lone, but lovely dwelling on the steep,
    That hailed him first when homeward from the deep:                  510
    And she--the dim and melancholy Star,
    Whose ray of Beauty reached him from afar,
    On her he must not gaze, he must not think--
    There he might rest--but on Destruction's brink:
    Yet once almost he stopped--and nearly gave
    His fate to chance, his projects to the wave:
    But no--it must not be--a worthy chief
    May melt, but not betray to Woman's grief.
    He sees his bark, he notes how fair the wind,
    And sternly gathers all his might of mind:                          520
    Again he hurries on--and as he hears
    The clang of tumult vibrate on his ears,
    The busy sounds, the bustle of the shore,
    The shout, the signal, and the dashing oar;
    As marks his eye the seaboy on the mast,
    The anchors rise, the sails unfurling fast,
    The waving kerchiefs of the crowd that urge
    That mute Adieu to those who stem the surge;
    And more than all, his blood-red flag aloft,
    He marvelled how his heart could seem so soft.                      530
    Fire in his glance, and wildness in his breast,
    He feels of all his former self possest;
    He bounds--he flies--until his footsteps reach
    The verge where ends the cliff, begins the beach,
    There checks his speed; but pauses less to breathe
    The breezy freshness of the deep beneath,
    Than there his wonted statelier step renew;
    Nor rush, disturbed by haste, to vulgar view:
    For well had Conrad learned to curb the crowd,
    By arts that veil, and oft preserve the proud;                      540
    His was the lofty port, the distant mien,
    That seems to shun the sight--and awes if seen:
    The solemn aspect, and the high-born eye,
    That checks low mirth, but lacks not courtesy;
    All these he wielded to command assent:
    But where he wished to win, so well unbent,
    That Kindness cancelled fear in those who heard,
    And others' gifts showed mean beside his word,
    When echoed to the heart as from his own
    His deep yet tender melody of tone:                                 550
    But such was foreign to his wonted mood,
    He cared not what he softened, but subdued;
    The evil passions of his youth had made
    Him value less who loved--than what obeyed.

                    XVII.

    Around him mustering ranged his ready guard.
    Before him Juan stands--"Are all prepared?"
    "They are--nay more--embarked: the latest boat
    Waits but my chief----"
                           "My sword, and my capote."
    Soon firmly girded on, and lightly slung,
    His belt and cloak were o'er his shoulders flung:                   560
    "Call Pedro here!" He comes--and Conrad bends,
    With all the courtesy he deigned his friends;
    "Receive these tablets, and peruse with care,
    Words of high trust and truth are graven there;
    Double the guard, and when Anselmo's bark
    Arrives, let him alike these orders mark:
    In three days (serve the breeze) the sun shall shine
    On our return--till then all peace be thine!"
    This said, his brother Pirate's hand he wrung,
    Then to his boat with haughty gesture sprung.                       570
    Flashed the dipt oars, and sparkling with the stroke,
    Around the waves' phosphoric[205] brightness broke;
    They gain the vessel--on the deck he stands,--
    Shrieks the shrill whistle, ply the busy hands--
    He marks how well the ship her helm obeys,
    How gallant all her crew, and deigns to praise.
    His eyes of pride to young Gonsalvo turn--
    Why doth he start, and inly seem to mourn?
    Alas! those eyes beheld his rocky tower,
    And live a moment o'er the parting hour;                            580
    She--his Medora--did she mark the prow?
    Ah! never loved he half so much as now!
    But much must yet be done ere dawn of day--
    Again he mans himself and turns away;
    Down to the cabin with Gonsalvo bends,
    And there unfolds his plan--his means, and ends;
    Before them burns the lamp, and spreads the chart,
    And all that speaks and aids the naval art;
    They to the midnight watch protract debate;
    To anxious eyes what hour is ever late?                             590
    Meantime, the steady breeze serenely blew,
    And fast and falcon-like the vessel flew;
    Passed the high headlands of each clustering isle,
    To gain their port--long--long ere morning smile:
    And soon the night-glass through the narrow bay
    Discovers where the Pacha's galleys lay.
    Count they each sail, and mark how there supine
    The lights in vain o'er heedless Moslem shine.
    Secure, unnoted, Conrad's prow passed by,
    And anchored where his ambush meant to lie;                         600
    Screened from espial by the jutting cape,
    That rears on high its rude fantastic shape.[206]
    Then rose his band to duty--not from sleep--
    Equipped for deeds alike on land or deep;
    While leaned their Leader o'er the fretting flood,
    And calmly talked--and yet he talked of blood!



                     CANTO THE SECOND.

              "Conosceste i dubbiosi desiri?"
                        Dante, _Inferno_, v, 120.

                    I.

    In Coron's bay floats many a galley light,
    Through Coron's lattices the lamps are bright,[207]
    For Seyd, the Pacha, makes a feast to-night:
    A feast for promised triumph yet to come,                           610
    When he shall drag the fettered Rovers home;
    This hath he sworn by Allah and his sword,
    And faithful to his firman and his word,
    His summoned prows collect along the coast,
    And great the gathering crews, and loud the boast;
    Already shared the captives and the prize,
    Though far the distant foe they thus despise;
    'Tis but to sail--no doubt to-morrow's Sun
    Will see the Pirates bound--their haven won!
    Meantime the watch may slumber, if they will,                       620
    Nor only wake to war, but dreaming kill.
    Though all, who can, disperse on shore and seek
    To flesh their glowing valour on the Greek;
    How well such deed becomes the turbaned brave--
    To bare the sabre's edge before a slave!
    Infest his dwelling--but forbear to slay,
    Their arms are strong, yet merciful to-day,
    And do not deign to smite because they may!
    Unless some gay caprice suggests the blow,
    To keep in practice for the coming foe.                             630
    Revel and rout the evening hours beguile,
    And they who wish to wear a head must smile;
    For Moslem mouths produce their choicest cheer,
    And hoard their curses, till the coast is clear.

                    II.

    High in his hall reclines the turbaned Seyd;
    Around--the bearded chiefs he came to lead.
    Removed the banquet, and the last pilaff--
    Forbidden draughts, 'tis said, he dared to quaff,
    Though to the rest the sober berry's juice[208]
    The slaves bear round for rigid Moslems' use;                       640
    The long chibouque's[209] dissolving cloud supply,
    While dance the Almas[210] to wild minstrelsy.
    The rising morn will view the chiefs embark;
    But waves are somewhat treacherous in the dark:
    And revellers may more securely sleep
    On silken couch than o'er the rugged deep:
    Feast there who can--nor combat till they must,
    And less to conquest than to Korans trust;
    And yet the numbers crowded in his host
    Might warrant more than even the Pacha's boast.                     650

                    III.

    With cautious reverence from the outer gate
    Slow stalks the slave, whose office there to wait,
    Bows his bent head--his hand salutes the floor,
    Ere yet his tongue the trusted tidings bore:
    "A captive Dervise, from the Pirate's nest
    Escaped, is here--himself would tell the rest."[211]
    He took the sign from Seyd's assenting eye,
    And led the holy man in silence nigh.
    His arms were folded on his dark-green vest,
    His step was feeble, and his look deprest;                          660
    Yet worn he seemed of hardship more than years,
    And pale his cheek with penance, not from fears.
    Vowed to his God--his sable locks he wore,
    And these his lofty cap rose proudly o'er:
    Around his form his loose long robe was thrown,
    And wrapt a breast bestowed on heaven alone;
    Submissive, yet with self-possession manned,
    He calmly met the curious eyes that scanned;
    And question of his coming fain would seek,
    Before the Pacha's will allowed to speak.                           670

                    IV.

    "Whence com'st thou, Dervise?"
                                   "From the Outlaw's den
    A fugitive--"
                   "Thy capture where and when?"
    "From Scalanova's port[212] to Scio's isle,
    The Saick[213] was bound; but Allah did not smile
    Upon our course--the Moslem merchant's gains
    The Rovers won; our limbs have worn their chains.
    I had no death to fear, nor wealth to boast,
    Beyond the wandering freedom which I lost;
    At length a fisher's humble boat by night
    Afforded hope, and offered chance of flight;                        680
    I seized the hour, and find my safety here--
    With thee--most mighty Pacha! who can fear?"

    "How speed the outlaws? stand they well prepared,
    Their plundered wealth, and robber's rock, to guard?
    Dream they of this our preparation, doomed
    To view with fire their scorpion nest consumed?"

    "Pacha! the fettered captive's mourning eye,
    That weeps for flight, but ill can play the spy;
    I only heard the reckless waters roar,
    Those waves that would not bear me from the shore;                  690
    I only marked the glorious Sun and sky,
    Too bright--too blue--for my captivity;
    And felt that all which Freedom's bosom cheers
    Must break my chain before it dried my tears.
    This mayst thou judge, at least, from my escape,
    They little deem of aught in Peril's shape;
    Else vainly had I prayed or sought the Chance
    That leads me here--if eyed with vigilance:
    The careless guard that did not see me fly,
    May watch as idly when thy power is nigh.                           700
    Pacha! my limbs are faint--and nature craves
    Food for my hunger, rest from tossing waves:
    Permit my absence--peace be with thee! Peace
    With all around!--now grant repose--release."

    "Stay, Dervise! I have more to question--stay,
    I do command thee--sit--dost hear?--obey!
    More I must ask, and food the slaves shall bring;
    Thou shall not pine where all are banqueting:
    The supper done--prepare thee to reply,
    Clearly and full--I love not mystery."                              710
    'Twere vain to guess what shook the pious man,
    Who looked not lovingly on that Divan;
    Nor showed high relish for the banquet prest,
    And less respect for every fellow guest.
    Twas but a moment's peevish hectic passed
    Along his cheek, and tranquillised as fast:
    He sate him down in silence, and his look
    Resumed the calmness which before forsook:
    The feast was ushered in--but sumptuous fare
    He shunned as if some poison mingled there.                         720
    For one so long condemned to toil and fast,
    Methinks he strangely spares the rich repast.
    "What ails thee, Dervise? eat--dost thou suppose
    This feast a Christian's? or my friends thy foes?
    Why dost thou shun the salt? that sacred pledge,[214]
    Which, once partaken, blunts the sabre's edge,
    Makes even contending tribes in peace unite,
    And hated hosts seem brethren to the sight!"

    "Salt seasons dainties--and my food is still
    The humblest root, my drink the simplest rill;                      730
    And my stern vow and Order's[215] laws oppose
    To break or mingle bread with friends or foes;
    It may seem strange--if there be aught to dread
    That peril rests upon my single head;
    But for thy sway--nay more--thy Sultan's throne,
    I taste nor bread nor banquet--save alone;
    Infringed our Order's rule, the Prophet's rage
    To Mecca's dome might bar my pilgrimage."

    "Well--as thou wilt--ascetic as thou art--
    One question answer; then in peace depart.                          740
    How many?--Ha! it cannot sure be day?
    What Star--what Sun is bursting on the bay?
    It shines a lake of fire!--away--away!
    Ho! treachery! my guards! my scimitar!
    The galleys feed the flames--and I afar!
    Accursed Dervise!--these thy tidings--thou
    Some villain spy--seize--cleave him--slay him now!"

    Up rose the Dervise with that burst of light,
    Nor less his change of form appalled the sight:
    Up rose that Dervise--not in saintly garb,                          750
    But like a warrior bounding on his barb,
    Dashed his high cap, and tore his robe away--
    Shone his mailed breast, and flashed his sabre's ray!
    His close but glittering casque, and sable plume,
    More glittering eye, and black brow's sabler gloom,
    Glared on the Moslems' eyes some Afrit Sprite,
    Whose demon death-blow left no hope for fight.
    The wild confusion, and the swarthy glow
    Of flames on high, and torches from below;
    The shriek of terror, and the mingling yell--                       760
    For swords began to clash, and shouts to swell--
    Flung o'er that spot of earth the air of Hell!
    Distracted, to and fro, the flying slaves
    Behold but bloody shore and fiery waves;
    Nought heeded they the Pacha's angry cry,
    _They_ seize that Dervise!--seize on Zatanai![216]
    He saw their terror--checked the first despair
    That urged him but to stand and perish there,
    Since far too early and too well obeyed,
    The flame was kindled ere the signal made;                          770
    He saw their terror--from his baldric drew
    His bugle--brief the blast--but shrilly blew;
    'Tis answered--"Well ye speed, my gallant crew!
    Why did I doubt their quickness of career?
    And deem design had left me single here?"
    Sweeps his long arm--that sabre's whirling sway
    Sheds fast atonement for its first delay;
    Completes his fury, what their fear begun,
    And makes the many basely quail to one.
    The cloven turbans o'er the chamber spread,                         780
    And scarce an arm dare rise to guard its head:
    Even Seyd, convulsed, o'erwhelmed, with rage, surprise,
    Retreats before him, though he still defies.
    No craven he--and yet he dreads the blow,
    So much Confusion magnifies his foe!
    His blazing galleys still distract his sight,
    He tore his beard, and foaming fled the fight;[217]
    For now the pirates passed the Haram gate,
    And burst within--and it were death to wait;
    Where wild Amazement shrieking--kneeling--throws                    790
    The sword aside--in vain--the blood o'erflows!
    The Corsairs pouring, haste to where within
    Invited Conrad's bugle, and the din
    Of groaning victims, and wild cries for life,
    Proclaimed how well he did the work of strife.
    They shout to find him grim and lonely there,
    A glutted tiger mangling in his lair!
    But short their greeting, shorter his reply--
    "'Tis well--but Seyd escapes--and he must die--
    Much hath been done--but more remains to do--                       800
    Their galleys blaze--why not their city too?"

                    V.

    Quick at the word they seized him each a torch,
    And fire the dome from minaret to porch.
    A stern delight was fixed in Conrad's eye,
    But sudden sunk--for on his ear the cry
    Of women struck, and like a deadly knell
    Knocked at that heart unmoved by Battle's yell.
    "Oh! burst the Haram--wrong not on your lives
    One female form--remember--_we_ have wives.
    On them such outrage Vengeance will repay;                          810
    Man is our foe, and such 'tis ours to slay:
    But still we spared--must spare the weaker prey.
    Oh! I forgot--but Heaven will not forgive
    If at my word the helpless cease to live;
    Follow who will--I go--we yet have time
    Our souls to lighten of at least a crime."
    He climbs the crackling stair--he bursts the door,
    Nor feels his feet glow scorching with the floor;
    His breath choked gasping with the volumed smoke,
    But still from room to room his way he broke.                       820
    They search--they find--they save: with lusty arms
    Each bears a prize of unregarded charms;
    Calm their loud fears; sustain their sinking frames
    With all the care defenceless Beauty claims:
    So well could Conrad tame their fiercest mood,
    And check the very hands with gore imbrued.
    But who is she? whom Conrad's arms convey,
    From reeking pile and combat's wreck, away--
    Who but the love of him he dooms to bleed?
    The Haram queen--but still the slave of Seyd!                       830

                    VI.

    Brief time had Conrad now to greet Gulnare,[218]
    Few words to reassure the trembling Fair;
    For in that pause Compassion snatched from War,
    The foe before retiring, fast and far,
    With wonder saw their footsteps unpursued,
    First slowlier fled--then rallied--then withstood.
    This Seyd perceives, then first perceives how few,
    Compared with his, the Corsair's roving crew,
    And blushes o'er his error, as he eyes
    The ruin wrought by Panic and Surprise.                             840
    Alla il Alla! Vengeance swells the cry--
    Shame mounts to rage that must atone or die!
    And flame for flame and blood for blood must tell.
    The tide of triumph ebbs that flowed too well--
    When Wrath returns to renovated strife,
    And those who fought for conquest strike for life.
    Conrad beheld the danger--he beheld
    His followers faint by freshening foes repelled:
    "One effort--one--to break the circling host!"
    They form--unite--charge--waver--all is lost!                       850
    Within a narrower ring compressed, beset,
    Hopeless, not heartless, strive and struggle yet--
    Ah! now they fight in firmest file no more,
    Hemmed in--cut off--cleft down and trampled o'er;
    But each strikes singly--silently--and home,
    And sinks outwearied rather than o'ercome--
    His last faint quittance rendering with his breath,
    Till the blade glimmers in the grasp of Death!

                    VII.

    But first, ere came the rallying host to blows,
    And rank to rank, and hand to hand oppose,                          860
    Gulnare and all her Haram handmaids freed,
    Safe in the dome of one who held their creed,
    By Conrad's mandate safely were bestowed,
    And dried those tears for life and fame that flowed:
    And when that dark-eyed lady, young Gulnare,
    Recalled those thoughts late wandering in despair,
    Much did she marvel o'er the courtesy
    That smoothed his accents, softened in his eye--
    'Twas strange--_that_ robber thus with gore bedewed,
    Seemed gentler then than Seyd in fondest mood.                      870
    The Pacha wooed as if he deemed the slave
    _Must_ seem delighted with the heart he gave;
    The Corsair vowed protection, soothed affright,
    As if his homage were a Woman's right.
    "The wish is wrong--nay, worse for female--vain:
    Yet much I long to view that Chief again;
    If but to thank for, what my fear forgot,
    The life--my loving Lord remembered not!"

                    VIII.

    And him she saw, where thickest carnage spread,
    But gathered breathing from the happier dead;                       880
    Far from his band, and battling with a host
    That deem right dearly won the field he lost,
    Felled--bleeding--baffled of the death he sought,
    And snatched to expiate all the ills he wrought;
    Preserved to linger and to live in vain,
    While Vengeance pondered o'er new plans of pain,
    And stanched the blood she saves to shed again--
    But drop by drop, for Seyd's unglutted eye
    Would doom him ever dying--ne'er to die!
    Can this be he? triumphant late she saw,                            890
    When his red hand's wild gesture waved, a law!
    'Tis he indeed--disarmed but undeprest,
    His sole regret the life he still possest;
    His wounds too slight, though taken with that will,
    Which would have kissed the hand that then could kill.
    Oh were there none, of all the many given,
    To send his soul--he scarcely asked to Heaven?[219]
    Must he alone of all retain his breath,
    Who more than all had striven and struck for death?
    He deeply felt--what mortal hearts must feel,                       900
    When thus reversed on faithless Fortune's wheel,
    For crimes committed, and the victor's threat
    Of lingering tortures to repay the debt--
    He deeply, darkly felt; but evil Pride
    That led to perpetrate--now serves to hide.
    Still in his stern and self-collected mien
    A conqueror's more than captive's air is seen,
    Though faint with wasting toil and stiffening wound,
    But few that saw--so calmly gazed around:
    Though the far shouting of the distant crowd,                       910
    Their tremors o'er, rose insolently loud,
    The better warriors who beheld him near,
    Insulted not the foe who taught them fear;
    And the grim guards that to his durance led,
    In silence eyed him with a secret dread.

                    IX.

    The Leech was sent--but not in mercy--there,
    To note how much the life yet left could bear;
    He found enough to load with heaviest chain,
    And promise feeling for the wrench of Pain;
    To-morrow--yea--to-morrow's evening Sun                             920
    Will, sinking, see Impalement's pangs begun,
    And rising with the wonted blush of morn
    Behold how well or ill those pangs are borne.
    Of torments this the longest and the worst,
    Which adds all other agony to thirst,
    That day by day Death still forbears to slake,
    While famished vultures flit around the stake.
    "Oh! water--water!"--smiling Hate denies
    The victim's prayer, for if he drinks he dies.
    This was his doom;--the Leech, the guard, were gone,                930
    And left proud Conrad fettered and alone.

                    X.

    'Twere vain to paint to what his feelings grew--
    It even were doubtful if their victim knew.
    There is a war, a chaos of the mind,[220]
    When all its elements convulsed, combined
    Lie dark and jarring with perturbed force,
    And gnashing with impenitent Remorse--
    That juggling fiend, who never spake before,
    But cries "I warned thee!" when the deed is o'er.
    Vain voice! the spirit burning but unbent,                          940
    May writhe--rebel--the weak alone repent!
    Even in that lonely hour when most it feels,
    And, to itself, all--all that self reveals,--
    No single passion, and no ruling thought
    That leaves the rest, as once, unseen, unsought,
    But the wild prospect when the Soul reviews,
    _All_ rushing through their thousand avenues--
    Ambition's dreams expiring, Love's regret,
    Endangered Glory, Life itself beset;
    The joy untasted, the contempt or hate                              950
    'Gainst those who fain would triumph in our fate;
    The hopeless past, the hasting future driven
    Too quickly on to guess if Hell or Heaven;
    Deeds--thoughts--and words, perhaps remembered not
    So keenly till that hour, but ne'er forgot;
    Things light or lovely in their acted time,
    But now to stern Reflection each a crime;
    The withering sense of Evil unrevealed,
    Not cankering less because the more concealed;
    All, in a word, from which all eyes must start,                     960
    That opening sepulchre, the naked heart[221]
    Bares with its buried woes--till Pride awake,
    To snatch the mirror from the soul, and break.
    Aye, Pride can veil, and Courage brave it all--
    All--all--before--beyond--the deadliest fall.
    Each hath some fear, and he who least betrays,
    The only hypocrite deserving praise:
    Not the loud recreant wretch who boasts and flies;
    But he who looks on Death--and silent dies:
    So, steeled by pondering o'er his far career,                       970
    He half-way meets Him should He menace near!

                    XI.

    In the high chamber of his highest tower
    Sate Conrad, fettered in the Pacha's power.
    His palace perished in the flame--this fort
    Contained at once his captive and his court.
    Not much could Conrad of his sentence blame,
    His foe, if vanquished, had but shared the same:--
    Alone he sate--in solitude had scanned
    His guilty bosom, but that breast he manned:
    One thought alone he could not--dared not meet--                    980
    "Oh, how these tidings will Medora greet?"
    Then--only then--his clanking hands he raised,
    And strained with rage the chain on which he gazed;
    But soon he found, or feigned, or dreamed relief,
    And smiled in self-derision of his grief,
    "And now come Torture when it will, or may--
    More need of rest to nerve me for the day!"
    This said, with langour to his mat he crept,
    And, whatso'er his visions, quickly slept.

    'Twas hardly midnight when that fray begun,                         990
    For Conrad's plans matured, at once were done,
    And Havoc loathes so much the waste of time,
    She scarce had left an uncommitted crime.
    One hour beheld him since the tide he stemmed--
    Disguised--discovered--conquering--ta'en--condemned--
    A Chief on land--an outlaw on the deep--
    Destroying--saving--prisoned--and asleep!

                    XII.

    He slept in calmest seeming, for his breath[222]
    Was hushed so deep--Ah! happy if in death!
    He slept--Who o'er his placid slumber bends?                       1000
    His foes are gone--and here he hath no friends;
    Is it some Seraph sent to grant him grace?
    No,'tis an earthly form with heavenly face!
    Its white arm raised a lamp--yet gently hid,
    Lest the ray flash abruptly on the lid
    Of that closed eye, which opens but to pain,
    And once unclosed--but once may close again.
    That form, with eye so dark, and cheek so fair,
    And auburn waves of gemmed and braided hair;
    With shape of fairy lightness--naked foot,                         1010
    That shines like snow, and falls on earth as mute--
    Through guards and dunnest night how came it there?
    Ah! rather ask what will not Woman dare?
    Whom Youth and Pity lead like thee, Gulnare!
    She could not sleep--and while the Pacha's rest
    In muttering dreams yet saw his pirate-guest,
    She left his side--his signet-ring she bore,
    Which oft in sport adorned her hand before--
    And with it, scarcely questioned, won her way
    Through drowsy guards that must that sign obey.                    1020
    Worn out with toil, and tired with changing blows,
    Their eyes had envied Conrad his repose;
    And chill and nodding at the turret door,
    They stretch their listless limbs, and watch no more;
    Just raised their heads to hail the signet-ring,
    Nor ask or what or who the sign may bring.

                    XIII.

    She gazed in wonder, "Can he calmly sleep,
    While other eyes his fall or ravage weep?
    And mine in restlessness are wandering here--
    What sudden spell hath made this man so dear?                      1030
    True--'tis to him my life, and more, I owe,
    And me and mine he spared from worse than woe:
    'Tis late to think--but soft--his slumber breaks--
    How heavily he sighs!--he starts--awakes!"
    He raised his head, and dazzled with the light,
    His eye seemed dubious if it saw aright:
    He moved his hand--the grating of his chain
    Too harshly told him that he lived again.
    "What is that form? if not a shape of air,
    Methinks, my jailor's face shows wondrous fair!"                   1040
    "Pirate! thou know'st me not, but I am one,
    Grateful for deeds thou hast too rarely done;
    Look on me--and remember her, thy hand
    Snatched from the flames, and thy more fearful band.
    I come through darkness--and I scarce know why--
    Yet not to hurt--I would not see thee die."

    "If so, kind lady! thine the only eye
    That would not here in that gay hope delight:
    Theirs is the chance--and let them use their right.
    But still I thank their courtesy or thine,                         1050
    That would confess me at so fair a shrine!"

    Strange though it seem--yet with extremest grief
    Is linked a mirth--it doth not bring relief--
    That playfulness of Sorrow ne'er beguiles,
    And smiles in bitterness--but still it smiles;
    And sometimes with the wisest and the best,
    Till even the scaffold[223] echoes with their jest!
    Yet not the joy to which it seems akin--
    It may deceive all hearts, save that within.
    Whate'er it was that flashed on Conrad, now                        1060
    A laughing wildness half unbent his brow:
    And these his accents had a sound of mirth,
    As if the last he could enjoy on earth;
    Yet 'gainst his nature--for through that short life,
    Few thoughts had he to spare from gloom and strife.

                    XIV.

    "Corsair! thy doom is named--but I have power
    To soothe the Pacha in his weaker hour.
    Thee would I spare--nay more--would save thee now,
    But this--Time--Hope--nor even thy strength allow;
    But all I can,--I will--at least delay                             1070
    The sentence that remits thee scarce a day.
    More now were ruin--even thyself were loth
    The vain attempt should bring but doom to both."

    "Yes!--loth indeed:--my soul is nerved to all,
    Or fall'n too low to fear a further fall:
    Tempt not thyself with peril--me with hope
    Of flight from foes with whom I could not cope:
    Unfit to vanquish--shall I meanly fly,
    The one of all my band that would not die?
    Yet there is one--to whom my Memory clings,                        1080
    Till to these eyes her own wild softness springs.
    My sole resources in the path I trod
    Were these--my bark--my sword--my love--my God!
    The last I left in youth!--He leaves me now--
    And Man but works his will to lay me low.
    I have no thought to mock his throne with prayer
    Wrung from the coward crouching of Despair;
    It is enough--I breathe--and I can bear.
    My sword is shaken from the worthless hand
    That might have better kept so true a brand;                       1090
    My bark is sunk or captive--but my Love--
    For her in sooth my voice would mount above:
    Oh! she is all that still to earth can bind--
    And this will break a heart so more than kind,
    And blight a form--till thine appeared, Gulnare!
    Mine eye ne'er asked if others were as fair."

    "Thou lov'st another then?--but what to me
    Is this--'tis nothing--nothing e'er can be:
    But yet--thou lov'st--and--Oh! I envy those
    Whose hearts on hearts as faithful can repose,                     1100
    Who never feel the void--the wandering thought
    That sighs o'er visions--such as mine hath wrought."

    "Lady--methought thy love was his, for whom
    This arm redeemed thee from a fiery tomb."

    "My love stern Seyd's! Oh--No--No--not my love--
    Yet much this heart, that strives no more, once strove
    To meet his passion--but it would not be.
    I felt--I feel--Love dwells with--with the free.
    I am a slave, a favoured slave at best,
    To share his splendour, and seem very blest!                       1110
    Oft must my soul the question undergo,
    Of--'Dost thou love?' and burn to answer, 'No!'
    Oh! hard it is that fondness to sustain,
    And struggle not to feel averse in vain;
    But harder still the heart's recoil to bear,
    And hide from one--perhaps another there.
    He takes the hand I give not--nor withhold--
    Its pulse nor checked--nor quickened--calmly cold:
    And when resigned, it drops a lifeless weight
    From one I never loved enough to hate.                             1120
    No warmth these lips return by his imprest,
    And chilled Remembrance shudders o'er the rest.
    Yes--had I ever proved that Passion's zeal,
    The change to hatred were at least to feel:
    But still--he goes unmourned--returns unsought--
    And oft when present--absent from my thought.
    Or when Reflection comes--and come it must--
    I fear that henceforth 'twill but bring disgust;
    I am his slave--but, in despite of pride,
    'Twere worse than bondage to become his bride.                     1130
    Oh! that this dotage of his breast would cease!
    Or seek another and give mine release,
    But yesterday--I could have said, to peace!
    Yes, if unwonted fondness now I feign,[hv]
    Remember--Captive! 'tis to break thy chain;
    Repay the life that to thy hand I owe;
    To give thee back to all endeared below,
    Who share such love as I can never know.
    Farewell--Morn breaks--and I must now away:
    'Twill cost me dear--but dread no death to-day!"                   1140

                    XV.

    She pressed his fettered fingers to her heart,
    And bowed her head, and turned her to depart,
    And noiseless as a lovely dream is gone.
    And was she here? and is he now alone?
    What gem hath dropped and sparkles o'er his chain?
    The tear most sacred, shed for others' pain,
    That starts at once--bright--pure--from Pity's mine,
    Already polished by the hand divine!
    Oh! too convincing--dangerously dear--
    In Woman's eye the unanswerable tear!                              1150
    That weapon of her weakness she can wield,
    To save, subdue--at once her spear and shield:
    Avoid it--Virtue ebbs and Wisdom errs,
    Too fondly gazing on that grief of hers!
    What lost a world, and bade a hero fly?
    The timid tear in Cleopatra's eye.
    Yet be the soft Triumvir's fault forgiven;
    By this--how many lose not earth--but Heaven!
    Consign their souls to Man's eternal foe,
    And seal their own to spare some Wanton's woe!                     1160

                    XVI.

    'Tis Morn--and o'er his altered features play
    The beams--without the Hope of yesterday.
    What shall he be ere night? perchance a thing
    O'er which the raven flaps her funeral wing,
    By his closed eye unheeded and unfelt;
    While sets that Sun, and dews of Evening melt,
    Chill, wet, and misty round each stiffened limb,
    Refreshing earth--reviving all but him!



                      CANTO THE THIRD.

            "Come vedi--ancor non m'abbandona"
                         Dante, _Inferno_, v. 105.

                    I.

    Slow sinks, more lovely ere his race be run,[224]
    Along Morea's hills the setting Sun;                               1170
    Not, as in Northern climes, obscurely bright,
    But one unclouded blaze of living light!
    O'er the hushed deep the yellow beam he throws,
    Gilds the green wave, that trembles as it glows.
    On old AEgina's rock, and Idra's isle,[225]
    The God of gladness sheds his parting smile;
    O'er his own regions lingering, loves to shine,
    Though there his altars are no more divine.
    Descending fast the mountain shadows kiss
    Thy glorious gulf, unconquered Salamis!                            1180
    Their azure arches through the long expanse
    More deeply purpled met his mellowing glance,
    And tenderest tints, along their summits driven,
    Mark his gay course, and own the hues of Heaven;
    Till, darkly shaded from the land and deep,
    Behind his Delphian cliff he sinks to sleep.

    On such an eve, his palest beam he cast,
    When--Athens! here thy Wisest looked his last.
    How watched thy better sons his farewell ray,
    That closed their murdered Sage's[226] latest day!                 1190
    Not yet--not yet--Sol pauses on the hill--
    The precious hour of parting lingers still;
    But sad his light to agonising eyes,
    And dark the mountain's once delightful dyes:
    Gloom o'er the lovely land he seemed to pour,
    The land, where Phoebus never frowned before:
    But ere he sunk below Cithaeron's head,
    The cup of woe was quaffed--the Spirit fled;
    The Soul of him who scorned to fear or fly--
    Who lived and died, as none can live or die!                       1200

    But lo! from high Hymettus to the plain,
    The Queen of night asserts her silent reign.[227]
    No murky vapour, herald of the storm,
    Hides her fair face, nor girds her glowing form;
    With cornice glimmering as the moon-beams play,
    There the white column greets her grateful ray,
    And bright around with quivering beams beset,
    Her emblem sparkles o'er the Minaret:
    The groves of olive scattered dark and wide
    Where meek Cephisus pours his scanty tide;                         1210
    The cypress saddening by the sacred Mosque,
    The gleaming turret of the gay Kiosk;[228]
    And, dun and sombre 'mid the holy calm,
    Near Theseus' fane yon solitary palm,
    All tinged with varied hues arrest the eye--
    And dull were his that passed him heedless by.

    Again the AEgean, heard no more afar,
    Lulls his chafed breast from elemental war;
    Again his waves in milder tints unfold
    Their long array of sapphire and of gold,                          1220
    Mixed with the shades of many a distant isle,
    That frown--where gentler Ocean seems to smile.

                    II.

    Not now my theme--why turn my thoughts to thee?
    Oh! who can look along thy native sea,
    Nor dwell upon thy name, whate'er the tale,
    So much its magic must o'er all prevail?
    Who that beheld that Sun upon thee set,
    Fair Athens! could thine evening face forget?
    Not he--whose heart nor time nor distance frees,
    Spell-bound within the clustering Cyclades!                        1230
    Nor seems this homage foreign to its strain,
    His Corsair's isle was once thine own domain--[229]
    Would that with freedom it were thine again!

                    III.

    The Sun hath sunk--and, darker than the night,
    Sinks with its beam upon the beacon height
    Medora's heart--the third day's come and gone--
    With it he comes not--sends not--faithless one!
    The wind was fair though light! and storms were none.
    Last eve Anselmo's bark returned, and yet
    His only tidings that they had not met!                            1240
    Though wild, as now, far different were the tale
    Had Conrad waited for that single sail.
    The night-breeze freshens--she that day had passed
    In watching all that Hope proclaimed a mast;
    Sadly she sate on high--Impatience bore
    At last her footsteps to the midnight shore,
    And there she wandered, heedless of the spray
    That dashed her garments oft, and warned away:
    She saw not, felt not this--nor dared depart,
    Nor deemed it cold--her chill was at her heart;                    1250
    Till grew such certainty from that suspense--
    His very Sight had shocked from life or sense!

    It came at last--a sad and shattered boat,
    Whose inmates first beheld whom first they sought;
    Some bleeding--all most wretched--these the few--
    Scarce knew they how escaped--_this_ all they knew.
    In silence, darkling, each appeared to wait
    His fellow's mournful guess at Conrad's fate:
    Something they would have said; but seemed to fear
    To trust their accents to Medora's ear.                            1260
    She saw at once, yet sunk not--trembled not--
    Beneath that grief, that loneliness of lot,
    Within that meek fair form, were feelings high,
    That deemed not till they found their energy.
    While yet was Hope they softened, fluttered, wept--
    All lost--that Softness died not--but it slept;
    And o'er its slumber rose that Strength which said,
    "With nothing left to love, there's nought to dread."
    'Tis more than Nature's--like the burning might
    Delirium gathers from the fever's height.                          1270

    "Silent you stand--nor would I hear you tell
    What--speak not--breathe not--for I know it well--
    Yet would I ask--almost my lip denies
    The--quick your answer--tell me where he lies."

    "Lady! we know not--scarce with life we fled;
    But here is one denies that he is dead:
    He saw him bound; and bleeding--but alive."

    She heard no further--'twas in vain to strive--
    So throbbed each vein--each thought--till then withstood;
    Her own dark soul--these words at once subdued:                    1280
    She totters--falls--and senseless had the wave
    Perchance but snatched her from another grave;
    But that with hands though rude, yet weeping eyes,
    They yield such aid as Pity's haste supplies:[hw]
    Dash o'er her deathlike cheek the ocean dew,
    Raise, fan, sustain--till life returns anew;
    Awake her handmaids, with the matrons leave
    That fainting form o'er which they gaze and grieve;
    Then seek Anselmo's cavern, to report
    The tale too tedious--when the triumph short.                      1290

                    IV.

    In that wild council words waxed warm and strange,[hx]
    With thoughts of ransom, rescue, and revenge;
    All, save repose or flight: still lingering there
    Breathed Conrad's spirit, and forbade despair;
    Whate'er his fate--the breasts he formed and led
    Will save him living, or appease him dead.
    Woe to his foes! there yet survive a few,
    Whose deeds are daring, as their hearts are true.

                    V.

    Within the Haram's secret chamber sate[230]
    Stern Seyd, still pondering o'er his Captive's fate;               1300
    His thoughts on love and hate alternate dwell,
    Now with Gulnare, and now in Conrad's cell;
    Here at his feet the lovely slave reclined
    Surveys his brow--would soothe his gloom of mind;
    While many an anxious glance her large dark eye
    Sends in its idle search for sympathy,
    _His_ only bends in seeming o'er his beads,[231]
    But inly views his victim as he bleeds.

    "Pacha! the day is thine; and on thy crest
    Sits Triumph--Conrad taken--fall'n the rest!                       1310
    His doom is fixed--he dies; and well his fate
    Was earned--yet much too worthless for thy hate:
    Methinks, a short release, for ransom told[hy]
    With all his treasure, not unwisely sold;
    Report speaks largely of his pirate-hoard--
    Would that of this my Pacha were the lord!
    While baffled, weakened by this fatal fray--
    Watched--followed--he were then an easier prey;
    But once cut off--the remnant of his band
    Embark their wealth, and seek a safer strand."     1320

    "Gulnare!--if for each drop of blood a gem
    Where offered rich as Stamboul's diadem;
    If for each hair of his a massy mine
    Of virgin ore should supplicating shine;
    If all our Arab tales divulge or dream
    Of wealth were here--that gold should not redeem!
    It had not now redeemed a single hour,
    But that I know him fettered, in my power;
    And, thirsting for revenge, I ponder still
    On pangs that longest rack--and latest kill."      1330

    "Nay, Seyd! I seek not to restrain thy rage,
    Too justly moved for Mercy to assuage;
    My thoughts were only to secure for thee
    His riches--thus released, he were not free:
    Disabled--shorn of half his might and band,
    His capture could but wait thy first command."

    "His capture _could!_--and shall I then resign
    One day to him--the wretch already mine?
    Release my foe!--at whose remonstrance?--thine!
    Fair suitor!--to thy virtuous gratitude,                           1340
    That thus repays this Giaour's relenting mood,
    Which thee and thine alone of all could spare--
    No doubt, regardless--if the prize were fair--
    My thanks and praise alike are due--now hear!
    I have a counsel for thy gentler ear:
    I do mistrust thee, Woman! and each word
    Of thine stamps truth on all Suspicion heard.[hz]
    Borne in his arms through fire from yon Serai--
    Say, wert thou lingering there with him to fly?
    Thou need'st not answer--thy confession speaks,                    1350
    Already reddening on thy guilty cheeks:
    Then--lovely Dame--bethink thee! and beware:
    'Tis not _his_ life alone may claim such care!
    Another word and--nay--I need no more.
    Accursed was the moment when he bore
    Thee from the flames, which better far--but no--
    I then had mourned thee with a lover's woe--
    Now 'tis thy lord that warns--deceitful thing!
    Know'st thou that I can clip thy wanton wing?
    In words alone I am not wont to chafe:                             1360
    Look to thyself--nor deem thy falsehood safe!"

    He rose--and slowly, sternly thence withdrew,
    Rage in his eye, and threats in his adieu:
    Ah! little recked that Chief of womanhood--
    Which frowns ne'er quelled, nor menaces subdued;
    And little deemed he what thy heart, Gulnare!
    When soft could feel--and when incensed could dare!
    His doubts appeared to wrong--nor yet she knew
    How deep the root from whence Compassion grew--
    She was a slave--from such may captives claim                      1370
    A fellow-feeling, differing but in name;
    Still half unconscious--heedless of his wrath,
    Again she ventured on the dangerous path,
    Again his rage repelled--until arose
    That strife of thought, the source of Woman's woes!

                    VI.

    Meanwhile--long--anxious--weary--still the same
    Rolled day and night: his soul could Terror tame--
    This fearful interval of doubt and dread,
    When every hour might doom him worse than dead;[ia]
    When every step that echoed by the gate,                           1380
    Might entering lead where axe and stake await;
    When every voice that grated on his ear
    Might be the last that he could ever hear;
    Could Terror tame--that Spirit stern and high
    Had proved unwilling as unfit to die;
    'Twas worn--perhaps decayed--yet silent bore
    That conflict, deadlier far than all before:
    The heat of fight, the hurry of the gale,
    Leave scarce one thought inert enough to quail:
    But bound and fixed in fettered solitude,                          1390
    To pine, the prey of every changing mood;
    To gaze on thine own heart--and meditate
    Irrevocable faults, and coming fate--
    Too late the last to shun--the first to mend--
    To count the hours that struggle to thine end,
    With not a friend to animate and tell
    To other ears that Death became thee well;
    Around thee foes to forge the ready lie,
    And blot Life's latest scene with calumny;
    Before thee tortures, which the Soul can dare,                     1400
    Yet doubts how well the shrinking flesh may bear;
    But deeply feels a single cry would shame,
    To Valour's praise thy last and dearest claim;
    The life thou leav'st below, denied above
    By kind monopolists of heavenly love;
    And more than doubtful Paradise--thy Heaven
    Of earthly hope--thy loved one from thee riven.
    Such were the thoughts that outlaw must sustain,
    And govern pangs surpassing mortal pain:
    And those sustained he--boots it well or ill?                      1410
    Since not to sink beneath, is something still!

                    VII.

    The first day passed--he saw not her--Gulnare--
    The second, third--and still she came not there;
    But what her words avouched, her charms had done,
    Or else he had not seen another Sun.
    The fourth day rolled along, and with the night
    Came storm and darkness in their mingling might.
    Oh! how he listened to the rushing deep,
    That ne'er till now so broke upon his sleep;
    And his wild Spirit wilder wishes sent,                            1420
    Roused by the roar of his own element!
    Oft had he ridden on that winged wave,
    And loved its roughness for the speed it gave;
    And now its dashing echoed on his ear,
    A long known voice--alas! too vainly near!
    Loud sung the wind above; and, doubly loud,
    Shook o'er his turret cell the thunder-cloud;[232]
    And flashed the lightning by the latticed bar,
    To him more genial than the Midnight Star:
    Close to the glimmering grate he dragged his chain,                1430
    And hoped _that_ peril might not prove in vain.
    He rais'd his iron hand to Heaven, and prayed
    One pitying flash to mar the form it made:
    His steel and impious prayer attract alike--
    The storm rolled onward, and disdained to strike;
    Its peal waxed fainter--ceased--he felt alone,
    As if some faithless friend had spurned his groan!

                    VIII.

    The midnight passed, and to the massy door
    A light step came--it paused--it moved once more;
    Slow turns the grating bolt and sullen key:                        1440
    'Tis as his heart foreboded--that fair She!
    Whate'er her sins, to him a Guardian Saint,
    And beauteous still as hermit's hope can paint;
    Yet changed since last within that cell she came,
    More pale her cheek, more tremulous her frame:
    On him she cast her dark and hurried eye,
    Which spoke before her accents--"Thou must die!
    Yes, thou must die--there is but one resource,
    The last--the worst--if torture were not worse."

    "Lady! I look to none; my lips proclaim                            1450
    What last proclaimed they--Conrad still the same:
    Why should'st thou seek an outlaw's life to spare,
    And change the sentence I deserve to bear?
    Well have I earned--nor here alone--the meed
    Of Seyd's revenge, by many a lawless deed."

    "Why should I seek? because--Oh! did'st thou not
    Redeem my life from worse than Slavery's lot?
    Why should I seek?--hath Misery made thee blind
    To the fond workings of a woman's mind?
    And must I say?--albeit my heart rebel                             1460
    With all that Woman feels, but should not tell--
    Because--despite thy crimes--that heart is moved:
    It feared thee--thanked thee--pitied--maddened--loved.
    Reply not, tell not now thy tale again,
    Thou lov'st another--and I love in vain:
    Though fond as mine her bosom, form more fair,
    I rush through peril which she would not dare.
    If that thy heart to hers were truly dear,
    Were I thine own--thou wert not lonely here:
    An outlaw's spouse--and leave her Lord to roam!                    1470
    What hath such gentle dame to do with home?
    But speak not now--o'er thine and o'er my head
    Hangs the keen sabre by a single thread;[ib]
    If thou hast courage still, and would'st be free,
    Receive this poniard--rise and follow me!"

    "Aye--in my chains! my steps will gently tread,
    With these adornments, o'er such slumbering head!
    Thou hast forgot--is this a garb for flight?
    Or is that instrument more fit for fight?"

    "Misdoubting Corsair! I have gained the guard,                     1480
    Ripe for revolt, and greedy for reward.
    A single word of mine removes that chain:
    Without some aid how here could I remain?
    Well, since we met, hath sped my busy time,
    If in aught evil, for thy sake the crime:
    The crime--'tis none to punish those of Seyd.
    That hatred tyrant, Conrad--he must bleed!
    I see thee shudder, but my soul is changed--
    Wronged--spurned--reviled--and it shall be avenged--
    Accused of what till now my heart disdained--                      1490
    Too faithful, though to bitter bondage chained.
    Yes, smile!--but he had little cause to sneer,
    I was not treacherous then, nor thou too dear:
    But he has said it--and the jealous well,--
    Those tyrants--teasing--tempting to rebel,--
    Deserve the fate their fretting lips foretell.
    I never loved--he bought me--somewhat high--
    Since with me came a heart he could not buy.
    I was a slave unmurmuring; he hath said,
    But for his rescue I with thee had fled.                           1500
    'Twas false thou know'st--but let such Augurs rue,
    Their words are omens Insult renders true.
    Nor was thy respite granted to my prayer;
    This fleeting grace was only to prepare
    New torments for thy life, and my despair.
    Mine too he threatens; but his dotage still
    Would fain reserve me for his lordly will:
    When wearier of these fleeting charms and me,
    There yawns the sack--and yonder rolls the sea!
    What, am I then a toy for dotard's play,                           1510
    To wear but till the gilding frets away?
    I saw thee--loved thee--owe thee all--would save,
    If but to show how grateful is a slave.
    But had he not thus menaced fame and life,--
    And well he keeps his oaths pronounced in strife--
    I still had saved thee--but the Pacha spared:
    Now I am all thine own--for all prepared:
    Thou lov'st me not--nor know'st--or but the worst.
    Alas! _this_ love--_that_ hatred--are the first--
    Oh! could'st thou prove my truth, thou would'st not start,         1520
    Nor fear the fire that lights an Eastern heart;
    'Tis now the beacon of thy safety--now
    It points within the port a Mainote prow:
    But in one chamber, where our path must lead,
    There sleeps--he must not wake--the oppressor Seyd!"

    "Gulnare--Gulnare--I never felt till now
    My abject fortune, withered fame so low:
    Seyd is mine enemy; had swept my band
    From earth with ruthless but with open hand,
    And therefore came I, in my bark of war,                           1530
    To smite the smiter with the scimitar;
    Such is my weapon--not the secret knife;
    Who spares a Woman's seeks not Slumber's life.
    Thine saved I gladly, Lady--not for this;
    Let me not deem that mercy shown amiss.
    Now fare thee well--more peace be with thy breast!
    Night wears apace, my last of earthly rest!"[ic]

    "Rest! rest! by sunrise must thy sinews shake,
    And thy limbs writhe around the ready stake,
    I heard the order--saw--I will not see--                           1540
    If thou wilt perish, I will fall with thee.
    My life--my love--my hatred--all below
    Are on this cast--Corsair! 'tis but a blow!
    Without it flight were idle--how evade
    His sure pursuit?--my wrongs too unrepaid,
    My youth disgraced--the long, long wasted years,
    One blow shall cancel with our future fears;
    But since the dagger suits thee less than brand,
    I'll try the firmness of a female hand.
    The guards are gained--one moment all were o'er--                  1550
    Corsair! we meet in safety or no more;
    If errs my feeble hand, the morning cloud
    Will hover o'er thy scaffold, and my shroud."

                    IX.

    She turned, and vanished ere he could reply,
    But his glance followed far with eager eye;
    And gathering, as he could, the links that bound
    His form, to curl their length, and curb their sound,
    Since bar and bolt no more his steps preclude,
    He, fast as fettered limbs allow, pursued.
    'Twas dark and winding, and he knew not where                      1560
    That passage led; nor lamp nor guard was there:
    He sees a dusky glimmering--shall he seek
    Or shun that ray so indistinct and weak?
    Chance guides his steps--a freshness seems to bear
    Full on his brow as if from morning air;
    He reached an open gallery--on his eye
    Gleamed the last star of night, the clearing sky:
    Yet scarcely heeded these--another light
    From a lone chamber struck upon his sight.
    Towards it he moved; a scarcely closing door                       1570
    Revealed the ray within, but nothing more.
    With hasty step a figure outward passed,
    Then paused, and turned--and paused--'tis She at last!
    No poniard in that hand, nor sign of ill--
    "Thanks to that softening heart--she could not kill!"
    Again he looked, the wildness of her eye
    Starts from the day abrupt and fearfully.
    She stopped--threw back her dark far-floating hair,
    That nearly veiled her face and bosom fair,
    As if she late had bent her leaning head                           1580
    Above some object of her doubt or dread.
    They meet--upon her brow--unknown--forgot--
    Her hurrying hand had left--'twas but a spot--
    Its hue was all he saw, and scarce withstood--
    Oh! slight but certain pledge of crime--'tis Blood!

                    X.

    He had seen battle--he had brooded lone
    O'er promised pangs to sentenced Guilt foreshown;
    He had been tempted--chastened--and the chain
    Yet on his arms might ever there remain:
    But ne'er from strife--captivity--remorse--                        1590
    From all his feelings in their inmost force--
    So thrilled, so shuddered every creeping vein,
    As now they froze before that purple stain.
    That spot of blood, that light but guilty streak,
    Had banished all the beauty from her cheek!
    Blood he had viewed--could view unmoved--but then
    It flowed in combat, or was shed by men![id]

                    XI.

    "'Tis done--he nearly waked--but it is done.
    Corsair! he perished--thou art dearly won.
    All words would now be vain--away--away!                           1600
    Our bark is tossing--'tis already day.
    The few gained over, now are wholly mine,
    And these thy yet surviving band shall join:
    Anon my voice shall vindicate my hand,
    When once our sail forsakes this hated strand."

                    XII.

    She clapped her hands, and through the gallery pour,
    Equipped for flight, her vassals--Greek and Moor;
    Silent but quick they stoop, his chains unbind;
    Once more his limbs are free as mountain wind!
    But on his heavy heart such sadness sate,                          1610
    As if they there transferred that iron weight.
    No words are uttered--at her sign, a door
    Reveals the secret passage to the shore;
    The city lies behind--they speed, they reach
    The glad waves dancing on the yellow beach;
    And Conrad following, at her beck, obeyed,
    Nor cared he now if rescued or betrayed;
    Resistance were as useless as if Seyd
    Yet lived to view the doom his ire decreed.

                    XIII.

    Embarked--the sail unfurled--the light breeze blew--               1620
    How much had Conrad's memory to review![ie]
    Sunk he in contemplation, till the Cape
    Where last he anchored reared its giant shape.
    Ah!--since that fatal night, though brief the time,
    Had swept an age of terror, grief, and crime.
    As its far shadow frowned above the mast,
    He veiled his face, and sorrowed as he passed;
    He thought of all--Gonsalvo and his band,
    His fleeting triumph and his failing hand;
    He thought on her afar, his lonely bride:                          1630
    He turned and saw--Gulnare, the Homicide!

                    XIV.

    She watched his features till she could not bear
    Their freezing aspect and averted air;
    And that strange fierceness foreign to her eye
    Fell quenched in tears, too late to shed or dry.[if]
    She knelt beside him and his hand she pressed,
    "Thou may'st forgive though Allah's self detest;
    But for that deed of darkness what wert thou?
    Reproach me--but not yet--Oh! spare me _now!_
    I am not what I seem--this fearful night                           1640
    My brain bewildered--do not madden quite!
    If I had never loved--though less my guilt--
    Thou hadst not lived to--hate me--if thou wilt."

                    XV.

    She wrongs his thoughts--they more himself upbraid
    Than her--though undesigned--the wretch he made;
    But speechless all, deep, dark, and unexprest,
    They bleed within that silent cell--his breast.
    Still onward, fair the breeze, nor rough the surge,
    The blue waves sport around the stern they urge;
    Far on the Horizon's verge appears a speck,                        1650
    A spot--a mast--a sail--an armed deck!
    Their little bark her men of watch descry,
    And ampler canvass woos the wind from high;
    She bears her down majestically near,
    Speed on her prow, and terror in her tier;[ig][233]
    A flash is seen--the ball beyond her bow
    Booms harmless, hissing to the deep below.
    Up rose keen Conrad from his silent trance,
    A long, long absent gladness in his glance;
    "'Tis mine--my blood-rag flag! again--again--                      1660
    I am not all deserted on the main!"
    They own the signal, answer to the hail,
    Hoist out the boat at once, and slacken sail.
    "'Tis Conrad! Conrad!" shouting from the deck,
    Command nor Duty could their transport check!
    With light alacrity and gaze of Pride,
    They view him mount once more his vessel's side;
    A smile relaxing in each rugged face,
    Their arms can scarce forbear a rough embrace.
    He, half forgetting danger and defeat,                             1670
    Returns their greeting as a Chief may greet,
    Wrings with a cordial grasp Anselmo's hand,
    And feels he yet can conquer and command!

                    XVI.

    These greetings o'er, the feelings that o'erflow,
    Yet grieve to win him back without a blow;
    They sailed prepared for vengeance--had they known
    A woman's hand secured that deed her own,
    She were their Queen--less scrupulous are they
    Than haughty Conrad how they win their way.
    With many an asking smile, and wondering stare,                    1680
    They whisper round, and gaze upon Gulnare;
    And her, at once above--beneath her sex,
    Whom blood appalled not, their regards perplex.[ih]
    To Conrad turns her faint imploring eye,
    She drops her veil, and stands in silence by;
    Her arms are meekly folded on that breast,
    Which--Conrad safe--to Fate resigned the rest.
    Though worse than frenzy could that bosom fill,
    Extreme in love or hate, in good or ill,
    The worst of crimes had left her Woman still!                      1690

                    XVII.

    This Conrad marked, and felt--ah! could he less?--
    Hate of that deed--but grief for her distress;
    What she has done no tears can wash away,
    And Heaven must punish on its angry day:
    But--it was done: he knew, whate'er her guilt,
    For him that poniard smote, that blood was spilt;
    And he was free!--and she for him had given
    Her all on earth, and more than all in heaven![234]
    And now he turned him to that dark-eyed slave
    Whose brow was bowed beneath the glance he gave,                   1700
    Who now seemed changed and humbled, faint and meek,
    But varying oft the colour of her cheek
    To deeper shades of paleness--all its red
    That fearful spot which stained it from the dead!
    He took that hand--it trembled--now too late--
    So soft in love--so wildly nerved in hate;
    He clasped that hand--it trembled--and his own
    Had lost its firmness, and his voice its tone.
    "Gulnare!"--but she replied not--"dear Gulnare!"[ii]
    She raised her eye--her only answer there--                        1710
    At once she sought and sunk in his embrace:
    If he had driven her from that resting-place,
    His had been more or less than mortal heart,
    But--good or ill--it bade her not depart.
    Perchance, but for the bodings of his breast,
    His latest virtue then had joined the rest.
    Yet even Medora might forgive the kiss[ij]
    That asked from form so fair no more than this,
    The first, the last that Frailty stole from Faith--
    To lips where Love had lavished all his breath,                    1720
    To lips--whose broken sighs such fragrance fling,
    As he had fanned them freshly with his wing![ik]

                    XVIII.

    They gain by twilight's hour their lonely isle.
    To them the very rocks appear to smile;
    The haven hums with many a cheering sound,
    The beacons blaze their wonted stations round,
    The boats are darting o'er the curly bay,
    And sportive Dolphins bend them through the spray;
    Even the hoarse sea-bird's shrill, discordant shriek,
    Greets like the welcome of his tuneless beak!                      1730
    Beneath each lamp that through its lattice gleams,
    Their fancy paints the friends that trim the beams.
    Oh! what can sanctify the joys of home,
    Like Hope's gay glance from Ocean's troubled foam?[il]

                    XIX.

    The lights are high on beacon and from bower,
    And 'midst them Conrad seeks Medora's tower:
    He looks in vain--'tis strange--and all remark,
    Amid so many, hers alone is dark.
    'Tis strange--of yore its welcome never failed,
    Nor now, perchance, extinguished--only veiled.                     1740
    With the first boat descends he for the shore,
    And looks impatient on the lingering oar.
    Oh! for a wing beyond the falcon's flight,
    To bear him like an arrow to that height!
    With the first pause the resting rowers gave,
    He waits not--looks not--leaps into the wave,
    Strives through the surge, bestrides the beach, and high
    Ascends the path familiar to his eye.

    He reached his turret door--he paused--no sound
    Broke from within; and all was night around.                       1750
    He knocked, and loudly--footstep nor reply
    Announced that any heard or deemed him nigh:
    He knocked, but faintly--for his trembling hand
    Refused to aid his heavy heart's demand.
    The portal opens--'tis a well known face--
    But not the form he panted to embrace.
    Its lips are silent--twice his own essayed,
    And failed to frame the question they delayed;
    He snatched the lamp--its light will answer all--
    It quits his grasp, expiring in the fall.                          1760
    He would not wait for that reviving ray--
    As soon could he have lingered there for day;
    But, glimmering through the dusky corridor,
    Another chequers o'er the shadowed floor;
    His steps the chamber gain--his eyes behold
    All that his heart believed not--yet foretold!

                    XX.

    He turned not--spoke not--sunk not--fixed his look,
    And set the anxious frame that lately shook:
    He gazed--how long we gaze despite of pain,
    And know, but dare not own, we gaze in vain!                       1770
    In life itself she was so still and fair,
    That Death with gentler aspect withered there;
    And the cold flowers[235] her colder hand contained,
    In that last grasp as tenderly were strained
    As if she scarcely felt, but feigned a sleep--
    And made it almost mockery yet to weep:
    The long dark lashes fringed her lids of snow,
    And veiled--Thought shrinks from all that lurked below--Oh!
    o'er the eye Death most exerts his might,[236]
    And hurls the Spirit from her throne of light;                     1780
    Sinks those blue orbs in that long last eclipse,
    But spares, as yet, the charm around her lips--
    Yet, yet they seem as they forebore to smile,
    And wished repose,--but only for a while;
    But the white shroud, and each extended tress,
    Long, fair--but spread in utter lifelessness,
    Which, late the sport of every summer wind,
    Escaped the baffled wreath that strove to bind;[im]
    These--and the pale pure cheek, became the bier--
    But She is nothing--wherefore is he here?                          1790

                    XXI.

    He asked no question--all were answered now
    By the first glance on that still, marble brow.[in]
    It was enough--she died--what recked it how?
    The love of youth, the hope of better years,
    The source of softest wishes, tenderest fears,
    The only living thing he could not hate,
    Was reft at once--and he deserved his fate,
    But did not feel it less;--the Good explore,
    For peace, those realms where Guilt can never soar:
    The proud, the wayward--who have fixed below                       1800
    Their joy, and find this earth enough for woe,
    Lose in that one their all--perchance a mite--
    But who in patience parts with all delight?
    Full many a stoic eye and aspect stern
    Mask hearts where Grief hath little left to learn;
    And many a withering thought lies hid, not lost,
    In smiles that least befit who wear them most.

                    XXII.

    By those, that deepest feel, is ill exprest
    The indistinctness of the suffering breast;
    Where thousand thoughts begin to end in one,                       1810
    Which seeks from all the refuge found in none;
    No words suffice the secret soul to show,
    For Truth denies all eloquence to Woe.
    On Conrad's stricken soul Exhaustion prest,
    And Stupor almost lulled it into rest;
    So feeble now--his mother's softness crept
    To those wild eyes, which like an infant's wept:
    It was the very weakness of his brain,
    Which thus confessed without relieving pain.
    None saw his trickling tears--perchance, if seen,                  1820
    That useless flood of grief had never been:
    Nor long they flowed--he dried them to depart,
    In helpless--hopeless--brokenness of heart:
    The Sun goes forth, but Conrad's day is dim:
    And the night cometh--ne'er to pass from him.[io]
    There is no darkness like the cloud of mind,
    On Grief's vain eye--the blindest of the blind!
    Which may not--dare not see--but turns aside
    To blackest shade--nor will endure a guide!

                    XXIII.[237]

    His heart was formed for softness--warped to wrong,                1830
    Betrayed too early, and beguiled too long;
    Each feeling pure--as falls the dropping dew
    Within the grot--like that had hardened too;
    Less clear, perchance, its earthly trials passed,
    But sunk, and chilled, and petrified at last.[238]
    Yet tempests wear, and lightning cleaves the rock;
    If such his heart, so shattered it the shock.
    There grew one flower beneath its rugged brow,
    Though dark the shade--it sheltered--saved till now.
    The thunder came--that bolt hath blasted both,                     1840
    The Granite's firmness, and the Lily's growth:
    The gentle plant hath left no leaf to tell
    Its tale, but shrunk and withered where it fell;
    And of its cold protector, blacken round
    But shivered fragments on the barren ground!

                    XXIV.

    'Tis morn--to venture on his lonely hour
    Few dare; though now Anselmo sought his tower.
    He was not there, nor seen along the shore;
    Ere night, alarmed, their isle is traversed o'er:
    Another morn--another bids them seek,                              1850
    And shout his name till Echo waxeth weak;
    Mount--grotto--cavern--valley searched in vain,
    They find on shore a sea-boat's broken chain:
    Their hope revives--they follow o'er the main.
    'Tis idle all--moons roll on moons away,
    And Conrad comes not, came not since that day:
    Nor trace nor tidings of his doom declare
    Where lives his grief, or perished his despair!
    Long mourned his band whom none could mourn beside;
    And fair the monument they gave his Bride:                         1860
    For him they raise not the recording stone--
    His death yet dubious, deeds too widely known;
    He left a Corsair's name to other times,
    Linked with one virtue, and a thousand crimes.[239]





                ODE TO NAPOLEON BUONAPARTE.

                    I.

    'Tis done--but yesterday a King!
      And armed with Kings to strive--
    And now thou art a nameless thing:
      So abject--yet alive!
    Is this the man of thousand thrones,
    Who strewed our earth with hostile bones,
      And can he thus survive?[243]
    Since he, miscalled the Morning Star,[244]
    Nor man nor fiend hath fallen so far.

                    II.[245]

    Ill-minded man! why scourge thy kind
      Who bowed so low the knee?
    By gazing on thyself grown blind,
      Thou taught'st the rest to see.
    With might unquestioned,--power to save,--
    Thine only gift hath been the grave
      To those that worshipped thee;
    Nor till thy fall could mortals guess
    Ambition's less than littleness!

                    III.

    Thanks for that lesson--it will teach
      To after-warriors more
    Than high Philosophy can preach,
      And vainly preached before.
    That spell upon the minds of men[246]
    Breaks never to unite again,
      That led them to adore
    Those Pagod things of sabre-sway,
    With fronts of brass, and feet of clay.

                    IV.

    The triumph, and the vanity,
      The rapture of the strife--[247]
    The earthquake-voice of Victory,
      To thee the breath of life;
    The sword, the sceptre, and that sway
    Which man seemed made but to obey,
      Wherewith renown was rife--
    All quelled!--Dark Spirit! what must be
    The madness of thy memory!

                    V.[248]

    The Desolator desolate![249]
      The Victor overthrown!
    The Arbiter of others' fate
      A Suppliant for his own!
    Is it some yet imperial hope
    That with such change can calmly cope?
      Or dread of death alone?
    To die a Prince--or live a slave--
    Thy choice is most ignobly brave!

                    VI.

    He who of old would rend the oak,
      Dreamed not of the rebound;[250]
    Chained by the trunk he vainly broke--
      Alone--how looked he round?
    Thou, in the sternness of thy strength,
    An equal deed hast done at length.
      And darker fate hast found:
    He fell, the forest prowlers' prey;
    But thou must eat thy heart away!

                    VII.

    The Roman,[251] when his burning heart
      Was slaked with blood of Rome,
    Threw down the dagger--dared depart,
      In savage grandeur, home.--
    He dared depart in utter scorn
    Of men that such a yoke had borne,
      Yet left him such a doom!
    His only glory was that hour
    Of self-upheld abandoned power.

                    VIII.

    The Spaniard, when the lust of sway
      Had lost its quickening spell,[252]
    Cast crowns for rosaries away,
      An empire for a cell;
    A strict accountant of his beads,
    A subtle disputant on creeds,
      His dotage trifled well:[253]
    Yet better had he neither known
    A bigot's shrine, nor despot's throne.

                    IX.

    But thou--from thy reluctant hand
      The thunderbolt is wrung--
    Too late thou leav'st the high command
      To which thy weakness clung;
    All Evil Spirit as thou art,
    It is enough to grieve the heart
      To see thine own unstrung;
    To think that God's fair world hath been
    The footstool of a thing so mean;

                    X.

    And Earth hath spilt her blood for him,
      Who thus can hoard his own!
    And Monarchs bowed the trembling limb,
      And thanked him for a throne!
    Fair Freedom! we may hold thee dear,
    When thus thy mightiest foes their fear
      In humblest guise have shown.
    Oh! ne'er may tyrant leave behind
    A brighter name to lure mankind!

                    XI.

    Thine evil deeds are writ in gore,
      Nor written thus in vain--
    Thy triumphs tell of fame no more,
      Or deepen every stain:
    If thou hadst died as Honour dies,
    Some new Napoleon might arise,
      To shame the world again--
    But who would soar the solar height,
    To set in such a starless night?[ip]

                    XII.

    Weigh'd in the balance, hero dust
      Is vile as vulgar clay;[iq]
    Thy scales, Mortality! are just
      To all that pass away:
    But yet methought the living great
    Some higher sparks should animate,
      To dazzle and dismay:
    Nor deem'd Contempt could thus make mirth
    Of these, the Conquerors of the earth.

                    XIII.[254]

    And she, proud Austria's mournful flower,
      Thy still imperial bride;
    How bears her breast the torturing hour?
      Still clings she to thy side?
    Must she too bend, must she too share
    Thy late repentance, long despair,
      Thou throneless Homicide?
    If still she loves thee, hoard that gem,--
    'Tis worth thy vanished diadem![255]

                    XIV.

    Then haste thee to thy sullen Isle,
      And gaze upon the sea;[ir]
    That element may meet thy smile--
      It ne'er was ruled by thee!
    Or trace with thine all idle hand[is]
    In loitering mood upon the sand
      That Earth is now as free!
    That Corinth's pedagogue[256] hath now
    Transferred his by-word to thy brow.

                    XV.

    Thou Timour! in his captive's cage[257][it]
      What thoughts will there be thine,
    While brooding in thy prisoned rage?
      But one--"The world _was_ mine!"
    Unless, like he of Babylon,[258]
    All sense is with thy sceptre gone,[259]
      Life will not long confine
    That spirit poured so widely forth--
    So long obeyed--so little worth!

                    XVI.

    Or, like the thief of fire from heaven,[260]
      Wilt thou withstand the shock?
    And share with him, the unforgiven,
      His vulture and his rock!
    Foredoomed by God--by man accurst,[iu]
    And that last act, though not thy worst,
      The very Fiend's arch mock;[261]
    He in his fall preserved his pride,
    And, if a mortal, had as proudly died![iv][262]

                    XVII.

    There was a day--there was an hour,
      While earth was Gaul's--Gaul thine--[iw]
    When that immeasurable power
      Unsated to resign
    Had been an act of purer fame
    Than gathers round Marengo's name
      And gilded thy decline,
    Through the long twilight of all time,
    Despite some passing clouds of crime.

                    XVIII.

    But thou forsooth must be a King
      And don the purple vest,
    As if that foolish robe could wring
      Remembrance from thy breast.
    Where is that faded garment? where[ix]
    The gewgaws thou wert fond to wear,
      The star, the string, the crest?[iy][263]
    Vain froward child of Empire! say,
    Are all thy playthings snatched away?

                    XIX.

    Where may the wearied eye repose[iz]
      When gazing on the Great;
    Where neither guilty glory glows,
      Nor despicable state?
    Yes--One--the first--the last--the best--
    The Cincinnatus of the West,
      Whom Envy dared not hate,
    Bequeathed the name of Washington,
    To make man blush there was but one![ja][264]





                                LARA.[jb]



                   CANTO THE FIRST.[265]

                    I.

    The Serfs[266] are glad through Lara's wide domain,[267]
    And Slavery half forgets her feudal chain;
    He, their unhoped, but unforgotten lord,
    The long self-exiled Chieftain, is restored:
    There be bright faces in the busy hall,
    Bowls on the board, and banners on the wall;
    Far checkering o'er the pictured window, plays
    The unwonted faggot's hospitable blaze;
    And gay retainers gather round the hearth,
    With tongues all loudness, and with eyes all mirth.                  10

                    II.

    The Chief of Lara is returned again:
    And why had Lara crossed the bounding main?
    Left by his Sire, too young such loss to know,[268]
    Lord of himself,--that heritage of woe,
    That fearful empire which the human breast
    But holds to rob the heart within of rest!--
    With none to check, and few to point in time
    The thousand paths that slope the way to crime;
    Then, when he most required commandment, then
    Had Lara's daring boyhood governed men.[jc]                          20
    It skills not, boots not step by step to trace
    His youth through all the mazes of its race;
    Short was the course his restlessness had run,[jd]
    But long enough to leave him half undone.

                    III.

    And Lara left in youth his father-land;
    But from the hour he waved his parting hand
    Each trace waxed fainter of his course, till all
    Had nearly ceased his memory to recall.
    His sire was dust, his vassals could declare,
    'Twas all they knew, that Lara was not there;                        30
    Nor sent, nor came he, till conjecture grew
    Cold in the many, anxious in the few.
    His hall scarce echoes with his wonted name,
    His portrait darkens in its fading frame,
    Another chief consoled his destined bride,[je]
    The young forgot him, and the old had died;[jf]
    "Yet doth he live!" exclaims the impatient heir,
    And sighs for sables which he must not wear.[jg]
    A hundred scutcheons deck with gloomy grace
    The Laras' last and longest dwelling-place;                          40
    But one is absent from the mouldering file,
    That now were welcome in that Gothic pile.[jh]

                    IV.

    He comes at last in sudden loneliness,
    And whence they know not, why they need not guess;
    They more might marvel, when the greeting's o'er
    Not that he came, but came not long before:
    No train is his beyond a single page,
    Of foreign aspect, and of tender age.
    Years had rolled on, and fast they speed away
    To those that wander as to those that stay;                          50
    But lack of tidings from another clime
    Had lent a flagging wing to weary Time.
    They see, they recognise, yet almost deem
    The present dubious, or the past a dream.

    He lives, nor yet is past his Manhood's prime,
    Though seared by toil, and something touched by Time;
    His faults, whate'er they were, if scarce forgot,
    Might be untaught him by his varied lot;
    Nor good nor ill of late were known, his name
    Might yet uphold his patrimonial fame:                               60
    His soul in youth was haughty, but his sins[269]
    No more than pleasure from the stripling wins;
    And such, if not yet hardened in their course,
    Might be redeemed, nor ask a long remorse.

                    V.

    And they indeed were changed--'tis quickly seen,
    Whate'er he be, 'twas not what he had been:
    That brow in furrowed lines had fixed at last,
    And spake of passions, but of passion past:
    The pride, but not the fire, of early days,
    Coldness of mien, and carelessness of praise;                        70
    A high demeanour, and a glance that took
    Their thoughts from others by a single look;
    And that sarcastic levity of tongue,
    The stinging of a heart the world hath stung,
    That darts in seeming playfulness around,
    And makes those feel that will not own the wound;
    All these seemed his, and something more beneath
    Than glance could well reveal, or accent breathe.
    Ambition, Glory, Love, the common aim,
    That some can conquer, and that all would claim,                     80
    Within his breast appeared no more to strive,
    Yet seemed as lately they had been alive;
    And some deep feeling it were vain to trace
    At moments lightened o'er his livid face.

                    VI.

    Not much he loved long question of the past,
    Nor told of wondrous wilds, and deserts vast,
    In those far lands where he had wandered lone,
    And--as himself would have it seem--unknown:
    Yet these in vain his eye could scarcely scan,
    Nor glean experience from his fellow man;                            90
    But what he had beheld he shunned to show,
    As hardly worth a stranger's care to know;
    If still more prying such inquiry grew,
    His brow fell darker, and his words more few.

                    VII.

    Not unrejoiced to see him once again,
    Warm was his welcome to the haunts of men;
    Born of high lineage, linked in high command,
    He mingled with the Magnates of his land;
    Joined the carousals of the great and gay,
    And saw them smile or sigh their hours away;                        100
    But still he only saw, and did not share,
    The common pleasure or the general care;
    He did not follow what they all pursued
    With hope still baffled still to be renewed;
    Nor shadowy Honour, nor substantial Gain,
    Nor Beauty's preference, and the rival's pain:
    Around him some mysterious circle thrown
    Repelled approach, and showed him still alone;
    Upon his eye sat something of reproof,
    That kept at least Frivolity aloof;                                 110
    And things more timid that beheld him near
    In silence gazed, or whispered mutual fear;
    And they the wiser, friendlier few confessed
    They deemed him better than his air expressed.

                    VIII.

    Twas strange--in youth all action and all life,
    Burning for pleasure, not averse from strife;
    Woman--the Field--the Ocean, all that gave
    Promise of gladness, peril of a grave,
    In turn he tried--he ransacked all below,
    And found his recompense in joy or woe,                             120
    No tame, trite medium; for his feelings sought
    In that intenseness an escape from thought:[ji]
    The Tempest of his Heart in scorn had gazed
    On that the feebler Elements hath raised;
    The Rapture of his Heart had looked on high,
    And asked if greater dwelt beyond the sky:
    Chained to excess, the slave of each extreme,
    How woke he from the wildness of that dream!
    Alas! he told not--but he did awake
    To curse the withered heart that would not break.                   130

                    IX.

    Books, for his volume heretofore was Man,
    With eye more curious he appeared to scan,
    And oft in sudden mood, for many a day,
    From all communion he would start away:
    And then, his rarely called attendants said,
    Through night's long hours would sound his hurried tread
    O'er the dark gallery, where his fathers frowned
    In rude but antique portraiture around:
    They heard, but whispered--"_that_ must not be known--
    The sound of words less earthly than his own.[jj]                   140
    Yes, they who chose might smile, but some had seen
    They scarce knew what, but more than should have been.
    Why gazed he so upon the ghastly head[270]
    Which hands profane had gathered from the dead,
    That still beside his opened volume lay,
    As if to startle all save him away?
    Why slept he not when others were at rest?
    Why heard no music, and received no guest?
    All was not well, they deemed--but where the wrong?[271]
    Some knew perchance--but 'twere a tale too long;                    150
    And such besides were too discreetly wise,
    To more than hint their knowledge in surmise;
    But if they would--they could"--around the board
    Thus Lara's vassals prattled of their lord.

                    X.

    It was the night--and Lara's glassy stream
    The stars are studding, each with imaged beam;
    So calm, the waters scarcely seem to stray,
    And yet they glide like Happiness away;[272]
    Reflecting far and fairy-like from high
    The immortal lights that live along the sky:                        160
    Its banks are fringed with many a goodly tree,
    And flowers the fairest that may feast the bee;
    Such in her chaplet infant Dian wove,
    And Innocence would offer to her love.
    These deck the shore; the waves their channel make
    In windings bright and mazy like the snake.
    All was so still, so soft in earth and air,
    You scarce would start to meet a spirit there;
    Secure that nought of evil could delight
    To walk in such a scene, on such a night!                           170
    It was a moment only for the good:
    So Lara deemed, nor longer there he stood,
    But turned in silence to his castle-gate;
    Such scene his soul no more could contemplate:
    Such scene reminded him of other days,
    Of skies more cloudless, moons of purer blaze,
    Of nights more soft and frequent, hearts that now--
    No--no--the storm may beat upon his brow,
    Unfelt, unsparing--but a night like this,
    A night of Beauty, mocked such breast as his.                       180

                     XI.

    He turned within his solitary hall,
    And his high shadow shot along the wall:
    There were the painted forms of other times,[273]
    'Twas all they left of virtues or of crimes,
    Save vague tradition; and the gloomy vaults
    That hid their dust, their foibles, and their faults;
    And half a column of the pompous page,
    That speeds the specious tale from age to age;
    Where History's pen its praise or blame supplies,
    And lies like Truth, and still most truly lies.                     190
    He wandering mused, and as the moonbeam shone
    Through the dim lattice, o'er the floor of stone,
    And the high fretted roof, and saints, that there
    O'er Gothic windows knelt in pictured prayer,[jk]
    Reflected in fantastic figures grew,
    Like life, but not like mortal life, to view;
    His bristling locks of sable, brow of gloom,
    And the wide waving of his shaken plume,
    Glanced like a spectre's attributes--and gave
    His aspect all that terror gives the grave.[jl]                     200

                    XII.

    'Twas midnight--all was slumber; the lone light
    Dimmed in the lamp, as both to break the night.
    Hark! there be murmurs heard in Lara's hall--
    A sound--a voice--a shriek--a fearful call!
    A long, loud shriek--and silence--did they hear
    That frantic echo burst the sleeping ear?
    They heard and rose, and, tremulously brave,
    Rush where the sound invoked their aid to save;
    They come with half-lit tapers in their hands,
    And snatched in startled haste unbelted brands.                     210

                    XIII.

    Cold as the marble where his length was laid,
    Pale as the beam that o'er his features played,
    Was Lara stretched; his half-drawn sabre near,
    Dropped it should seem in more than Nature's fear;
    Yet he was firm, or had been firm till now,
    And still Defiance knit his gathered brow;
    Though mixed with terror, senseless as he lay,
    There lived upon his lip the wish to slay;
    Some half formed threat in utterance there had died,
    Some imprecation of despairing Pride;                               220
    His eye was almost sealed, but not forsook,
    Even in its trance, the gladiator's look,
    That oft awake his aspect could disclose,
    And now was fixed in horrible repose.
    They raise him--bear him;--hush! he breathes, he speaks,
    The swarthy blush recolours in his cheeks,
    His lip resumes its red, his eye, though dim,
    Rolls wide and wild, each slowly quivering limb
    Recalls its function, but his words are strung
    In terms that seem not of his native tongue;                        230
    Distinct but strange, enough they understand
    To deem them accents of another land;
    And such they were, and meant to meet an ear
    That hears him not--alas! that cannot hear!

                    XIV.

    His page approached, and he alone appeared
    To know the import of the words they heard;
    And, by the changes of his cheek and brow,
    They were not such as Lara should avow,
    Nor he interpret,--yet with less surprise
    Than those around their Chieftain's state he eyes,                  240
    But Lara's prostrate form he bent beside,
    And in that tongue which seemed his own replied;
    And Lara heeds those tones that gently seem
    To soothe away the horrors of his dream--
    If dream it were, that thus could overthrow
    A breast that needed not ideal woe.

                    XV.

    Whate'er his frenzy dreamed or eye beheld,--
    If yet remembered ne'er to be revealed,--
    Rests at his heart: the customed morning came,
    And breathed new vigour in his shaken frame;                        250
    And solace sought he none from priest nor leech,
    And soon the same in movement and in speech,
    As heretofore he filled the passing hours,
    Nor less he smiles, nor more his forehead lowers,
    Than these were wont; and if the coming night
    Appeared less welcome now to Lara's sight,
    He to his marvelling vassals showed it not,
    Whose shuddering proved _their_ fear was less forgot.
    In trembling pairs (alone they dared not) crawl[jm]
    The astonished slaves, and shun the fated hall;                     260
    The waving banner, and the clapping door,
    The rustling tapestry, and the echoing floor;
    The long dim shadows of surrounding trees,
    The flapping bat, the night song of the breeze;
    Aught they behold or hear their thought appals,
    As evening saddens o'er the dark grey walls.

                    XVI.

    Vain thought! that hour of ne'er unravelled gloom
    Came not again, or Lara could assume
    A seeming of forgetfulness, that made
    His vassals more amazed nor less afraid.                            270
    Had Memory vanished then with sense restored?
    Since word, nor look, nor gesture of their lord
    Betrayed a feeling that recalled to these
    That fevered moment of his mind's disease.
    Was it a dream? was his the voice that spoke
    Those strange wild accents; his the cry that broke
    Their slumber? his the oppressed, o'erlaboured heart
    That ceased to beat, the look that made them start?
    Could he who thus had suffered so forget,
    When such as saw that suffering shudder yet?                        280
    Or did that silence prove his memory fixed
    Too deep for words, indelible, unmixed
    In that corroding secrecy which gnaws
    The heart to show the effect, but not the cause?
    Not so in him; his breast had buried both,
    Nor common gazers could discern the growth
    Of thoughts that mortal lips must leave half told;
    They choke the feeble words that would unfold.

                    XVII.

    In him inexplicably mixed appeared
    Much to be loved and hated, sought and feared;                      290
    Opinion varying o'er his hidden lot,[jn]
    In praise or railing ne'er his name forgot:
    His silence formed a theme for others' prate--
    They guessed--they gazed--they fain would know his fate.
    What had he been? what was he, thus unknown,
    Who walked their world, his lineage only known?
    A hater of his kind? yet some would say,
    With them he could seem gay amidst the gay;[jo]
    But owned that smile, if oft observed and near,
    Waned in its mirth, and withered to a sneer;                        300
    That smile might reach his lip, but passed not by,
    Nor e'er could trace its laughter to his eye:
    Yet there was softness too in his regard,
    At times, a heart as not by nature hard,
    But once perceived, his Spirit seemed to chide
    Such weakness, as unworthy of its pride,
    And steeled itself, as scorning to redeem
    One doubt from others' half withheld esteem;
    In self-inflicted penance of a breast
    Which Tenderness might once have wrung from Rest;                   310
    In vigilance of Grief that would compel
    The soul to hate for having loved too well.[274]

                    XVIII.

    There was in him a vital scorn of all:[jp]
    As if the worst had fallen which could befall,
    He stood a stranger in this breathing world,
    An erring Spirit from another hurled;
    A thing of dark imaginings, that shaped
    By choice the perils he by chance escaped;
    But 'scaped in vain, for in their memory yet
    His mind would half exult and half regret:                          320
    With more capacity for love than Earth
    Bestows on most of mortal mould and birth.
    His early dreams of good outstripped the truth,[275]
    And troubled Manhood followed baffled Youth;
    With thought of years in phantom chase misspent,
    And wasted powers for better purpose lent;
    And fiery passions that had poured their wrath
    In hurried desolation o'er his path,
    And left the better feelings all at strife[jq]
    In wild reflection o'er his stormy life;                            330
    But haughty still, and loth himself to blame,
    He called on Nature's self to share the shame,
    And charged all faults upon the fleshly form
    She gave to clog the soul, and feast the worm:
    Till he at last confounded good and ill,
    And half mistook for fate the acts of will:[jr][276]
    Too high for common selfishness, he could
    At times resign his own for others' good,
    But not in pity--not because he ought,
    But in some strange perversity of thought,                          340
    That swayed him onward with a secret pride
    To do what few or none would do beside;
    And this same impulse would, in tempting time,
    Mislead his spirit equally to crime;
    So much he soared beyond, or sunk beneath,
    The men with whom he felt condemned to breathe,
    And longed by good or ill to separate
    Himself from all who shared his mortal state;
    His mind abhorring this had fixed her throne
    Far from the world, in regions of her own:                          350
    Thus coldly passing all that passed below,
    His blood in temperate seeming now would flow:
    Ah! happier if it ne'er with guilt had glowed,
    But ever in that icy smoothness flowed!
    'Tis true, with other men their path he walked,
    And like the rest in seeming did and talked,
    Nor outraged Reason's rules by flaw nor start,
    His Madness was not of the head, but heart;
    And rarely wandered in his speech, or drew
    His thoughts so forth as to offend the view.                        360

                    XIX.

    With all that chilling mystery of mien,
    And seeming gladness to remain unseen,
    He had (if 'twere not nature's boon) an art
    Of fixing memory on another's heart:
    It was not love perchance--nor hate--nor aught
    That words can image to express the thought;
    But they who saw him did not see in vain,
    And once beheld--would ask of him again:
    And those to whom he spake remembered well,
    And on the words, however light, would dwell:                       370
    None knew, nor how, nor why, but he entwined
    Himself perforce around the hearer's mind;[js]
    There he was stamped, in liking, or in hate,
    If greeted once; however brief the date
    That friendship, pity, or aversion knew,[jt]
    Still there within the inmost thought he grew.
    You could not penetrate his soul, but found,
    Despite your wonder, to your own he wound;
    His presence haunted still; and from the breast[ju]
    He forced an all unwilling interest:                                380
    Vain was the struggle in that mental net--
    His Spirit seemed to dare you to forget!

                    XX.

    There is a festival, where knights and dames,
    And aught that wealth or lofty lineage claims,
    Appear--a high-born and a welcome guest
    To Otho's hall came Lara with the rest.
    The long carousal shakes the illumined hall,
    Well speeds alike the banquet and the ball;
    And the gay dance of bounding Beauty's train
    Links grace and harmony in happiest chain:                          390
    Blest are the early hearts and gentle hands
    That mingle there in well according bands;
    It is a sight the careful brow might smooth,
    And make Age smile, and dream itself to youth,
    And Youth forget such hour was past on earth,
    So springs the exulting bosom to that mirth![jv]

                    XXI.

    And Lara gazed on these, sedately glad,
    His brow belied him if his soul was sad;
    And his glance followed fast each fluttering fair,
    Whose steps of lightness woke no echo there:                        400
    He leaned against the lofty pillar nigh,
    With folded arms and long attentive eye,
    Nor marked a glance so sternly fixed on his--
    Ill brooked high Lara scrutiny like this:
    At length he caught it--'tis a face unknown,
    But seems as searching his, and his alone;
    Prying and dark, a stranger's by his mien,
    Who still till now had gazed on him unseen:
    At length encountering meets the mutual gaze
    Of keen enquiry, and of mute amaze;                                 410
    On Lara's glance emotion gathering grew,
    As if distrusting that the stranger threw;
    Along the stranger's aspect, fixed and stern,
    Flashed more than thence the vulgar eye could learn.

                    XXII.

    "'Tis he!" the stranger cried, and those that heard
    Re-echoed fast and far the whispered word.
    "'Tis he!"--"'Tis who?" they question far and near,
    Till louder accents rung on Lara's ear;
    So widely spread, few bosoms well could brook
    The general marvel, or that single look:                            420
    But Lara stirred not, changed not, the surprise
    That sprung at first to his arrested eyes
    Seemed now subsided--neither sunk nor raised
    Glanced his eye round, though still the stranger gazed;
    And drawing nigh, exclaimed, with haughty sneer,
    "'Tis he!--how came he thence?--what doth he here?"

                    XXIII.

    It were too much for Lara to pass by
    Such questions, so repeated fierce and high;[jw]
    With look collected, but with accent cold,
    More mildly firm than petulantly bold,                              430
    He turned, and met the inquisitorial tone--
    "My name is Lara--when thine own is known,
    Doubt not my fitting answer to requite
    The unlooked for courtesy of such a knight.
    'Tis Lara!--further wouldst thou mark or ask?
    I shun no question, and I wear no mask."

      "Thou _shunn'st_ no question! Ponder--is there none
    Thy heart must answer, though thine ear would shun?
    And deem'st thou me unknown too? Gaze again!
    At least thy memory was not given in vain.                          440
    Oh! never canst thou cancel half her debt--
    Eternity forbids thee to forget."
    With slow and searching glance upon his face
    Grew Lara's eyes, but nothing there could trace
    They knew, or chose to know--with dubious look
    He deigned no answer, but his head he shook,
    And half contemptuous turned to pass away;
    But the stern stranger motioned him to stay.

      "A word!--I charge thee stay, and answer here
    To one, who, wert thou noble, were thy peer,                        450
    But as thou wast and art--nay, frown not, Lord,
    If false, 'tis easy to disprove the word--
    But as thou wast and art, on thee looks down,
    Distrusts thy smiles, but shakes not at thy frown.
    Art thou not he? whose deeds----"[jx]
                                   "Whate'er I be,
    Words wild as these, accusers like to thee,
    I list no further; those with whom they weigh
    May hear the rest, nor venture to gainsay
    The wondrous tale no doubt thy tongue can tell,
    Which thus begins so courteously and well.                          460
    Let Otho cherish here his polished guest,
    To him my thanks and thoughts shall be expressed."
    And here their wondering host hath interposed--
      "Whate'er there be between you undisclosed,
    This is no time nor fitting place to mar
    The mirthful meeting with a wordy war.
    If thou, Sir Ezzelin, hast aught to show
    Which it befits Count Lara's ear to know,
    To-morrow, here, or elsewhere, as may best
    Beseem your mutual judgment, speak the rest;                        470
    I pledge myself for thee, as not unknown,
    Though, like Count Lara, now returned alone
    From other lands, almost a stranger grown;
    And if from Lara's blood and gentle birth
    I augur right of courage and of worth,
    He will not that untainted line belie,
    Nor aught that Knighthood may accord, deny."

      "To-morrow be it," Ezzelin replied,
    "And here our several worth and truth be tried;
    I gage my life, my falchion to attest                               480
    My words, so may I mingle with the blest!"
    What answers Lara? to its centre shrunk
    His soul, in deep abstraction sudden sunk;
    The words of many, and the eyes of all
    That there were gathered, seemed on him to fall;
    But his were silent, his appeared to stray
    In far forgetfulness away--away--
    Alas! that heedlessness of all around
    Bespoke remembrance only too profound.

                    XXIV.

    "To-morrow!--aye, to-morrow!" further word[jy]                      490
    Than those repeated none from Lara heard;
    Upon his brow no outward passion spoke;
    From his large eye no flashing anger broke;
    Yet there was something fixed in that low tone,
    Which showed resolve, determined, though unknown.
    He seized his cloak--his head he slightly bowed,
    And passing Ezzelin, he left the crowd;
    And, as he passed him, smiling met the frown
    With which that Chieftain's brow would bear him down:
    It was nor smile of mirth, nor struggling pride                     500
    That curbs to scorn the wrath it cannot hide;
    But that of one in his own heart secure
    Of all that he would do, or could endure.
    Could this mean peace? the calmness of the good?
    Or guilt grown old in desperate hardihood?
    Alas! too like in confidence are each,
    For man to trust to mortal look or speech;
    From deeds, and deeds alone, may he discern
    Truths which it wrings the unpractised heart to learn.

                    XXV.

    And Lara called his page, and went his way--                        510
    Well could that stripling word or sign obey:
    His only follower from those climes afar,
    Where the Soul glows beneath a brighter star:
    For Lara left the shore from whence he sprung,
    In duty patient, and sedate though young;
    Silent as him he served, his faith appears
    Above his station, and beyond his years.
    Though not unknown the tongue of Lara's land,
    In such from him he rarely heard command;
    But fleet his step, and clear his tones would come,                 520
    When Lara's lip breathed forth the words of home:
    Those accents, as his native mountains dear,
    Awake their absent echoes in his ear,[jz]
    Friends'--kindred's--parents'--wonted voice recall,
    Now lost, abjured, for one--his friend, his all:
    For him earth now disclosed no other guide;
    What marvel then he rarely left his side?

                    XXVI.

    Light was his form, and darkly delicate
    That brow whereon his native sun had sate,
    But had not marred, though in his beams he grew,                    530
    The cheek where oft the unbidden blush shone through;
    Yet not such blush as mounts when health would show
    All the heart's hue in that delighted glow;
    But 'twas a hectic tint of secret care
    That for a burning moment fevered there;
    And the wild sparkle of his eye seemed caught
    From high, and lightened with electric thought,[ka]
    Though its black orb those long low lashes' fringe
    Had tempered with a melancholy tinge;
    Yet less of sorrow than of pride was there,                         540
    Or, if 'twere grief, a grief that none should share:
    And pleased not him the sports that please his age,
    The tricks of Youth, the frolics of the Page;
    For hours on Lara he would fix his glance,
    As all-forgotten in that watchful trance;
    And from his chief withdrawn, he wandered lone,
    Brief were his answers, and his questions none;
    His walk the wood, his sport some foreign book;
    His resting-place the bank that curbs the brook:
    He seemed, like him he served, to live apart                        550
    From all that lures the eye, and fills the heart;
    To know no brotherhood, and take from earth
    No gift beyond that bitter boon--our birth.

                    XXVII.

    If aught he loved, 'twas Lara; but was shown
    His faith in reverence and in deeds alone;
    In mute attention; and his care, which guessed
    Each wish, fulfilled it ere the tongue expressed.
    Still there was haughtiness in all he did,
    A spirit deep that brooked not to be chid;
    His zeal, though more than that of servile hands,[kb]               560
    In act alone obeys, his air commands;
    As if 'twas Lara's less than _his_ desire
    That thus he served, but surely not for hire.
    Slight were the tasks enjoined him by his Lord,
    To hold the stirrup, or to bear the sword;
    To tune his lute, or, if he willed it more,[kc]
    On tomes of other times and tongues to pore;
    But ne'er to mingle with the menial train,
    To whom he showed nor deference nor disdain,
    But that well-worn reserve which proved he knew                     570
    No sympathy with that familiar crew:
    His soul, whate'er his station or his stem,
    Could bow to Lara, not descend to them.
    Of higher birth he seemed, and better days,
    Nor mark of vulgar toil that hand betrays,
    So femininely white it might bespeak
    Another sex, when matched with that smooth cheek,
    But for his garb, and something in his gaze,
    More wild and high than Woman's eye betrays;
    A latent fierceness that far more became                            580
    His fiery climate than his tender frame:
    True, in his words it broke not from his breast,
    But from his aspect might be more than guessed.[kd]
    Kaled his name, though rumour said he bore
    Another ere he left his mountain-shore;
    For sometimes he would hear, however nigh,
    That name repeated loud without reply,
    As unfamiliar--or, if roused again,
    Start to the sound, as but remembered then;
    Unless 'twas Lara's wonted voice that spake,                        590
    For then--ear--eyes--and heart would all awake.

                    XXVIII.

    He had looked down upon the festive hall,
    And mark'd that sudden strife so marked of all:
    And when the crowd around and near him told[ke]
    Their wonder at the calmness of the bold,
    Their marvel how the high-born Lara bore
    Such insult from a stranger, doubly sore,
    The colour of young Kaled went and came,
    The lip of ashes, and the cheek of flame;
    And o'er his brow the dampening heart-drops threw                   600
    The sickening iciness of that cold dew,
    That rises as the busy bosom sinks
    With heavy thoughts from which Reflection shrinks.
    Yes--there be things which we must dream and dare,
    And execute ere thought be half aware:[277]
    Whate'er might Kaled's be, it was enow
    To seal his lip, but agonise his brow.
    He gazed on Ezzelin till Lara cast
    That sidelong smile upon the knight he past;
    When Kaled saw that smile his visage fell,                          610
    As if on something recognised right well:
    His memory read in such a meaning more
    Than Lara's aspect unto others wore:
    Forward he sprung--a moment, both were gone,
    And all within that hall seemed left alone;
    Each had so fixed his eye on Lara's mien,
    All had so mixed their feelings with that scene,
    That when his long dark shadow through the porch
    No more relieves the glare of yon high torch,
    Each pulse beats quicker, and all bosoms seem                       620
    To bound as doubting from too black a dream,
    Such as we know is false, yet dread in sooth,
    Because the worst is ever nearest truth.
    And they are gone--but Ezzelin is there,
    With thoughtful visage and imperious air;
    But long remained not; ere an hour expired
    He waved his hand to Otho, and retired.

                    XXIX.

    The crowd are gone, the revellers at rest;
    The courteous host, and all-approving guest,
    Again to that accustomed couch must creep                           630
    Where Joy subsides, and Sorrow sighs to sleep,
    And Man, o'erlaboured with his Being's strife,
    Shrinks to that sweet forgetfulness of life:
    There lie Love's feverish hope, and Cunning's guile,[kf]
    Hate's working brain, and lulled Ambition's wile;
    O'er each vain eye Oblivion's pinions wave,
    And quenched Existence crouches in a grave.[kg]
    What better name may Slumber's bed become?
    Night's sepulchre, the universal home,
    Where Weakness--Strength--Vice--Virtue--sunk supine,                640
    Alike in naked helplessness recline;
    Glad for a while to heave unconscious breath,
    Yet wake to wrestle with the dread of Death,
    And shun--though Day but dawn on ills increased--
    That sleep,--the loveliest, since it dreams the least.



                     CANTO THE SECOND.

                    I.

    Night wanes--the vapours round the mountains curled[278]
    Melt into morn, and Light awakes the world,
    Man has another day to swell the past,
    And lead him near to little, but his last;
    But mighty Nature bounds as from her birth,                         650
    The Sun is in the heavens, and Life on earth;[279]
    Flowers in the valley, splendour in the beam,
    Health on the gale, and freshness in the stream.
    Immortal Man! behold her glories shine,
    And cry, exulting inly, "They are thine!"
    Gaze on, while yet thy gladdened eye may see:
    A morrow comes when they are not for thee:
    And grieve what may above thy senseless bier,
    Nor earth nor sky will yield a single tear;
    Nor cloud shall gather more, nor leaf shall fall,                   660
    Nor gale breathe forth one sigh for thee, for all;[280]
    But creeping things shall revel in their spoil,
    And fit thy clay to fertilise the soil.

                    II.

    'Tis morn--'tis noon--assembled in the hall,
    The gathered Chieftains come to Otho's call;
    'Tis now the promised hour, that must proclaim
    The life or death of Lara's future fame;
    And Ezzelin his charge may here unfold,[kh]
    And whatsoe'er the tale, it must be told.
    His faith was pledged, and Lara's promise given,                    670
    To meet it in the eye of Man and Heaven.
    Why comes he not? Such truths to be divulged,
    Methinks the accuser's rest is long indulged.

                    III.

    The hour is past, and Lara too is there,
    With self-confiding, coldly patient air;
    Why comes not Ezzelin? The hour is past,
    And murmurs rise, and Otho's brow's o'ercast.
    "I know my friend! his faith I cannot fear,
    If yet he be on earth, expect him here;
    The roof that held him in the valley stands                         680
    Between my own and noble Lara's lands;
    My halls from such a guest had honour gained,
    Nor had Sir Ezzelin his host disdained,
    But that some previous proof forbade his stay,
    And urged him to prepare against to-day;
    The word I pledged for his I pledge again,
    Or will myself redeem his knighthood's stain."
    He ceased--and Lara answered, "I am here
    To lend at thy demand a listening ear
    To tales of evil from a stranger's tongue,                          690
    Whose words already might my heart have wrung,
    But that I deemed him scarcely less than mad,
    Or, at the worst, a foe ignobly bad.
    I know him not--but me it seems he knew
    In lands where--but I must not trifle too:
    Produce this babbler--or redeem the pledge;
    Here in thy hold, and with thy falchion's edge."[ki]

    Proud Otho on the instant, reddening, threw
    His glove on earth, and forth his sabre flew.
    "The last alternative befits me best,                               700
    And thus I answer for mine absent guest."

    With cheek unchanging from its sallow gloom,
    However near his own or other's tomb;
    With hand, whose almost careless coolness spoke
    Its grasp well-used to deal the sabre-stroke;
    With eye, though calm, determined not to spare,
    Did Lara too his willing weapon bare.
    In vain the circling Chieftains round them closed,
    For Otho's frenzy would not be opposed;
    And from his lip those words of insult fell--                       710
    His sword is good who can maintain them well.

                    IV.

    Short was the conflict; furious, blindly rash,
    Vain Otho gave his bosom to the gash:
    He bled, and fell; but not with deadly wound,
    Stretched by a dextrous sleight along the ground.
    "Demand thy life!" He answered not: and then
    From that red floor he ne'er had risen again,
    For Lara's brow upon the moment grew
    Almost to blackness in its demon hue;[281]
    And fiercer shook his angry falchion now                            720
    Than when his foe's was levelled at his brow;
    Then all was stern collectedness and art,
    Now rose the unleavened hatred of his heart;
    So little sparing to the foe he felled,[kj]
    That when the approaching crowd his arm withheld,
    He almost turned the thirsty point on those
    Who thus for mercy dared to interpose;
    But to a moment's thought that purpose bent;
    Yet looked he on him still with eye intent,
    As if he loathed the ineffectual strife                             730
    That left a foe, howe'er o'erthrown, with life;
    As if to search how far the wound he gave
    Had sent its victim onward to his grave.

                    V.

    They raised the bleeding Otho, and the Leech
    Forbade all present question, sign, and speech;
    The others met within a neighbouring hall,
    And he, incensed, and heedless of them all,[kk]
    The cause and conqueror in this sudden fray,
    In haughty silence slowly strode away;
    He backed his steed, his homeward path he took,                     740
    Nor cast on Otho's towers a single look.

                    VI.

    But where was he? that meteor of a night,
    Who menaced but to disappear with light.
    Where was this Ezzelin? who came and went,
    To leave no other trace of his intent.
    He left the dome of Otho long ere morn,
    In darkness, yet so well the path was worn
    He could not miss it: near his dwelling lay;
    But there he was not, and with coming day
    Came fast inquiry, which unfolded nought,                           750
    Except the absence of the Chief it sought.
    A chamber tenantless, a steed at rest,
    His host alarmed, his murmuring squires distressed:
    Their search extends along, around the path,
    In dread to meet the marks of prowlers' wrath:
    But none are there, and not a brake hath borne
    Nor gout of blood, nor shred of mantle torn;
    Nor fall nor struggle hath defaced the grass,
    Which still retains a mark where Murder was;
    Nor dabbling fingers left to tell the tale,                         760
    The bitter print of each convulsive nail,
    When agonised hands that cease to guard,
    Wound in that pang the smoothness of the sward.
    Some such had been, if here a life was reft,
    But these were not; and doubting Hope is left;
    And strange Suspicion, whispering Lara's name,
    Now daily mutters o'er his blackened fame;
    Then sudden silent when his form appeared,
    Awaits the absence of the thing it feared
    Again its wonted wondering to renew,                                770
    And dye conjecture with a darker hue.

                    VII.

    Days roll along, and Otho's wounds are healed,
    But not his pride; and hate no more concealed:
    He was a man of power, and Lara's foe,
    The friend of all who sought to work him woe,
    And from his country's justice now demands
    Account of Ezzelin at Lara's hands.
    Who else than Lara could have cause to fear
    His presence? who had made him disappear,
    If not the man on whom his menaced charge                           780
    Had sate too deeply were he left at large?
    The general rumour ignorantly loud,
    The mystery dearest to the curious crowd;
    The seeming friendliness of him who strove
    To win no confidence, and wake no love;
    The sweeping fierceness which his soul betrayed,
    The skill with which he wielded his keen blade;
    Where had his arm unwarlike caught that art?
    Where had that fierceness grown upon his heart?
    For it was not the blind capricious rage[kl]                        790
    A word can kindle and a word assuage;
    But the deep working of a soul unmixed
    With aught of pity where its wrath had fixed;
    Such as long power and overgorged success
    Concentrates into all that's merciless:
    These, linked with that desire which ever sways
    Mankind, the rather to condemn than praise,
    'Gainst Lara gathering raised at length a storm,
    Such as himself might fear, and foes would form,
    And he must answer for the absent head                              800
    Of one that haunts him still, alive or dead.

                    VIII.

    Within that land was many a malcontent,
    Who cursed the tyranny to which he bent;
    That soil full many a wringing despot saw,
    Who worked his wantonness in form of law;
    Long war without and frequent broil within
    Had made a path for blood and giant sin,
    That waited but a signal to begin
    New havoc, such as civil discord blends,
    Which knows no neuter, owns but foes or friends;                    810
    Fixed in his feudal fortress each was lord,
    In word and deed obeyed, in soul abhorred.
    Thus Lara had inherited his lands,
    And with them pining hearts and sluggish hands;
    But that long absence from his native clime
    Had left him stainless of Oppression's crime,
    And now, diverted by his milder sway,[km]
    All dread by slow degrees had worn away.
    The menials felt their usual awe alone,
    But more for him than them that fear was grown;                     820
    They deemed him now unhappy, though at first
    Their evil judgment augured of the worst,
    And each long restless night, and silent mood,
    Was traced to sickness, fed by solitude:
    And though his lonely habits threw of late
    Gloom o'er his chamber, cheerful was his gate;[kn]
    For thence the wretched ne'er unsoothed withdrew,
    For them, at least, his soul compassion knew.
    Cold to the great, contemptuous to the high,
    The humble passed not his unheeding eye;                            830
    Much he would speak not, but beneath his roof
    They found asylum oft, and ne'er reproof.
    And they who watched might mark that, day by day,
    Some new retainers gathered to his sway;
    But most of late, since Ezzelin was lost,
    He played the courteous lord and bounteous host:
    Perchance his strife with Otho made him dread
    Some snare prepared for his obnoxious head;
    Whate'er his view, his favour more obtains
    With these, the people, than his fellow thanes.                     840
    If this were policy, so far 'twas sound,
    The million judged but of him as they found;
    From him by sterner chiefs to exile driven
    They but required a shelter, and 'twas given.
    By him no peasant mourned his rifled cot,
    And scarce the Serf could murmur o'er his lot;
    With him old Avarice found its hoard secure,
    With him contempt forbore to mock the poor;
    Youth present cheer and promised recompense
    Detained, till all too late to part from thence:                    850
    To Hate he offered, with the coming change,
    The deep reversion of delayed revenge;
    To Love, long baffled by the unequal match,
    The well-won charms success was sure to snatch.[ko]
    All now was ripe, he waits but to proclaim
    That slavery nothing which was still a name.
    The moment came, the hour when Otho thought
    Secure at last the vengeance which he sought:
    His summons found the destined criminal
    Begirt by thousands in his swarming hall;                           860
    Fresh from their feudal fetters newly riven,
    Defying earth, and confident of heaven.
    That morning he had freed the soil-bound slaves,
    Who dig no land for tyrants but their graves!
    Such is their cry--some watchword for the fight
    Must vindicate the wrong, and warp the right;
    Religion--Freedom--Vengeance--what you will,
    A word's enough to raise Mankind to kill;[kp]
    Some factious phrase by cunning caught and spread,
    That Guilt may reign-and wolves and worms be fed!                   870

                    IX.

    Throughout that clime the feudal Chiefs had gained
    Such sway, their infant monarch hardly reigned;
    Now was the hour for Faction's rebel growth,
    The Serfs contemned the one, and hated both:
    They waited but a leader, and they found
    One to their cause inseparably bound;
    By circumstance compelled to plunge again,
    In self-defence, amidst the strife of men.
    Cut off by some mysterious fate from those
    Whom Birth and Nature meant not for his foes,                       880
    Had Lara from that night, to him accurst,
    Prepared to meet, but not alone, the worst:
    Some reason urged, whate'er it was, to shun
    Inquiry into deeds at distance done;
    By mingling with his own the cause of all,
    E'en if he failed, he still delayed his fall.
    The sullen calm that long his bosom kept,
    The storm that once had spent itself and slept,
    Roused by events that seemed foredoomed to urge
    His gloomy fortunes to their utmost verge,                          890
    Burst forth, and made him all he once had been,
    And is again; he only changed the scene.
    Light care had he for life, and less for fame,
    But not less fitted for the desperate game:
    He deemed himself marked out for others' hate,
    And mocked at Ruin so they shared his fate.
    And cared he for the freedom of the crowd?
    He raised the humble but to bend the proud.
    He had hoped quiet in his sullen lair,
    But Man and Destiny beset him there:                                900
    Inured to hunters, he was found at bay;
    And they must kill, they cannot snare the prey.
    Stern, unambitious, silent, he had been
    Henceforth a calm spectator of Life's scene;
    But dragged again upon the arena, stood
    A leader not unequal to the feud;
    In voice--mien--gesture--savage nature spoke,
    And from his eye the gladiator broke.

                    X.

    What boots the oft-repeated tale of strife,
    The feast of vultures, and the waste of life?                       910
    The varying fortune of each separate field,
    The fierce that vanquish, and the faint that yield?
    The smoking ruin, and the crumbled wall?
    In this the struggle was the same with all;
    Save that distempered passions lent their force
    In bitterness that banished all remorse.
    None sued, for Mercy knew her cry was vain,
    The captive died upon the battle-plain:[kq]
    In either cause, one rage alone possessed
    The empire of the alternate victor's breast;                        920
    And they that smote for freedom or for sway,
    Deemed few were slain, while more remained to slay.
    It was too late to check the wasting brand,
    And Desolation reaped the famished land;
    The torch was lighted, and the flame was spread,
    And Carnage smiled upon her daily dead.

                    XI.

    Fresh with the nerve the new-born impulse strung,
    The first success to Lara's numbers clung:
    But that vain victory hath ruined all;
    They form no longer to their leader's call:                         930
    In blind confusion on the foe they press,
    And think to snatch is to secure success.
    The lust of booty, and the thirst of hate,
    Lure on the broken brigands to their fate:
    In vain he doth whate'er a chief may do,
    To check the headlong fury of that crew;
    In vain their stubborn ardour he would tame,
    The hand that kindles cannot quench the flame;
    The wary foe alone hath turned their mood,
    And shown their rashness to that erring brood:                      940
    The feigned retreat, the nightly ambuscade,
    The daily harass, and the fight delayed,
    The long privation of the hoped supply,
    The tentless rest beneath the humid sky,
    The stubborn wall that mocks the leaguer's art,
    And palls the patience of his baffled art,
    Of these they had not deemed: the battle-day
    They could encounter as a veteran may;
    But more preferred the fury of the strife,[kr]
    And present death, to hourly suffering life:                        950
    And Famine wrings, and Fever sweeps away
    His numbers melting fast from their array;
    Intemperate triumph fades to discontent,
    And Lara's soul alone seems still unbent;
    But few remain to aid his voice and hand,
    And thousands dwindled to a scanty band:
    Desperate, though few, the last and best remained
    To mourn the discipline they late disdained.
    One hope survives, the frontier is not far,
    And thence they may escape from native war:                         960
    And bear within them to the neighbouring state
    An exile's sorrows, or an outlaw's hate:
    Hard is the task their father-land to quit,
    But harder still to perish or submit.

                    XII.

    It is resolved--they march--consenting Night
    Guides with her star their dim and torchless flight;
    Already they perceive its tranquil beam
    Sleep on the surface of the barrier stream;
    Already they descry--Is yon the bank?
    Away! 'tis lined with many a hostile rank.                          970
    Return or fly!--What glitters in the rear?
    'Tis Otho's banner--the pursuer's spear!
    Are those the shepherds' fires upon the height?
    Alas! they blaze too widely for the flight:
    Cut off from hope, and compassed in the toil,
    Less blood perchance hath bought a richer spoil!

                    XIII.

    A moment's pause--'tis but to breathe their band,
    Or shall they onward press, or here withstand?
    It matters little--if they charge the foes
    Who by their border-stream their march oppose,                      980
    Some few, perchance, may break and pass the line,
    However linked to baffle such design.
    "The charge be ours! to wait for their assault
    Were fate well worthy of a coward's halt."
    Forth flies each sabre, reined is every steed,
    And the next word shall scarce outstrip the deed:
    In the next tone of Lara's gathering breath
    How many shall but hear the voice of Death!

                    XIV.

    His blade is bared,--in him there is an air
    As deep, but far too tranquil for despair;                          990
    A something of indifference more than then
    Becomes the bravest, if they feel for men--
    He turned his eye on Kaled, ever near,
    And still too faithful to betray one fear;
    Perchance 'twas but the moon's dim twilight threw
    Along his aspect an unwonted hue
    Of mournful paleness, whose deep tint expressed
    The truth, and not the terror of his breast.
    This Lara marked, and laid his hand on his:
    It trembled not in such an hour as this;                           1000
    His lip was silent, scarcely beat his heart,
    His eye alone proclaimed, "We will not part!
    Thy band may perish, or thy friends may flee,
    Farewell to Life--but not Adieu to thee!"

    The word hath passed his lips, and onward driven,
    Pours the linked band through ranks asunder riven:
    Well has each steed obeyed the armed heel,
    And flash the scimitars, and rings the steel;
    Outnumbered, not outbraved, they still oppose
    Despair to daring, and a front to foes;                            1010
    And blood is mingled with the dashing stream,
    Which runs all redly till the morning beam.[ks]

                    XV.[282]

    Commanding--aiding--animating all,[283]
    Where foe appeared to press, or friend to fall,
    Cheers Lara's voice, and waves or strikes his steel,
    Inspiring hope, himself had ceased to feel.
    None fled, for well they knew that flight were vain;
    But those that waver turn to smite again,
    While yet they find the firmest of the foe
    Recoil before their leader's look and blow:                        1020
    Now girt with numbers, now almost alone,
    He foils their ranks, or re-unites his own;
    Himself he spared not--once they seemed to fly--
    Now was the time, he waved his hand on high,
    And shook--Why sudden droops that plumed crest?
    The shaft is sped--the arrow's in his breast!
    That fatal gesture left the unguarded side,
    And Death has stricken down yon arm of pride.
    The word of triumph fainted from his tongue;
    That hand, so raised, how droopingly it hung!                      1030
    But yet the sword instinctively retains,
    Though from its fellow shrink the falling reins;
    These Kaled snatches: dizzy with the blow,
    And senseless bending o'er his saddle-bow,
    Perceives not Lara that his anxious page
    Beguiles his charger from the combat's rage:
    Meantime his followers charge, and charge again;
    Too mixed the slayers now to heed the slain!

                    XVI.

    Day glimmers on the dying and the dead,
    The cloven cuirass, and the helmless head;                         1040
    The war-horse masterless is on the earth,[kt][284]
    And that last gasp hath burst his bloody girth;
    And near, yet quivering with what life remained,
    The heel that urged him and the hand that reined;
    And some too near that rolling torrent lie,[ku]
    Whose waters mock the lip of those that die;
    That panting thirst which scorches in the breath
    Of those that die the soldier's fiery death,
    In vain impels the burning mouth to crave
    One drop--the last--to cool it for the grave;                      1050
    With feeble and convulsive effort swept,
    Their limbs along the crimsoned turf have crept;
    The faint remains of life such struggles waste,
    But yet they reach the stream, and bend to taste:
    They feel its freshness, and almost partake--
    Why pause? No further thirst have they to slake--
    It is unquenched, and yet they feel it not;
    It was an agony--but now forgot!

                    XVII.

    Beneath a lime, remoter from the scene,
    Where but for him that strife had never been,                      1060
    A breathing but devoted warrior lay:
    'Twas Lara bleeding fast from life away.
    His follower once, and now his only guide,
    Kneels Kaled watchful o'er his welling side,
    And with his scarf would staunch the tides that rush,
    With each convulsion, in a blacker gush;
    And then, as his faint breathing waxes low,
    In feebler, not less fatal tricklings flow:
    He scarce can speak, but motions him 'tis vain,
    And merely adds another throb to pain.                             1070
    He clasps the hand that pang which would assuage,
    And sadly smiles his thanks to that dark page,
    Who nothing fears--nor feels--nor heeds--nor sees--
    Save that damp brow which rests upon his knees;
    Save that pale aspect, where the eye, though dim,
    Held all the light that shone on earth for him.

                    XVIII.

    The foe arrives, who long had searched the field,
    Their triumph nought till Lara too should yield:
    They would remove him, but they see 'twere vain,
    And he regards them with a calm disdain,                           1080
    That rose to reconcile him with his fate,
    And that escape to death from living hate:
    And Otho comes, and leaping from his steed,
    Looks on the bleeding foe that made him bleed,
    And questions of his state; he answers not,
    Scarce glances on him as on one forgot,
    And turns to Kaled:--each remaining word
    They understood not, if distinctly heard;
    His dying tones are in that other tongue,
    To which some strange remembrance wildly clung.                    1090
    They spake of other scenes, but what--is known
    To Kaled, whom their meaning reached alone;
    And he replied, though faintly, to their sound,
    While gazed the rest in dumb amazement round:
    They seemed even then--that twain--unto the last
    To half forget the present in the past;
    To share between themselves some separate fate,
    Whose darkness none beside should penetrate.

                    XIX.[285]

    Their words though faint were many--from the tone
    Their import those who heard could judge alone;                    1100
    From this, you might have deemed young Kaled's death
    More near than Lara's by his voice and breath,
    So sad--so deep--and hesitating broke
    The accents his scarce-moving pale lips spoke;[kv]
    But Lara's voice, though low, at first was clear
    And calm, till murmuring Death gasped hoarsely near;
    But from his visage little could we guess,
    So unrepentant--dark--and passionless,[kw]
    Save that when struggling nearer to his last,
    Upon that page his eye was kindly cast;                            1110
    And once, as Kaled's answering accents ceased,
    Rose Lara's hand, and pointed to the East:
    Whether (as then the breaking Sun from high
    Rolled back the clouds) the morrow caught his eye,
    Or that 'twas chance--or some remembered scene,
    That raised his arm to point where such had been,
    Scarce Kaled seemed to know, but turned away,
    As if his heart abhorred that coming day,
    And shrunk his glance before that morning light,
    To look on Lara's brow--where all grew night.                      1120
    Yet sense seemed left, though better were its loss;
    For when one near displayed the absolving Cross,
    And proffered to his touch the holy bead,
    Of which his parting soul might own the need,
    He looked upon it with an eye profane,
    And smiled--Heaven pardon! if 'twere with disdain:
    And Kaled, though he spoke not, nor withdrew
    From Lara's face his fixed despairing view,
    With brow repulsive, and with gesture swift,
    Flung back the hand which held the sacred gift,                    1130
    As if such but disturbed the expiring man,
    Nor seemed to know his life but _then_ began--
    That Life of Immortality, secure[kx]
    To none, save them whose faith in Christ is sure.

                    XX.

    But gasping heaved the breath that Lara drew,[ky]
    And dull the film along his dim eye grew;
    His limbs stretched fluttering, and his head drooped o'er
    The weak yet still untiring knee that bore;
    He pressed the hand he held upon his heart--
    It beats no more, but Kaled will not part                          1140
    With the cold grasp, but feels, and feels in vain,
    For that faint throb which answers not again.
    "It beats!"--Away, thou dreamer! he is gone--
    It once _was_ Lara which thou look'st upon.

                    XXI.

    He gazed, as if not yet had passed away[kz]
    The haughty spirit of that humbled clay;
    And those around have roused him from his trance,
    But cannot tear from thence his fixed glance;
    And when, in raising him from where he bore
    Within his arms the form that felt no more,                        1150
    He saw the head his breast would still sustain,
    Roll down like earth to earth upon the plain;
    He did not dash himself thereby, nor tear
    The glossy tendrils of his raven hair,
    But strove to stand and gaze, but reeled and fell,
    Scarce breathing more than that he loved so well.
    Than that _he_ loved! Oh! never yet beneath
    The breast of _man_ such trusty love may breathe!
    That trying moment hath at once revealed
    The secret long and yet but half concealed;                        1160
    In baring to revive that lifeless breast,
    Its grief seemed ended, but the sex confessed;
    And life returned, and Kaled felt no shame--
    What now to her was Womanhood or Fame?

                    XXII.

    And Lara sleeps not where his fathers sleep,
    But where he died his grave was dug as deep;
    Nor is his mortal slumber less profound,
    Though priest nor blessed nor marble decked the mound,
    And he was mourned by one whose quiet grief,
    Less loud, outlasts a people's for their Chief.                    1170
    Vain was all question asked her of the past,
    And vain e'en menace--silent to the last;
    She told nor whence, nor why she left behind
    Her all for one who seemed but little kind.
    Why did she love him? Curious fool!--be still--
    Is human love the growth of human will?
    To her he might be gentleness; the stern
    Have deeper thoughts than your dull eyes discern,
    And when they love, your smilers guess not how
    Beats the strong heart, though less the lips avow.                 1180
    They were not common links, that formed the chain
    That bound to Lara Kaled's heart and brain;
    But that wild tale she brooked not to unfold,
    And sealed is now each lip that could have told.

                    XXIII.

    They laid him in the earth, and on his breast,
    Besides the wound that sent his soul to rest,
    They found the scattered dints of many a scar,
    Which were not planted there in recent war;
    Where'er had passed his summer years of life,
    It seems they vanished in a land of strife;                        1190
    But all unknown his Glory or his Guilt,[la]
    These only told that somewhere blood was spilt,
    And Ezzelin, who might have spoke the past,
    Returned no more--that night appeared his last.

                    XXIV.

    Upon that night (a peasant's is the tale)
    A Serf that crossed the intervening vale,[286]
    When Cynthia's light almost gave way to morn,
    And nearly veiled in mist her waning horn;
    A Serf, that rose betimes to thread the wood,
    And hew the bough that bought his children's food,                 1200
    Passed by the river that divides the plain
    Of Otho's lands and Lara's broad domain:
    He heard a tramp--a horse and horseman broke
    From out the wood--before him was a cloak
    Wrapt round some burthen at his saddle-bow,
    Bent was his head, and hidden was his brow.
    Roused by the sudden sight at such a time,
    And some foreboding that it might be crime,
    Himself unheeded watched the stranger's course,
    Who reached the river, bounded from his horse,                     1210
    And lifting thence the burthen which he bore,
    Heaved up the bank, and dashed it from the shore,
    Then paused--and looked--and turned--and seemed to watch,
    And still another hurried glance would snatch,
    And follow with his step the stream that flowed,
    As if even yet too much its surface showed;
    At once he started--stooped--around him strown
    The winter floods had scattered heaps of stone:
    Of these the heaviest thence he gathered there,
    And slung them with a more than common care.                       1220
    Meantime the Serf had crept to where unseen
    Himself might safely mark what this might mean;
    He caught a glimpse, as of a floating breast,
    And something glittered starlike on the vest;
    But ere he well could mark the buoyant trunk,
    A massy fragment smote it, and it sunk:[lb]
    It rose again, but indistinct to view,
    And left the waters of a purple hue,
    Then deeply disappeared: the horseman gazed
    Till ebbed the latest eddy it had raised;                          1230
    Then turning, vaulted on his pawing steed,
    And instant spurred him into panting speed.
    His face was masked--the features of the dead,
    If dead it were, escaped the observer's dread;
    But if in sooth a Star its bosom bore,
    Such is the badge that Knighthood ever wore,
    And such 'tis known Sir Ezzelin had worn
    Upon the night that led to such a morn.
    If thus he perished, Heaven receive his soul!
    His undiscovered limbs to ocean roll;                              1240
    And charity upon the hope would dwell
    It was not Lara's hand by which he fell.[lc]

                    XXV.

    And Kaled--Lara--Ezzelin, are gone,
    Alike without their monumental stone!
    The first, all efforts vainly strove to wean
    From lingering where her Chieftain's blood had been:
    Grief had so tamed a spirit once too proud,
    Her tears were few, her wailing never loud;
    But furious would you tear her from the spot
    Where yet she scarce believed that he was not,                     1250
    Her eye shot forth with all the living fire
    That haunts the tigress in her whelpless ire;
    But left to waste her weary moments there,
    She talked all idly unto shapes of air,
    Such as the busy brain of Sorrow paints,
    And woos to listen to her fond complaints:
    And she would sit beneath the very tree
    Where lay his drooping head upon her knee;
    And in that posture where she saw him fall,
    His words, his looks, his dying grasp recall;                      1260
    And she had shorn, but saved her raven hair,
    And oft would snatch it from her bosom there,
    And fold, and press it gently to the ground,
    As if she staunched anew some phantom's wound.[ld]
    Herself would question, and for him reply;
    Then rising, start, and beckon him to fly
    From some imagined Spectre in pursuit;
    Then seat her down upon some linden's root,
    And hide her visage with her meagre hand,
    Or trace strange characters along the sand--                       1270
    This could not last--she lies by him she loved;
    Her tale untold--her truth too dearly proved.

                             HEBREW MELODIES



                 SHE WALKS IN BEAUTY.[287]

                    I.

    She walks in Beauty, like the night
      Of cloudless climes and starry skies;
    And all that's best of dark and bright
      Meet in her aspect and her eyes:
    Thus mellowed to that tender light
      Which Heaven to gaudy day denies.

                    II.

    One shade the more, one ray the less,
      Had half impaired the nameless grace
    Which waves in every raven tress,
      Or softly lightens o'er her face;
    Where thoughts serenely sweet express,
     How pure, how dear their dwelling-place.

                    III.

    And on that cheek, and o'er that brow,
      So soft, so calm, yet eloquent,
    The smiles that win, the tints that glow,
      But tell of days in goodness spent,
    A mind at peace with all below,
      A heart whose love is innocent!

                                                          _June_ 12, 1814.



            THE HARP THE MONARCH MINSTREL SWEPT.

                    I.

      The Harp the Monarch Minstrel swept,[le]
        The King of men, the loved of Heaven!
      Which Music hallowed while she wept
        O'er tones her heart of hearts had given--
    Redoubled be her tears, its chords are riven!
      It softened men of iron mould,
        It gave them virtues not their own;
      No ear so dull, no soul so cold,
        That felt not--fired not to the tone,
    Till David's Lyre grew mightier than his Throne!

                    II.

      It told the triumphs of our King,[lf]
        It wafted glory to our God;
      It made our gladdened valleys ring,
        The cedars bow, the mountains nod;
    Its sound aspired to Heaven and there abode![288]
      Since then, though heard on earth no more,[lg]
        Devotion and her daughter Love
      Still bid the bursting spirit soar
        To sounds that seem as from above,
    In dreams that day's broad light can not remove.



                    IF THAT HIGH WORLD.

                    I.

    If that high world,[289] which lies beyond
      Our own, surviving Love endears;
    If there the cherished heart be fond,
      The eye the same, except in tears--
    How welcome those untrodden spheres!
      How sweet this very hour to die!
    To soar from earth and find all fears
      Lost in thy light--Eternity!

                    II.

    It must be so: 'tis not for self
      That we so tremble on the brink;
    And striving to o'erleap the gulf,
      Yet cling to Being's severing link.[lh]
    Oh! in that future let us think
      To hold each heart the heart that shares,
    With them the immortal waters drink,
      And soul in soul grow deathless theirs!



                     THE WILD GAZELLE.

                    I.

    The wild gazelle on Judah's hills
      Exulting yet may bound,
    And drink from all the living rills
      That gush on holy ground;
    Its airy step and glorious eye[290]
    May glance in tameless transport by:--

                    II.

    A step as fleet, an eye more bright,
      Hath Judah witnessed there;
    And o'er her scenes of lost delight
      Inhabitants more fair.
    The cedars wave on Lebanon,
    But Judah's statelier maids are gone!

                    III.

      Than Israel's scattered race;
    For, taking root, it there remains
      In solitary grace:
    It cannot quit its place of birth,
    It will not live in other earth.

                    IV.

    But we must wander witheringly,
      In other lands to die;
    And where our fathers' ashes be,
      Our own may never lie:
    Our temple hath not left a stone,
    And Mockery sits on Salem's throne.



                    OH! WEEP FOR THOSE.

                    I.

    Oh! weep for those that wept by Babel's stream,
    Whose shrines are desolate, whose land a dream;
    Weep for the harp of Judah's broken shell;
    Mourn--where their God hath dwelt the godless dwell!

                    II.

    And where shall Israel lave her bleeding feet?
    And when shall Zion's songs again seem sweet?
    And Judah's melody once more rejoice
    The hearts that leaped before its heavenly voice?

                    III.

    Tribes of the wandering foot and weary breast,
    How shall ye flee away and be at rest!
    The wild-dove hath her nest, the fox his cave,
    Mankind their country--Israel but the grave!



                     ON JORDAN'S BANKS.

                    I.

    On Jordan's banks the Arab's camels stray,
    On Sion's hill the False One's votaries pray,
    The Baal-adorer bows on Sinai's steep--
    Yet there--even there--Oh God! thy thunders sleep:

                    II.

    There--where thy finger scorched the tablet stone!
    There--where thy shadow to thy people shone!
    Thy glory shrouded in its garb of fire:
    Thyself--none living see and not expire!

                    III.

    Oh! in the lightning let thy glance appear;
    Sweep from his shivered hand the oppressor's spear!
    How long by tyrants shall thy land be trod?
    How long thy temple worshipless, Oh God?



                  JEPHTHA'S DAUGHTER.[291]

                    I.

    Since our Country, our God--Oh, my Sire!
    Demand that thy Daughter expire;
    Since thy triumph was bought by thy vow--
    Strike the bosom that's bared for thee now!

                    II.

    And the voice of my mourning is o'er,
    And the mountains behold me no more:
    If the hand that I love lay me low,
    There cannot be pain in the blow!

                    III.

    And of this, oh, my Father! be sure--
    That the blood of thy child is as pure
    As the blessing I beg ere it flow,
    And the last thought that soothes me below.

                    IV.

    Though the virgins of Salem lament,
    Be the judge and the hero unbent!
    I have won the great battle for thee,
    And my Father and Country are free!

                    V.

    When this blood of thy giving hath gushed,
    When the voice that thou lovest is hushed,
    Let my memory still be thy pride,
    And forget not I smiled as I died!



         OH! SNATCHED AWAY IN BEAUTY'S BLOOM.[292]

                    I.

      Oh! snatched away in beauty's bloom,
      On thee shall press no ponderous tomb;
        But on thy turf shall roses rear
        Their leaves, the earliest of the year;
    And the wild cypress wave in tender gloom:[li]

                    II.

      And oft by yon blue gushing stream
        Shall Sorrow lean her drooping head,[lj]
      And feed deep thought with many a dream,
        And lingering pause and lightly tread;
    Fond wretch! as if her step disturbed the dead!

                    III.

    Away! we know that tears are vain,
      That Death nor heeds nor hears distress:
    Will this unteach us to complain?
      Or make one mourner weep the less?
    And thou--who tell'st me to forget,[lk]
    Thy looks are wan, thine eyes are wet.[ll][293]

                            [Published in the _Examiner_, April 23, 1815.]



                      MY SOUL IS DARK.

                    I.

    My soul is dark--Oh! quickly string[294]
      The harp I yet can brook to hear;
    And let thy gentle fingers fling
      Its melting murmurs o'er mine ear.
    If in this heart a hope be dear,
      That sound shall charm it forth again:
    If in these eyes there lurk a tear,
      'Twill flow, and cease to burn my brain.

                    II.

    But bid the strain be wild and deep,
      Nor let thy notes of joy be first:
    I tell thee, minstrel, I must weep,
      Or else this heavy heart will burst;
    For it hath been by sorrow nursed,
      And ached in sleepless silence long;
    And now 'tis doomed to know the worst,
      And break at once--or yield to song.[295]



                      I SAW THEE WEEP.

                    I.

    I saw thee weep--the big bright tear
      Came o'er that eye of blue;[296]
    And then methought it did appear
      A violet dropping dew:
    I saw thee smile--the sapphire's blaze
      Beside thee ceased to shine;
    It could not match the living rays
      That filled that glance of thine.

                    II.

    As clouds from yonder sun receive
      A deep and mellow dye,
    Which scarce the shade of coming eve
      Can banish from the sky,
    Those smiles unto the moodiest mind
      Their own pure joy impart;
    Their sunshine leaves a glow behind
      That lightens o'er the heart.



                     THY DAYS ARE DONE.

                    I.

    Thy days are done, thy fame begun;
      Thy country's strains record
    The triumphs of her chosen Son,
      The slaughters of his sword!
    The deeds he did, the fields he won,
      The freedom he restored!

                    II.

    Though thou art fall'n, while we are free
      Thou shall not taste of death!
    The generous blood that flowed from thee
      Disdained to sink beneath:
    Within our veins its currents be,
      Thy spirit on our breath!

                    III.

    Thy name, our charging hosts along,
      Shall be the battle-word!
    Thy fall, the theme of choral song
      From virgin voices poured!
    To weep would do thy glory wrong:
      Thou shalt not be deplored.



                           SAUL.

                    I.

        Thou whose spell can raise the dead,
          Bid the Prophet's form appear.
        "Samuel, raise thy buried head!
          King, behold the phantom Seer!"
    Earth yawned; he stood the centre of a cloud:
    Light changed its hue, retiring from his shroud.[lm]
    Death stood all glassy in his fixed eye;
    His hand was withered, and his veins were dry;
    His foot, in bony whiteness, glittered there,
    Shrunken and sinewless, and ghastly bare;
    From lips that moved not and unbreathing frame,
    Like caverned winds, the hollow accents came.
    Saul saw, and fell to earth, as falls the oak,
    At once, and blasted by the thunder-stroke.[ln]

                    II.

          "Why is my sleep disquieted?
          Who is he that calls the dead?
          Is it thou, O King? Behold,
          Bloodless are these limbs, and cold:[lo]
          Such are mine; and such shall be
          Thine to-morrow, when with me:
          Ere the coming day is done,
          Such shalt thou be--such thy Son.
          Fare thee well, but for a day,
          Then we mix our mouldering clay.
          Thou--thy race, lie pale and low,
          Pierced by shafts of many a bow;
          And the falchion by thy side
          To thy heart thy hand shall guide:
          Crownless--breathless--headless fall,
          Son and Sire--the house of Saul!"[297]

                                                     Seaham, _Feb._, 1815.



            SONG OF SAUL BEFORE HIS LAST BATTLE.

                    I.

    Warriors and chiefs! should the shaft or the sword
    Pierce me in leading the host of the Lord,
    Heed not the corse, though a King's, in your path:[lp]
    Bury your steel in the bosoms of Gath!

                    II.

    Thou who art bearing my buckler and bow,[lq]
    Should the soldiers of Saul look away from the foe,
    Stretch me that moment in blood at thy feet!
    Mine be the doom which they dared not to meet.

                    III.

    Farewell to others, but never we part,
    Heir to my Royalty--Son of my heart![lr]
    Bright is the diadem, boundless the sway,
    Or kingly the death, which awaits us to-day!

                                                             Seaham, 1815.



             "ALL IS VANITY, SAITH THE PREACHER"

                    I.

        Fame, Wisdom, Love, and Power were mine,
          And Health and Youth possessed me;
        My goblets blushed from every vine,
          And lovely forms caressed me;
        I sunned my heart in Beauty's eyes,
          And felt my soul grow tender;
        All Earth can give, or mortal prize,
          Was mine of regal splendour.

                    II.

        I strive to number o'er what days[ls]
          Remembrance can discover,
        Which all that Life or Earth displays
          Would lure me to live over.
        There rose no day, there rolled no hour
          Of pleasure unembittered;[298]
        And not a trapping decked my Power
          That galled not while it glittered.

                    III.[lt]

        The serpent of the field, by art
          And spells, is won from harming;
        But that which coils around the heart,
          Oh! who hath power of charming?
        It will not list to Wisdom's lore,
          Nor Music's voice can lure it;
        But there it stings for evermore
          The soul that must endure it.

                                                             Seaham, 1815.



          WHEN COLDNESS WRAPS THIS SUFFERING CLAY.

                    I.

    When coldness wraps this suffering clay,[lu]
      Ah! whither strays the immortal mind?
    It cannot die, it cannot stay,
      But leaves its darkened dust behind.
    Then, unembodied, doth it trace
      By steps each planet's heavenly way?[lv]
    Or fill at once the realms of space,
      A thing of eyes, that all survey?

                    II.

    Eternal--boundless,--undecayed,
      A thought unseen, but seeing all,
    All, all in earth, or skies displayed,[lw]
      Shall it survey, shall it recall:
    Each fainter trace that Memory holds
      So darkly of departed years,
    In one broad glance the Soul beholds,
      And all, that was, at once appears.

                    III.

    Before Creation peopled earth,
      Its eye shall roll through chaos back;
    And where the farthest heaven had birth,
      The Spirit trace its rising track.
    And where the future mars or makes,
      Its glance dilate o'er all to be,
    While Sun is quenched--or System breaks,
      Fixed in its own Eternity.

                    IV.

    Above or Love--Hope--Hate--or Fear,
      It lives all passionless and pure:
    An age shall fleet like earthly year;
      Its years as moments shall endure.
    Away--away--without a wing,
      O'er all--through all--its thought shall fly,
    A nameless and eternal thing,
      Forgetting what it was to die.

                                                             Seaham, 1815.



                 VISION OF BELSHAZZAR.[299]

                    I.

    The King was on his throne,
      The Satraps thronged the hall:[lx]
    A thousand bright lamps shone
      O'er that high festival.
    A thousand cups of gold,
      In Judah deemed divine--[ly]
    Jehovah's vessels hold
      The godless Heathen's wine!

                    II.

    In that same hour and hall,
      The fingers of a hand
    Came forth against the wall,
      And wrote as if on sand:
    The fingers of a man;--
      A solitary hand
    Along the letters ran,
      And traced them like a wand.

                    III.

    The monarch saw, and shook,
      And bade no more rejoice;
    All bloodless waxed his look,
      And tremulous his voice.
    "Let the men of lore appear,
      The wisest of the earth,
    And expound the words of fear,
      Which mar our royal mirth."

                    IV.

    Chaldea's seers are good,
      But here they have no skill;
    And the unknown letters stood
      Untold and awful still.
    And Babel's men of age
      Are wise and deep in lore;
    But now they were not sage,
      They saw--but knew no more.

                    V.

    A captive in the land,
      A stranger and a youth,[300]
    He heard the King's command,
      He saw that writing's truth.
    The lamps around were bright,
      The prophecy in view;
    He read it on that night,--
      The morrow proved it true.

                    VI.

    "Belshazzar's grave is made,[lz]
      His kingdom passed away.
    He, in the balance weighed,
      Is light and worthless clay;
    The shroud, his robe of state,
      His canopy the stone;
    The Mede is at his gate!
      The Persian on his throne!"



                   SUN OF THE SLEEPLESS!

    Sun of the sleepless! melancholy star!
    Whose tearful beam glows tremulously far,
    That show'st the darkness thou canst not dispel,
    How like art thou to Joy remembered well!
    So gleams the past, the light of other days,
    Which shines, but warms not with its powerless rays:
    A night-beam Sorrow watcheth to behold,
    Distinct, but distant--clear--but, oh how cold!



      WERE MY BOSOM AS FALSE AS THOU DEEM'ST IT TO BE.

                    I.

    Were my bosom as false as thou deem'st it to be,
    I need not have wandered from far Galilee;
    It was but abjuring my creed to efface
    The curse which, thou say'st, is the crime of my race.

                    II.

    If the bad never triumph, then God is with thee!
    If the slave only sin--thou art spotless and free!
    If the Exile on earth is an Outcast on high,
    Live on in thy faith--but in mine I will die.

                    III.

    I have lost for that faith more than thou canst bestow,
    As the God who permits thee to prosper doth know;
    In his hand is my heart and my hope--and in thine
    The land and the life which for him I resign.

                                                             Seaham, 1815.



             HEROD'S LAMENT FOR MARIAMNE.[301]

                    I.

    Oh, Mariamne! now for thee
      The heart for which thou bled'st is bleeding;
    Revenge is lost in Agony[ma]
      And wild Remorse to rage succeeding.[mb]
    Oh, Mariamne! where art thou?
      Thou canst not hear my bitter pleading:[mc]
    Ah! could'st thou--thou would'st pardon now,
      Though Heaven were to my prayer unheeding.

                    II.

    And is she dead?--and did they dare
      Obey my Frenzy's jealous raving?[md]
    My Wrath but doomed my own despair:
      The sword that smote her 's o'er me waving.--
    But thou art cold, my murdered Love!
      And this dark heart is vainly craving[me]
    For he who soars alone above,
      And leaves my soul unworthy saving.

                    III.

    She's gone, who shared my diadem;
      She sunk, with her my joys entombing;
    I swept that flower from Judah's stem,
      Whose leaves for me alone were blooming;
    And mine's the guilt, and mine the hell,
      This bosom's desolation dooming;
    And I have earned those tortures well,[mf]
      Which unconsumed are still consuming!

                                                          _Jan._ 15, 1815.



    ON THE DAY OF THE DESTRUCTION OF JERUSALEM BY TITUS.

                    I.

    From the last hill that looks on thy once holy dome,[mg]
    I beheld thee, oh Sion! when rendered to Rome:[mh]
    'Twas thy last sun went down, and the flames of thy fall
    Flashed back on the last glance I gave to thy wall.

                    II.

    I looked for thy temple--I looked for my home,
    And forgot for a moment my bondage to come;[mi]
    I beheld but the death-fire that fed on thy fane,
    And the fast-fettered hands that made vengeance in vain.

                    III.

    On many an eve, the high spot whence I gazed
    Had reflected the last beam of day as it blazed;
    While I stood on the height, and beheld the decline
    Of the rays from the mountain that shone on thy shrine.

                    IV.

    And now on that mountain I stood on that day,
    But I marked not the twilight beam melting away;
    Oh! would that the lightning had glared in its stead,
    And the thunderbolt burst on the Conqueror's head![mj]

                    V.

    But the Gods of the Pagan shall never profane
    The shrine where Jehovah disdained not to reign;
    And scattered and scorned as thy people may be,
    Our worship, oh Father! is only for thee.

                                                                     1815.



    BY THE RIVERS OF BABYLON WE SAT DOWN AND WEPT.[302]

                    I.

    We sate down and wept by the waters[303]
      Of Babel, and thought of the day
    When our foe, in the hue of his slaughters,
      Made Salem's high places his prey;
    And Ye, oh her desolate daughters!
      Were scattered all weeping away.

                    II.

    While sadly we gazed on the river
      Which rolled on in freedom below,
    They demanded the song; but, oh never
      That triumph the Stranger shall know![mk]
    May this right hand be withered for ever,
      Ere it string our high harp for the foe!

                    III.

    On the willow that harp is suspended,
      Oh Salem! its sound should be free;[ml]
    And the hour when thy glories were ended
      But left me that token of thee:
    And ne'er shall its soft tones be blended
      With the voice of the Spoiler by me!

                                                         _Jan._ 15, 1813.



                "BY THE WATERS OF BABYLON."

                    I.

    In the valley of waters we wept on the day
    When the host of the Stranger made Salem his prey;
    And our heads on our bosoms all droopingly lay,
    And our hearts were so full of the land far away!

                    II.

    The song they demanded in vain--it lay still
    In our souls as the wind that hath died on the hill--
    They called for the harp--but our blood they shall spill
    Ere our right hands shall teach them one tone of their skill.

                    III.

    All stringlessly hung in the willow's sad tree,
    As dead as her dead-leaf, those mute harps must be:
    Our hands may be fettered--our tears still are free
    For our God--and our Glory--and Sion, Oh _Thee!_

                                                                     1815.



              THE DESTRUCTION OF SENNACHERIB.

                    I.

    The Assyrian came down like the wolf on the fold,
    And his cohorts were gleaming in purple and gold;
    And the sheen of their spears was like stars on the sea,
    When the blue wave rolls nightly on deep Galilee.

                    II.

    Like the leaves of the forest when Summer is green,
    That host with their banners at sunset were seen:
    Like the leaves of the forest when Autumn hath blown,[304]
    That host on the morrow lay withered and strown.

                    III.

    For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast,
    And breathed in the face of the foe as he passed;
    And the eyes of the sleepers waxed deadly and chill,
    And their hearts but once heaved--and for ever grew still!

                    IV.

    And there lay the steed with his nostril all wide,
    But through it there rolled not the breath of his pride;
    And the foam of his gasping lay white on the turf,[mm]
    And cold as the spray of the rock-beating surf.[mn]

                    V.

    And there lay the rider distorted and pale,
    With the dew on his brow, and the rust on his mail:[mo]
    And the tents were all silent--the banners alone--
    The lances unlifted--the trumpet unblown.

                    VI.

    And the widows of Ashur are loud in their wail,[mp]
    And the idols are broke in the temple of Baal;
    And the might of the Gentile, unsmote by the sword,[mq]
    Hath melted like snow in the glance of the Lord!

                                                    Seaham, Feb. 17, 1815.



                 A SPIRIT PASSED BEFORE ME.

                         FROM JOB.

                    I.

    A spirit passed before me: I beheld
    The face of Immortality unveiled--
    Deep Sleep came down on every eye save mine--
    And there it stood,--all formless--but divine:
    Along my bones the creeping flesh did quake;
    And as my damp hair stiffened, thus it spake:

                    II.

    "Is man more just than God? Is man more pure
    Than he who deems even Seraphs insecure?
    Creatures of clay--vain dwellers in the dust!
    The moth survives you, and are ye more just?
    Things of a day! you wither ere the night,
    Heedless and blind to Wisdom's wasted light!"

             FAREWELL! IF EVER FONDEST PRAYER.

                    1.

    Farewell! if ever fondest prayer
      For other's weal availed on high,
    Mine will not all be lost in air,
      But waft thy name beyond the sky.
    'Twere vain to speak--to weep--to sigh:
      Oh! more than tears of blood can tell,
    When wrung from Guilt's expiring eye,[305]
      Are in that word--Farewell!--Farewell!

                    2.

    These lips are mute, these eyes are dry;
      But in my breast and in my brain,
    Awake the pangs that pass not by,
      The thought that ne'er shall sleep again.
    My soul nor deigns nor dares complain,
      Though Grief and Passion there rebel:
    I only know we loved in vain--
      I only feel--Farewell!--Farewell!

                    WHEN WE TWO PARTED.

                    1.

    When we two parted
      In silence and tears,
    Half broken-hearted
      To sever for years,
    Pale grew thy cheek and cold,
      Colder thy kiss;
    Truly that hour foretold[mr]
      Sorrow to this.

                    2.

    The dew of the morning[ms]
      Sunk chill on my brow--
    It felt like the warning
      Of what I feel now.
    Thy vows are all broken,[mt]
      And light is thy fame:
    I hear thy name spoken,
      And share in its shame.

                    3.[mu]

    They name thee before me,
      A knell to mine ear;
    A shudder comes o'er me--
      Why wert thou so dear?
    They know not I knew thee,
      Who knew thee too well:--
    Long, long shall I rue thee,
      Too deeply to tell.

                    4.

    In secret we met--
      In silence I grieve.
    That thy heart could forget,
      Thy spirit deceive.
    If I should meet thee[mv]
      After long years,
    How should I greet thee?--
      With silence and tears.

                   [LOVE AND GOLD.[306]]

                    1.

    I cannot talk of Love to thee,
      Though thou art young and free and fair!
    There is a spell thou dost not see,
      That bids a genuine love despair.

                    2.

    And yet that spell invites each youth,
      For thee to sigh, or seem to sigh;
    Makes falsehood wear the garb of truth,
      And Truth itself appear a lie.

                    3.

    If ever Doubt a place possest
      In woman's heart, 'twere wise in thine:
    Admit not Love into thy breast,
      Doubt others' love, nor trust in mine.

                    4.

    Perchance 'tis feigned, perchance sincere,
      But false or true thou canst not tell;
    So much hast thou from all to fear,
      In that unconquerable spell.

                    5.

    Of all the herd that throng around,
      Thy simpering or thy sighing train,
    Come tell me who to thee is bound
      By Love's or Plutus' heavier chain.

                    6.

    In some 'tis Nature, some 'tis Art
      That bids them worship at thy shrine;
    But thou deserv'st a better heart,
      Than they or I can give for thine.

                    7.

    For thee, and such as thee, behold,
      Is Fortune painted truly--blind!
    Who doomed thee to be bought or sold,
      Has proved too bounteous to be kind.

                    8.

    Each day some tempter's crafty suit
      Would woo thee to a loveless bed:
    I see thee to the altar's foot
      A decorated victim led.

                    9.

    Adieu, dear maid! I must not speak
      Whate'er my secret thoughts may be;
    Though thou art all that man can reck
      I dare not talk of Love to _thee_.

    I speak not, I trace not, I breathe not thy name,[mw]
    There is grief in the sound, there is guilt in the fame:
    But the tear which now burns on my cheek may impart
    The deep thoughts that dwell in that silence of heart.

                    2.[mx]

    Too brief for our passion, too long for our peace,
    Were those hours--can their joy or their bitterness cease?
    We repent, we abjure, we will break from our chain,--
    We will part, we will fly to--unite it again!

                    3.

    Oh! thine be the gladness, and mine be the guilt![my]
    Forgive me, adored one!--forsake, if thou wilt;--
    But the heart which is thine shall expire undebased[mz]
    And _man_ shall not break it--whatever _thou_ mayst.[na]

                    4.

    And stern to the haughty, but humble to thee,
    This soul, in its bitterest blackness, shall be:[nb]
    And our days seem as swift, and our moments more sweet,
    With thee by my side, than with worlds at our feet.

                    5.[nc]

    One sigh of thy sorrow, one look of thy love,[nd]
    Shall turn me or fix, shall reward or reprove;
    And the heartless may wonder at all I resign--
    Thy lip shall reply, not to them, but to _mine_.

             ADDRESS INTENDED TO BE RECITED AT
                THE CALEDONIAN MEETING.[308]

    Who hath not glowed above the page where Fame
    Hath fixed high Caledon's unconquered name;
    The mountain-land which spurned the Roman chain,
    And baffled back the fiery-crested Dane,
    Whose bright claymore and hardihood of hand
    No foe could tame--no tyrant could command?
    That race is gone--but still their children breathe,
    And Glory crowns them with redoubled wreath:
    O'er Gael and Saxon mingling banners shine,
    And, England! add their stubborn strength to thine.
    The blood which flowed with Wallace flows as free,
    But now 'tis only shed for Fame and thee!
    Oh! pass not by the northern veteran's claim,
    But give support--the world hath given him fame!

    The humbler ranks, the lowly brave, who bled
    While cheerly following where the Mighty led--[309]
    Who sleep beneath the undistinguished sod
    Where happier comrades in their triumph trod,
    To us bequeath--'tis all their fate allows--
    The sireless offspring and the lonely spouse:
    She on high Albyn's dusky hills may raise
    The tearful eye in melancholy gaze,
    Or view, while shadowy auguries disclose
    The Highland Seer's anticipated woes,
    The bleeding phantom of each martial form
    Dim in the cloud, or darkling in the storm;[310]
    While sad, she chaunts the solitary song,
    The soft lament for him who tarries long--
    For him, whose distant relics vainly crave
    The Coronach's wild requiem to the brave!

    'Tis Heaven--not man--must charm away the woe,
    Which bursts when Nature's feelings newly flow;
    Yet Tenderness and Time may rob the tear
    Of half its bitterness for one so dear;
    A Nation's gratitude perchance may spread
    A thornless pillow for the widowed head;
    May lighten well her heart's maternal care,
    And wean from Penury the soldier's heir;
    Or deem to living war-worn Valour just[311]
    Each wounded remnant--Albion's cherished trust--
    Warm his decline with those endearing rays,
    Whose bounteous sunshine yet may gild his days--
    So shall that Country--while he sinks to rest--
    His hand hath fought for--by his heart be blest!

              ELEGIAC STANZAS ON THE DEATH OF
                SIR PETER PARKER, BART.[312]

                    1.

    There is a tear for all that die,[313]
      A mourner o'er the humblest grave;
    But nations swell the funeral cry,
      And Triumph weeps above the brave.

                    2.

    For them is Sorrow's purest sigh
      O'er Ocean's heaving bosom sent:
    In vain their bones unburied lie,
      All earth becomes their monument!

                    3.

    A tomb is theirs on every page,
      An epitaph on every tongue:
    The present hours, the future age,
      For them bewail, to them belong.

                    4.

    For them the voice of festal mirth
      Grows hushed, _their name_ the only sound;
    While deep Remembrance pours to Worth
      The goblet's tributary round.

                    5.

    A theme to crowds that knew them not,
      Lamented by admiring foes,
    Who would not share their glorious lot?
      Who would not die the death they chose?

                    6.

    And, gallant Parker! thus enshrined
      Thy life, thy fall, thy fame shall be;
    And early valour, glowing, find
      A model in thy memory.

                    7.

    But there are breasts that bleed with thee
      In woe, that glory cannot quell;
    And shuddering hear of victory,
      Where one so dear, so dauntless, fell.

                    8.

    Where shall they turn to mourn thee less?
      When cease to hear thy cherished name?
    Time cannot teach forgetfulness,
      While Grief's full heart is fed by Fame.

                    9.

    Alas! for them, though not for thee,
      They cannot choose but weep the more;
    Deep for the dead the grief must be,
      Who ne'er gave cause to mourn before.

                 JULIAN [A FRAGMENT].[314]

                    1.

    The Night came on the Waters--all was rest
    On Earth--but Rage on Ocean's troubled Heart.
    The Waves arose and rolled beneath the blast;
    The Sailors gazed upon their shivered Mast.
    In that dark Hour a long loud gathered cry
    From out the billows pierced the sable sky,
    And borne o'er breakers reached the craggy shore--
    The Sea roars on--that Cry is heard no more.

                    2.

    There is no vestige, in the Dawning light,
    Of those that shrieked thro' shadows of the Night.
    The Bark--the Crew--the very Wreck is gone,
    Marred--mutilated--traceless--all save one.
    In him there still is Life, the Wave that dashed
    On shore the plank to which his form was lashed,
    Returned unheeding of its helpless Prey--
    The lone survivor of that Yesterday--
    The one of Many whom the withering Gale
    Hath left unpunished to record their Tale.
    But who shall hear it? on that barren Sand
    None comes to stretch the hospitable hand.
    That shore reveals no print of human foot,
    Nor e'en the pawing of the wilder Brute;
    And niggard vegetation will not smile,
    All sunless on that solitary Isle.

                    3.

    The naked Stranger rose, and wrung his hair,
    And that first moment passed in silent prayer.
    Alas! the sound--he sunk into Despair--
    He was on Earth--but what was Earth to him,
    Houseless and homeless--bare both breast and limb?
    Cut off from all but Memory he curst
    His fate--his folly--but himself the worst.
    What was his hope? he looked upon the Wave--
    Despite--of all--it still may be his Grave!

                    4.

    He rose and with a feeble effort shaped
    His course unto the billows--late escaped:
    But weakness conquered--swam his dizzy glance,
    And down to Earth he sunk in silent trance.
    How long his senses bore its chilling chain,
    He knew not--but, recalled to Life again,
    A stranger stood beside his shivering form--
    And what was he? had he too scaped the storm?

                    5.

    He raised young Julian. "Is thy Cup so full
    Of bitterness--thy Hope--thy heart so dull
    That thou shouldst from Thee dash the Draught of Life,
    So late escaped the elemental strife!
    Rise--tho' these shores few aids to Life supply,
    Look upon me, and know thou shalt not die.
    Thou gazest in mute wonder--more may be
    Thy marvel when thou knowest mine and me.
    But come--The bark that bears us hence shall find
    Her Haven, soon, despite the warning Wind."

                    6.

    He raised young Julian from the sand, and such
    Strange power of healing dwelt within the touch,
    That his weak limbs grew light with freshened Power,
    As he had slept not fainted in that hour,
    And woke from Slumber--as the Birds awake,
    Recalled at morning from the branched brake,
    When the day's promise heralds early Spring,
    And Heaven unfolded woos their soaring wing:
    So Julian felt, and gazed upon his Guide,
    With honest Wonder what might next betide.

                                                            Dec. 12, 1814.



                       TO BELSHAZZAR.

                    1.[ne]

    Belshazzar! from the banquet turn,
      Nor in thy sensual fulness fall;
    Behold! while yet before thee burn
      The graven words, the glowing wall,[nf]
    Many a despot men miscall
      Crowned and anointed from on high;
    But thou, the weakest, worst of all--
      Is it not written, thou must die?[ng]

                    2.

    Go! dash the roses from thy brow--
      Grey hairs but poorly wreathe with them;
    Youth's garlands misbecome thee now,
      More than thy very diadem,[nh]
    Where thou hast tarnished every gem:--
      Then throw the worthless bauble by,
    Which, worn by thee, ev'n slaves contemn;
      And learn like better men to die!

                    3.

    Oh! early in the balance weighed,
      And ever light of word and worth,
    Whose soul expired ere youth decayed,
      And left thee but a mass of earth.
    To see thee moves the scorner's mirth:
      But tears in Hope's averted eye
    Lament that even thou hadst birth--
      Unfit to govern, live, or die.

                                                      _February_ 12, 1815.

    "O Lachrymarum fons, tenero sacros
      Ducentium ortus ex animo: quater
        Felix! in imo qui scatentem
           Pectore te, pia Nympha, sensit."

                    1.

    There's not a joy the world can give like that it takes away,
    When the glow of early thought declines in Feeling's dull decay;
    'Tis not on Youth's smooth cheek the blush alone, which fades
                                                        so fast,[ni]
    But the tender bloom of heart is gone, ere Youth itself be past.

                    2.

    Then the few whose spirits float above the wreck of happiness
    Are driven o'er the shoals of guilt or ocean of excess:
    The magnet of their course is gone, or only points in vain
    The shore to which their shivered sail shall never stretch again.

                    3.

    Then the mortal coldness of the soul like Death itself comes down;
    It cannot feel for others' woes, it dare not dream its own;
    That heavy chill has frozen o'er the fountain of our tears,
    And though the eye may sparkle still, 'tis where the ice appears.

                    4.

    Though wit may flash from fluent lips, and mirth distract the breast,
    Through midnight hours that yield no more their former hope of rest;

    Oh, could I feel as I have felt,--or be what I have been,
    Or weep as I could once have wept, o'er many a vanished scene;
    As springs in deserts found seem sweet, all brackish though they be,
    So, midst the withered waste of life, those tears would flow to me.

          ON THE DEATH OF THE DUKE OF DORSET.[317]

                    1.

    I heard thy fate without a tear,
      Thy loss with scarce a sigh;
    And yet thou wast surpassing dear,
      Too loved of all to die.
    I know not what hath seared my eye--
      Its tears refuse to start;
    But every drop, it bids me dry,
      Falls dreary on my heart.

                    2.

    Yes, dull and heavy, one by one,
      They sink and turn to care,
    As caverned waters wear the stone,
      Yet dropping harden there:
    They cannot petrify more fast,
      Than feelings sunk remain,
    Which coldly fixed regard the past,
      But never melt again.

                                                                   [1815.]

    Bright be the place of thy soul!
      No lovelier spirit than thine
    E'er burst from its mortal control,
      In the orbs of the blessed to shine.
    On earth thou wert all but divine,
      As thy soul shall immortally be;[nk]
    And our sorrow may cease to repine
      When we know that thy God is with thee.

                 NAPOLEON'S FAREWELL.[319]

                     [FROM THE FRENCH.]

                    1.

    Farewell to the Land, where the gloom of my Glory
    Arose and o'ershadowed the earth with her name--
    She abandons me now--but the page of her story,
    The brightest or blackest, is filled with my fame.[no]
    I have warred with a World which vanquished me only
    When the meteor of conquest allured me too far;
    I have coped with the nations which dread me thus lonely,
    The last single Captive to millions in war.

                    2.

    Farewell to thee, France! when thy diadem crowned me,
    I made thee the gem and the wonder of earth,--
    But thy weakness decrees I should leave as I found thee,[np]
    Decayed in thy glory, and sunk in thy worth.
    Oh! for the veteran hearts that were wasted
    In strife with the storm, when their battles were won--
    Then the Eagle, whose gaze in that moment was blasted
    Had still soared with eyes fixed on Victory's sun![nq]

                    3.

    Farewell to thee, France!--but when Liberty rallies
    Once more in thy regions, remember me then,--
    The Violet still grows in the depth of thy valleys;
    Though withered, thy tear will unfold it again--
    Yet, yet, I may baffle the hosts that surround us,
    And yet may thy heart leap awake to my voice--
    There are links which must break in the chain that has bound us,
    _Then_ turn thee and call on the Chief of thy choice!

                   FROM THE FRENCH.[320]

                    I.

    Must thou go, my glorious Chief,
      Severed from thy faithful few?
    Who can tell thy warrior's grief,
      Maddening o'er that long adieu?[nr]
    Woman's love, and Friendship's zeal,
      Dear as both have been to me--[ns]
    What are they to all I feel,
      With a soldier's faith for thee?[nt]

                    II.

    Idol of the soldier's soul!
      First in fight, but mightiest now;[nu]
    Many could a world control;
      Thee alone no doom can bow.
    By thy side for years I dared
      Death; and envied those who fell,
    When their dying shout was heard,
      Blessing him they served so well.[321]

                    III.

    Would that I were cold with those,
      Since this hour I live to see;
    When the doubts of coward foes[nv]
      Scarce dare trust a man with thee,
    Dreading each should set thee free!
      Oh! although in dungeons pent,
    All their chains were light to me,
      Gazing on thy soul unbent.

                    IV.

    Would the sycophants of him
      Now so deaf to duty's prayer,[nw]
    Were his borrowed glories dim,
      In his native darkness share?
    Were that world this hour his own,
      All thou calmly dost resign,
    Could he purchase with that throne
      Hearts like those which still are thine?[nx]

                    V.

    My Chief, my King, my Friend, adieu!
      Never did I droop before;
    Never to my Sovereign sue,
      As his foes I now implore:
    All I ask is to divide
      Every peril he must brave;
    Sharing by the hero's side
      His fall--his exile--and his grave.[ny]

                 ODE FROM THE FRENCH.[322]

                    I.

    We do not curse thee, Waterloo!
    Though Freedom's blood thy plain bedew;
    There 'twas shed, but is not sunk--
    Rising from each gory trunk,
    Like the water-spout from ocean,
    With a strong and growing motion--
    It soars, and mingles in the air,
    With that of lost La Bedoyere--[323]
    With that of him whose honoured grave
    Contains the "bravest of the brave."
    A crimson cloud it spreads and glows,
    But shall return to whence it rose;
    When 'tis full 'twill burst asunder--
    Never yet was heard such thunder
    As then shall shake the world with wonder--
    Never yet was seen such lightning
    As o'er heaven shall then be bright'ning!
    Like the Wormwood Star foretold
      By the sainted Seer of old,
    Show'ring down a fiery flood,
    Turning rivers into blood.[324]

                    II.

    The Chief has fallen, but not by you,
    Vanquishers of Waterloo!
    When the soldier citizen
    Swayed not o'er his fellow-men--
    Save in deeds that led them on
    Where Glory smiled on Freedom's son--
    Who, of all the despots banded,
      With that youthful chief competed?
      Who could boast o'er France defeated,
    Till lone Tyranny commanded?
    Till, goaded by Ambition's sting,
    The Hero sunk into the King?
    Then he fell:--so perish all,
    Who would men by man enthral!

                    III.

    And thou, too, of the snow-white plume!
    Whose realm refused thee ev'n a tomb;[325]
    Better hadst thou still been leading
    France o'er hosts of hirelings bleeding,
    Than sold thyself to death and shame
    For a meanly royal name;
    Such as he of Naples wears,
    Who thy blood-bought title bears.
    Little didst thou deem, when dashing
      On thy war-horse through the ranks.
      Like a stream which burst its banks,
    While helmets cleft, and sabres clashing,
    Shone and shivered fast around thee--
    Of the fate at last which found thee:
    Was that haughty plume laid low
    By a slave's dishonest blow?
    Once--as the Moon sways o'er the tide,
    It rolled in air, the warrior's guide;
    Through the smoke-created night
    Of the black and sulphurous fight,
    The soldier raised his seeking eye
    To catch that crest's ascendancy,--
    And, as it onward rolling rose,
    So moved his heart upon our foes.
    There, where death's brief pang was quickest,
    And the battle's wreck lay thickest,
    Strewed beneath the advancing banner
      Of the eagle's burning crest--
    (There with thunder-clouds to fan her,
      _Who_ could then her wing arrest--
      Victory beaming from her breast?)
    While the broken line enlarging
      Fell, or fled along the plain;
    There be sure was Murat charging!
      There he ne'er shall charge again!

                    IV.

    O'er glories gone the invaders march,
    Weeps Triumph o'er each levelled arch--
    But let Freedom rejoice,
    With her heart in her voice;
    But, her hand on her sword,
    Doubly shall she be adored;
    France hath twice too well been taught
    The "moral lesson"[326] dearly bought--
    Her safety sits not on a throne,
    With Capet or Napoleon!
    But in equal rights and laws,
    Hearts and hands in one great cause--
    Freedom, such as God hath given
    Unto all beneath his heaven,
    With their breath, and from their birth,
    Though guilt would sweep it from the earth;
    With a fierce and lavish hand
    Scattering nations' wealth like sand;
    Pouring nations' blood like water,
    In imperial seas of slaughter!

                    V.

    But the heart and the mind,
    And the voice of mankind,
    Shall arise in communion--
    And who shall resist that proud union?
    The time is past when swords subdued--
    Man may die--the soul's renewed:
    Even in this low world of care
    Freedom ne'er shall want an heir;
    Millions breathe but to inherit
    Her for ever bounding spirit--
    When once more her hosts assemble,
    Tyrants shall believe and tremble--
    Smile they at this idle threat?
    Crimson tears will follow yet.[327]

    There be none of Beauty's daughters
      With a magic like thee;
    And like music on the waters
      Is thy sweet voice to me:
    When, as if its sound were causing
    The charmed Ocean's pausing,
    The waves lie still and gleaming,
    And the lulled winds seem dreaming:

                    2.

    And the midnight Moon is weaving
      Her bright chain o'er the deep;
    Whose breast is gently heaving,

    To listen and adore thee;
    With a full but soft emotion,
    Like the swell of Summer's ocean.

        ON THE STAR OF "THE LEGION OF HONOUR."[328]

                     [FROM THE FRENCH.]

                    1.

    Star of the brave!--whose beam hath shed
    Such glory o'er the quick and dead--
    Thou radiant and adored deceit!
    Which millions rushed in arms to greet,--
    Wild meteor of immortal birth!
    Why rise in Heaven to set on Earth?

                    2.

    Souls of slain heroes formed thy rays;
    Eternity flashed through thy blaze;
    The music of thy martial sphere
    Was fame on high and honour here;
    And thy light broke on human eyes,
    Like a Volcano of the skies.

                    3.

    Like lava rolled thy stream of blood,
    And swept down empires with its flood;
    Earth rocked beneath thee to her base,
    As thou didst lighten through all space;
    And the shorn Sun grew dim in air,
    And set while thou wert dwelling there.

                    4.

    Before thee rose, and with thee grew,
    A rainbow of the loveliest hue
    Of three bright colours,[329] each divine,
    And fit for that celestial sign;
    For Freedom's hand had blended them,
    Like tints in an immortal gem.

                    5.

    One tint was of the sunbeam's dyes;
    One, the blue depth of Seraph's eyes;
    One, the pure Spirit's veil of white
    Had robed in radiance of its light:
    The three so mingled did beseem
    The texture of a heavenly dream.

                    6.

    Star of the brave! thy ray is pale,
    And darkness must again prevail!
    But, oh thou Rainbow of the free!
    Our tears and blood must flow for thee.
    When thy bright promise fades away,
    Our life is but a load of clay.

                    7.

    And Freedom hallows with her tread
    The silent cities of the dead;
    For beautiful in death are they
    Who proudly fall in her array;
    And soon, oh, Goddess! may we be
    For evermore with them or thee!

                    THE SIEGE OF CORINTH

    In the year since Jesus died for men,[332]
    Eighteen hundred years and ten,[333]
    We were a gallant company,
    Riding o'er land, and sailing o'er sea.
    Oh! but we went merrily![334]
    We forded the river, and clomb the high hill,
    Never our steeds for a day stood still;
    Whether we lay in the cave or the shed,
    Our sleep fell soft on the hardest bed;
    Whether we couched in our rough capote,[335]                         10
    On the rougher plank of our gliding boat,
    Or stretched on the beach, or our saddles spread,
    As a pillow beneath the resting head,
    Fresh we woke upon the morrow:
      All our thoughts and words had scope,
      We had health, and we had hope,
    Toil and travel, but no sorrow.
    We were of all tongues and creeds;--
    Some were those who counted beads,
    Some of mosque, and some of church,                                  20
      And some, or I mis-say, of neither;
    Yet through the wide world might ye search,
      Nor find a motlier crew nor blither.

    But some are dead, and some are gone,
    And some are scattered and alone,
    And some are rebels on the hills[336]
      That look along Epirus' valleys,
      Where Freedom still at moments rallies,
    And pays in blood Oppression's ills;
      And some are in a far countree,                                    30
    And some all restlessly at home;
      But never more, oh! never, we
    Shall meet to revel and to roam.
    But those hardy days flew cheerily![nz]
    And when they now fall drearily,
    My thoughts, like swallows, skim the main,[337]
    And bear my spirit back again
    Over the earth, and through the air,
    A wild bird and a wanderer.
    'Tis this that ever wakes my strain,                                 40
    And oft, too oft, implores again
    The few who may endure my lay,[oa]
    To follow me so far away.
    Stranger, wilt thou follow now,
    And sit with me on Acro-Corinth's brow?

                    I.[338]

    Many a vanished year and age,[ob]
    And Tempest's breath, and Battle's rage,
    Have swept o'er Corinth; yet she stands,
    A fortress formed to Freedom's hands.[oc]
    The Whirlwind's wrath, the Earthquake's shock,                       50
    Have left untouched her hoary rock,
    The keystone of a land, which still,
    Though fall'n, looks proudly on that hill,
    The landmark to the double tide
    That purpling rolls on either side,
    As if their waters chafed to meet,
    Yet pause and crouch beneath her feet.
    But could the blood before her shed
    Since first Timoleon's brother bled,[339]
    Or baffled Persia's despot fled,                                     60
    Arise from out the Earth which drank
    The stream of Slaughter as it sank,
    That sanguine Ocean would o'erflow
    Her isthmus idly spread below:
    Or could the bones of all the slain,[od]
    Who perished there, be piled again,
    That rival pyramid would rise
    More mountain-like, through those clear skies[oe]
    Than yon tower-capp'd Acropolis,
    Which seems the very clouds to kiss.                                 70

    On dun Cithaeron's ridge appears
    The gleam of twice ten thousand spears;
    And downward to the Isthmian plain,
    From shore to shore of either main,[of]
    The tent is pitched, the Crescent shines
    Along the Moslem's leaguering lines;
    And the dusk Spahi's bands[340] advance
    Beneath each bearded Pacha's glance;
    And far and wide as eye can reach[og]
    The turbaned cohorts throng the beach;                               80
    And there the Arab's camel kneels,
    And there his steed the Tartar wheels;
    The Turcoman hath left his herd,[341]
    The sabre round his loins to gird;
    And there the volleying thunders pour,
    Till waves grow smoother to the roar.
    The trench is dug, the cannon's breath
    Wings the far hissing globe of death;[342]
    Fast whirl the fragments from the wall,
    Which crumbles with the ponderous ball;                              90
    And from that wall the foe replies,
    O'er dusty plain and smoky skies,
    With fares that answer fast and well
    The summons of the Infidel.

                    III.

    But near and nearest to the wall
    Of those who wish and work its fall,
    With deeper skill in War's black art,
    Than Othman's sons, and high of heart
    As any Chief that ever stood
    Triumphant in the fields of blood;                                  100
    From post to post, and deed to deed,
    Fast spurring on his reeking steed,
    Where sallying ranks the trench assail,
    And make the foremost Moslem quail;
    Or where the battery, guarded well,
    Remains as yet impregnable,
    Alighting cheerly to inspire
    The soldier slackening in his fire;
    The first and freshest of the host
    Which Stamboul's Sultan there can boast,                            110
    To guide the follower o'er the field,
    To point the tube, the lance to wield,
    Or whirl around the bickering blade;--
    Was Alp, the Adrian renegade![343]

                    IV.

    From Venice--once a race of worth
    His gentle Sires--he drew his birth;
    But late an exile from her shore,[oh]
    Against his countrymen he bore
    The arms they taught to bear; and now
    The turban girt his shaven brow.                                    120
    Through many a change had Corinth passed
    With Greece to Venice' rule at last;
    And here, before her walls, with those
    To Greece and Venice equal foes,
    He stood a foe, with all the zeal
    Which young and fiery converts feel,
    Within whose heated bosom throngs
    The memory of a thousand wrongs.
    To him had Venice ceased to be
    Her ancient civic boast--"the Free;"                                130
    And in the palace of St. Mark
    Unnamed accusers in the dark
    Within the "Lion's mouth" had placed
    A charge against him uneffaced:[344]
    He fled in time, and saved his life,
    To waste his future years in strife,[oi]
    That taught his land how great her loss
    In him who triumphed o'er the Cross,
    'Gainst which he reared the Crescent high,
    And battled to avenge or die.                                       140

    He sank, regretting not to die,
    But cursed the Christian's victory--
    Coumourgi--can his glory cease,
    That latest conqueror of Greece,
    Till Christian hands to Greece restore
    The freedom Venice gave of yore?                                    150
    A hundred years have rolled away
    Since he refixed the Moslem's sway;
    And now he led the Mussulman,
    And gave the guidance of the van
    To Alp, who well repaid the trust
    By cities levelled with the dust;
    And proved, by many a deed of death,
    How firm his heart in novel faith.

                    VI.

    The walls grew weak; and fast and hot
    Against them poured the ceaseless shot,                             160
    With unabating fury sent
    From battery to battlement;
    And thunder-like the pealing din[oj]
    Rose from each heated culverin;
    And here and there some crackling dome
    Was fired before the exploding bomb;
    And as the fabric sank beneath
    The shattering shell's volcanic breath,
    In red and wreathing columns flashed
    The flame, as loud the ruin crashed,                                170
    Or into countless meteors driven,
    Its earth-stars melted into heaven;[ok]
    Whose clouds that day grew doubly dun,
    Impervious to the hidden sun,
    With volumed smoke that slowly grew[ol]
    To one wide sky of sulphurous hue.

                    VII.

    But not for vengeance, long delayed,
    Alone, did Alp, the renegade,
    The Moslem warriors sternly teach
    His skill to pierce the promised breach:                            180
    Within these walls a Maid was pent
    His hope would win, without consent
    Of that inexorable Sire,
    Whose heart refused him in its ire,
    When Alp, beneath his Christian name,
    Her virgin hand aspired to claim.
    In happier mood, and earlier time,
    While unimpeached for traitorous crime,
    Gayest in Gondola or Hall,
    He glittered through the Carnival;                                  190
    And tuned the softest serenade
    That e'er on Adria's waters played
    At midnight to Italian maid.[om]

                    VIII.

    And many deemed her heart was won;
    For sought by numbers, given to none,
    Had young Francesca's hand remained
    Still by the Church's bonds unchained:
    And when the Adriatic bore
    Lanciotto to the Paynim shore,
    Her wonted smiles were seen to fail,                                200
    And pensive waxed the maid and pale;
    More constant at confessional,
    More rare at masque and festival;
    Or seen at such, with downcast eyes,
    Which conquered hearts they ceased to prize:
    With listless look she seems to gaze:
    With humbler care her form arrays;
    Her voice less lively in the song;
    Her step, though light, less fleet among
    The pairs, on whom the Morning's glance                             210
    Breaks, yet unsated with the dance.

                    IX.

    Sent by the State to guard the land,
    (Which, wrested from the Moslem's hand,[346]
    While Sobieski tamed his pride
    By Buda's wall and Danube's side,[on]
    The chiefs of Venice wrung away
    From Patra to Euboea's bay,)
    Minotti held in Corinth's towers[oo]
    The Doge's delegated powers,
    While yet the pitying eye of Peace                                  220
    Smiled o'er her long forgotten Greece:
    And ere that faithless truce was broke
    Which freed her from the unchristian yoke,
    With him his gentle daughter came;
    Nor there, since Menelaus' dame
    Forsook her lord and land, to prove
    What woes await on lawless love,
    Had fairer form adorned the shore
    Than she, the matchless stranger, bore.[op]

                    X.

    The wall is rent, the ruins yawn;                                   230
    And, with to-morrow's earliest dawn,
    O'er the disjointed mass shall vault
    The foremost of the fierce assault.
    The bands are ranked--the chosen van
    Of Tartar and of Mussulman,
    The full of hope, misnamed "forlorn,"[347]
    Who hold the thought of death in scorn,
    And win their way with falchion's force,
    Or pave the path with many a corse,
    O'er which the following brave may rise,                            240
    Their stepping-stone--the last who dies![oq]

                    XI.

    'Tis midnight: on the mountains brown[348]
    The cold, round moon shines deeply down;
    Blue roll the waters, blue the sky
    Spreads like an ocean hung on high,
    Bespangled with those isles of light,[or][349]
    So wildly, spiritually bright;
    Who ever gazed upon them shining
    And turned to earth without repining,
    Nor wished for wings to flee away,                                  250
    And mix with their eternal ray?
    The waves on either shore lay there
    Calm, clear, and azure as the air;
    And scarce their foam the pebbles shook,
    But murmured meekly as the brook.
    The winds were pillowed on the waves;
    The banners drooped along their staves,
    And, as they fell around them furling,
    Above them shone the crescent curling;
    And that deep silence was unbroke,                                  260
    Save where the watch his signal spoke,
    Save where the steed neighed oft and shrill,
    And echo answered from the hill,
    And the wide hum of that wild host
    Rustled like leaves from coast to coast,
    As rose the Muezzin's voice in air
    In midnight call to wonted prayer;
    It rose, that chanted mournful strain,
    Like some lone Spirit's o'er the plain:
    'Twas musical, but sadly sweet,                                     270
    Such as when winds and harp-strings meet,
    And take a long unmeasured tone,
    To mortal minstrelsy unknown.[os]
    It seemed to those within the wall
    A cry prophetic of their fall:
    It struck even the besieger's ear
    With something ominous and drear,[350]
    An undefined and sudden thrill,
    Which makes the heart a moment still,
    Then beat with quicker pulse, ashamed                               280
    Of that strange sense its silence framed;
    Such as a sudden passing-bell
    Wakes, though but for a stranger's knell.[ot]

                    XII.

    The tent of Alp was on the shore;
    The sound was hushed, the prayer was o'er;
    The watch was set, the night-round made,
    All mandates issued and obeyed:
    'Tis but another anxious night,
    His pains the morrow may requite
    With all Revenge and Love can pay,                                  290
    In guerdon for their long delay.
    Few hours remain, and he hath need
    Of rest, to nerve for many a deed
    Of slaughter; but within his soul
    The thoughts like troubled waters roll.[ou]
    He stood alone among the host;
    Not his the loud fanatic boast
    To plant the Crescent o'er the Cross,
    Or risk a life with little loss,
    Secure in paradise to be                                            300
    By Houris loved immortally:
    Nor his, what burning patriots feel,
    The stern exaltedness of zeal,
    Profuse of blood, untired in toil,
    When battling on the parent soil.
    He stood alone--a renegade
    Against the country he betrayed;
    He stood alone amidst his band,
    Without a trusted heart or hand:
    They followed him, for he was brave,                                310
    And great the spoil he got and gave;
    They crouched to him, for he had skill
    To warp and wield the vulgar will:[ov]
    But still his Christian origin
    With them was little less than sin.
    They envied even the faithless fame
    He earned beneath a Moslem name;
    Since he, their mightiest chief, had been
    In youth a bitter Nazarene.
    They did not know how Pride can stoop,                              320
    When baffled feelings withering droop;
    They did not know how Hate can burn
    In hearts once changed from soft to stern;
    Nor all the false and fatal zeal
    The convert of Revenge can feel.
    He ruled them--man may rule the worst,
    By ever daring to be first:
    So lions o'er the jackals sway;
    The jackal points, he fells the prey,[ow][351]
    Then on the vulgar, yelling, press,                                 330
    To gorge the relics of success.

                    XIII.

    His head grows fevered, and his pulse
    The quick successive throbs convulse;
    In vain from side to side he throws
    His form, in courtship of repose;[ox]
    Or if he dozed, a sound, a start
    Awoke him with a sunken heart.
    The turban on his hot brow pressed,
    The mail weighed lead-like on his breast,
    Though oft and long beneath its weight                              340
    Upon his eyes had slumber sate,
    Without or couch or canopy,
    Except a rougher field and sky[oy]
    Than now might yield a warrior's bed,
    Than now along the heaven was spread.
    He could not rest, he could not stay
    Within his tent to wait for day,[oz]
    But walked him forth along the sand,
    Where thousand sleepers strewed the strand.
    What pillowed them? and why should he                               350
    More wakeful than the humblest be,
    Since more their peril, worse their toil?
    And yet they fearless dream of spoil;
    While he alone, where thousands passed
    A night of sleep, perchance their last,
    In sickly vigil wandered on,
    And envied all he gazed upon.

                    XIV.

    He felt his soul become more light
    Beneath the freshness of the night.
    Cool was the silent sky, though calm,                               360
    And bathed his brow with airy balm:
    Behind, the camp--before him lay,
    In many a winding creek and bay,
    Lepanto's gulf; and, on the brow
    Of Delphi's hill, unshaken snow,[pa]
    High and eternal, such as shone
    Through thousand summers brightly gone,
    Along the gulf, the mount, the clime;
    It will not melt, like man, to time:
    Tyrant and slave are swept away,                                    370
    Less formed to wear before the ray;
    But that white veil, the lightest, frailest,[352]
    Which on the mighty mount thou hailest,
    While tower and tree are torn and rent,
    Shines o'er its craggy battlement;
    In form a peak, in height a cloud,
    In texture like a hovering shroud,
    Thus high by parting Freedom spread,
    As from her fond abode she fled,
    And lingered on the spot, where long                                380
    Her prophet spirit spake in song.[pb]
    Oh! still her step at moments falters
    O'er withered fields, and ruined altars,
    And fain would wake, in souls too broken,
    By pointing to each glorious token:
    But vain her voice, till better days
    Dawn in those yet remembered rays,
    Which shone upon the Persian flying,
    And saw the Spartan smile in dying.

                    XV.

    Not mindless of these mighty times                                  390
    Was Alp, despite his flight and crimes;
    And through this night, as on he wandered,[pc]
    And o'er the past and present pondered,
    And thought upon the glorious dead
    Who there in better cause had bled,
    He felt how faint and feebly dim[pd]
    The fame that could accrue to him,
    Who cheered the band, and waved the sword,[pe]
    A traitor in a turbaned horde;
    And led them to the lawless siege,                                  400
    Whose best success were sacrilege.
    Not so had those his fancy numbered,[353]
    The chiefs whose dust around him slumbered;
    Their phalanx marshalled on the plain,
    Whose bulwarks were not then in vain.
    They fell devoted, but undying;
    The very gale their names seemed sighing;
    The waters murmured of their name;
    The woods were peopled with their fame;
    The silent pillar, lone and grey,                                   410
    Claimed kindred with their sacred clay;
    Their spirits wrapped the dusky mountain,
    Their memory sparkled o'er the fountain;[pf]
    The meanest rill, the mightiest river
    Rolled mingling with their fame for ever.
    Despite of every yoke she bears,
    That land is Glory's still and theirs![pg]
    'Tis still a watch-word to the earth:
    When man would do a deed of worth
    He points to Greece, and turns to tread,                            420
    So sanctioned, on the tyrant's head:
    He looks to her, and rushes on
    Where life is lost, or Freedom won.[ph]

                    XVI.

    Still by the shore Alp mutely mused,
    And wooed the freshness Night diffused.
    There shrinks no ebb in that tideless sea,[354]
    Which changeless rolls eternally;
    So that wildest of waves, in their angriest mood,[pi]
    Scarce break on the bounds of the land for a rood;
    And the powerless moon beholds them flow,                           430
    Heedless if she come or go:
    Calm or high, in main or bay,
    On their course she hath no sway.
    The rock unworn its base doth bare,
    And looks o'er the surf, but it comes not there;
    And the fringe of the foam may be seen below,
    On the line that it left long ages ago:
    A smooth short space of yellow sand[pj][355]
    Between it and the greener land.

    He wandered on along the beach,                                     440
    Till within the range of a carbine's reach
    Of the leaguered wall; but they saw him not,
    Or how could he 'scape from the hostile shot?[pk]
    Did traitors lurk in the Christians' hold?
    Were their hands grown stiff, or their hearts waxed cold?
    I know not, in sooth; but from yonder wall[pl]
    There flashed no fire, and there hissed no ball,
    Though he stood beneath the bastion's frown,
    That flanked the seaward gate of the town;
    Though he heard the sound, and could almost tell                    450
    The sullen words of the sentinel,
    As his measured step on the stone below
    Clanked, as he paced it to and fro;
    And he saw the lean dogs beneath the wall
    Hold o'er the dead their Carnival,[356]
    Gorging and growling o'er carcass and limb;
    They were too busy to bark at him!
    From a Tartar's skull they had stripped the flesh,
    As ye peel the fig when its fruit is fresh;
    And their white tusks crunched o'er the whiter skull,[357]          460
    As it slipped through their jaws, when their edge grew dull,
    As they lazily mumbled the bones of the dead,
    When they scarce could rise from the spot where they fed;
    So well had they broken a lingering fast
    With those who had fallen for that night's repast.
    And Alp knew, by the turbans that rolled on the sand,
    The foremost of these were the best of his band:
    Crimson and green were the shawls of their wear,
    And each scalp had a single long tuft of hair,[358]
    All the rest was shaven and bare.                                   470
    The scalps were in the wild dog's maw,
    The hair was tangled round his jaw:
    But close by the shore, on the edge of the gulf,
    There sat a vulture flapping a wolf,
    Who had stolen from the hills, but kept away,
    Scared by the dogs, from the human prey;
    But he seized on his share of a steed that lay,
    Picked by the birds, on the sands of the bay.

                    XVII.

    Alp turned him from the sickening sight:
    Never had shaken his nerves in fight;                               480
    But he better could brook to behold the dying,
    Deep in the tide of their warm blood lying,[pm][359]
    Scorched with the death-thirst, and writhing in vain,
    Than the perishing dead who are past all pain.[pn][360]
    There is something of pride in the perilous hour,
    Whate'er be the shape in which Death may lower;
    For Fame is there to say who bleeds,
    And Honour's eye on daring deeds![361]
    But when all is past, it is humbling to tread[po]
    O'er the weltering field of the tombless dead,[362]                 490
    And see worms of the earth, and fowls of the air,
    Beasts of the forest, all gathering there;
    All regarding man as their prey,
    All rejoicing in his decay.[pp]

                    XVIII.

    There is a temple in ruin stands,
    Fashioned by long forgotten hands;
    Two or three columns, and many a stone,
    Marble and granite, with grass o'ergrown!
    Out upon Time! it will leave no more
    Of the things to come than the things before![pq][363]              500
    Out upon Time! who for ever will leave
    But enough of the past for the future to grieve
    O'er that which hath been, and o'er that which must be:
    What we have seen, our sons shall see;
    Remnants of things that have passed away,
    Fragments of stone, reared by creatures of clay![pr]

                    XIX.

    He sate him down at a pillar's base,[364]
    And passed his hand athwart his face;
    Like one in dreary musing mood,
    Declining was his attitude;                                         510
    His head was drooping on his breast,
    Fevered, throbbing, and oppressed;
    And o'er his brow, so downward bent,
    Oft his beating fingers went,
    Hurriedly, as you may see
    Your own run over the ivory key,
    Ere the measured tone is taken
    By the chords you would awaken.
    There he sate all heavily,
    As he heard the night-wind sigh.                                    520
    Was it the wind through some hollow stone,[ps]
    Sent that soft and tender moan?[365]
    He lifted his head, and he looked on the sea,
    But it was unrippled as glass may be;
    He looked on the long grass--it waved not a blade;
    How was that gentle sound conveyed?
    He looked to the banners--each flag lay still,
    So did the leaves on Cithaeron's hill,
    And he felt not a breath come over his cheek;
    What did that sudden sound bespeak?                                 530
    He turned to the left--is he sure of sight?
    There sate a lady, youthful and bright![pt][366]

                    XX.

    He started up with more of fear
    Than if an armed foe were near.
    "God of my fathers! what is here?
    Who art thou? and wherefore sent
    So near a hostile armament?"
    His trembling hands refused to sign
    The cross he deemed no more divine:
    He had resumed it in that hour,[pu]                                 540
    But Conscience wrung away the power.
    He gazed, he saw; he knew the face
    Of beauty, and the form of grace;
    It was Francesca by his side,
    The maid who might have been his bride![pv]


    The rose was yet upon her cheek,
    But mellowed with a tenderer streak:
    Where was the play of her soft lips fled?
    Gone was the smile that enlivened their red.
    The Ocean's calm within their view,[pw]                             550
    Beside her eye had less of blue;
    But like that cold wave it stood still,
    And its glance, though clear, was chill.[367]
    Around her form a thin robe twining,
    Nought concealed her bosom shining;
    Through the parting of her hair,
    Floating darkly downward there,
    Her rounded arm showed white and bare:
    And ere yet she made reply,
    Once she raised her hand on high;                                   560
    It was so wan, and transparent of hue,
    You might have seen the moon shine through.

                    XXI.

    "I come from my rest to him I love best,
    That I may be happy, and he may be blessed.
    I have passed the guards, the gate, the wall;
    Sought thee in safety through foes and all.
    'Tis said the lion will turn and flee[368]
    From a maid in the pride of her purity;
    And the Power on high, that can shield the good
    Thus from the tyrant of the wood,                                   570
    Hath extended its mercy to guard me as well
    From the hands of the leaguering Infidel.
    I come--and if I come in vain,
    Never, oh never, we meet again!
    Thou hast done a fearful deed
    In falling away from thy fathers' creed:
    But dash that turban to earth, and sign
    The sign of the cross, and for ever be mine;
    Wring the black drop from thy heart,
    And to-morrow unites us no more to part."          580

    "And where should our bridal couch be spread?
    In the midst of the dying and the dead?
    For to-morrow we give to the slaughter and flame
    The sons and the shrines of the Christian name.
    None, save thou and thine, I've sworn,
    Shall be left upon the morn:
    But thee will I bear to a lovely spot,
    Where our hands shall be joined, and our sorrow forgot.
    There thou yet shall be my bride,
    When once again I've quelled the pride                              590
    Of Venice; and her hated race
    Have felt the arm they would debase
    Scourge, with a whip of scorpions, those
    Whom Vice and Envy made my foes."

    Upon his hand she laid her own--
    Light was the touch, but it thrilled to the bone,
    And shot a chillness to his heart,[px]
    Which fixed him beyond the power to start.
    Though slight was that grasp so mortal cold,
    He could not loose him from its hold;                               600
    But never did clasp of one so dear
    Strike on the pulse with such feeling of fear,
    As those thin fingers, long and white,
    Froze through his blood by their touch that night.
    The feverish glow of his brow was gone,
    And his heart sank so still that it felt like stone,
    As he looked on the face, and beheld its hue,[py]
    So deeply changed from what he knew:
    Fair but faint--without the ray
    Of mind, that made each feature play                                610
    Like sparkling waves on a sunny day;
    And her motionless lips lay still as death,
    And her words came forth without her breath,
    And there rose not a heave o'er her bosom's swell,[pz]
    And there seemed not a pulse in her veins to dwell.
    Though her eye shone out, yet the lids were fixed,[369]
    And the glance that it gave was wild and unmixed
    With aught of change, as the eyes may seem
    Of the restless who walk in a troubled dream;
    Like the figures on arras, that gloomily glare,                     620
    Stirred by the breath of the wintry air[qa]
    So seen by the dying lamp's fitful light,[qb]
    Lifeless, but life-like, and awful to sight;
    As they seem, through the dimness, about to come down
    From the shadowy wall where their images frown;
    Fearfully flitting to and fro,
    As the gusts on the tapestry come and go.[370]

    "If not for love of me be given
    Thus much, then, for the love of Heaven,--
    Again I say--that turban tear                                       630
    From off thy faithless brow, and swear
    Thine injured country's sons to spare,
    Or thou art lost; and never shalt see--
    Not earth--that's past--but Heaven or me.
    If this thou dost accord, albeit
    A heavy doom' tis thine to meet,
    That doom shall half absolve thy sin,
    And Mercy's gate may receive thee within:[371]
    But pause one moment more, and take
    The curse of Him thou didst forsake;                                640
    And look once more to Heaven, and see
    Its love for ever shut from thee.
    There is a light cloud by the moon--[372]
    'Tis passing, and will pass full soon--
    If, by the time its vapoury sail
    Hath ceased her shaded orb to veil,
    Thy heart within thee is not changed,
    Then God and man are both avenged;
    Dark will thy doom be, darker still
    Thine immortality of ill."                                          650

    Alp looked to heaven, and saw on high
    The sign she spake of in the sky;
    But his heart was swollen, and turned aside,
    By deep interminable pride.[qc]
    This first false passion of his breast
    Rolled like a torrent o'er the rest.
    _He_ sue for mercy! _He_ dismayed
    By wild words of a timid maid!
    _He_, wronged by Venice, vow to save
    Her sons, devoted to the grave!                                     660
    No--though that cloud were thunder's worst,
    And charged to crush him--let it burst!

    He looked upon it earnestly,
    Without an accent of reply;
    He watched it passing; it is flown:
    Full on his eye the clear moon shone,
    And thus he spake--"Whate'er my fate,
    I am no changeling--'tis too late:
    The reed in storms may bow and quiver,
    Then rise again; the tree must shiver.                              670
    What Venice made me, I must be,
    Her foe in all, save love to thee:
    But thou art safe: oh, fly with me!"
    He turned, but she is gone!
    Nothing is there but the column stone.
    Hath she sunk in the earth, or melted in air?
    He saw not--he knew not--but nothing is there.

                    XXII.

    The night is past, and shines the sun
    As if that morn were a jocund one.[373]
    Lightly and brightly breaks away                                    680
    The Morning from her mantle grey,[374]
    And the Noon will look on a sultry day.[375]
    Hark to the trump, and the drum,
    And the mournful sound of the barbarous horn,
    And the flap of the banners, that flit as they're borne,
    And the neigh of the steed, and the multitude's hum,
    And the clash, and the shout, "They come! they come!"
    The horsetails[376] are plucked from the ground, and the sword
    From its sheath; and they form, and but wait for the word.
    Tartar, and Spahi, and Turcoman,                                    690
    Strike your tents, and throng to the van;
    Mount ye, spur ye, skirr the plain,[377]
    That the fugitive may flee in vain,
    When he breaks from the town; and none escape,
    Aged or young, in the Christian shape;
    While your fellows on foot, in a fiery mass,
    Bloodstain the breach through which they pass.[378]
    The steeds are all bridled, and snort to the rein;
    Curved is each neck, and flowing each mane;
    White is the foam of their champ on the bit;                        700
    The spears are uplifted; the matches are lit;
    The cannon are pointed, and ready to roar,
    And crush the wall they have crumbled before:[379]
    Forms in his phalanx each Janizar;
    Alp at their head; his right arm is bare,
    So is the blade of his scimitar;
    The Khan and the Pachas are all at their post;
    The Vizier himself at the head of the host.
    When the culverin's signal is fired, then on;
    Leave not in Corinth a living one--                                 710
    A priest at her altars, a chief in her halls,
    A hearth in her mansions, a stone on her walls.
    God and the prophet--Alla Hu![380]
    Up to the skies with that wild halloo!
    "There the breach lies for passage, the ladder to scale;
    And your hands on your sabres, and how should ye fail?
    He who first downs with the red cross may crave[381]
    His heart's dearest wish; let him ask it, and have!"
    Thus uttered Coumourgi, the dauntless Vizier;[382]
    The reply was the brandish of sabre and spear,                      720
    And the shout of fierce thousands in joyous ire:--
    Silence--hark to the signal--fire!

                    XXIII.

    As the wolves, that headlong go
    On the stately buffalo,
    Though with fiery eyes, and angry roar,
    And hoofs that stamp, and horns that gore,
    He tramples on earth, or tosses on high
    The foremost, who rush on his strength but to die
    Thus against the wall they went,
    Thus the first were backward bent;[383]                             730
    Many a bosom, sheathed in brass,
    Strewed the earth like broken glass,[qd]
    Shivered by the shot, that tore
    The ground whereon they moved no more:
    Even as they fell, in files they lay,
    Like the mower's grass at the close of day,[qe]
    When his work is done on the levelled plain;
    Such was the fall of the foremost slain.[384]

                    XXIV.

    As the spring-tides, with heavy plash,
    From the cliffs invading dash                                       740
    Huge fragments, sapped by the ceaseless flow,
    Till white and thundering down they go,
    Like the avalanche's snow
    On the Alpine vales below;
    Thus at length, outbreathed and worn,
    Corinth's sons were downward borne
    By the long and oft renewed
    Charge of the Moslem multitude.
    In firmness they stood, and in masses they fell,
    Heaped by the host of the Infidel,                                  750
    Hand to hand, and foot to foot:
    Nothing there, save Death, was mute;[385]
    Stroke, and thrust, and flash, and cry
    For quarter, or for victory,
    Mingle there with the volleying thunder,
    Which makes the distant cities wonder
    How the sounding battle goes,
    If with them, or for their foes;
    If they must mourn, or may rejoice
    In that annihilating voice,                                         760
    Which pierces the deep hills through and through
    With an echo dread and new:
    You might have heard it, on that day,
    O'er Salamis and Megara;
    (We have heard the hearers say,)[qf]
    Even unto Piraeus' bay.

                    XXV.

    From the point of encountering blades to the hilt,
    Sabres and swords with blood were gilt;[386]
    But the rampart is won, and the spoil begun,
    And all but the after carnage done.                                 770
    Shriller shrieks now mingling come
    From within the plundered dome:
    Hark to the haste of flying feet,
    That splash in the blood of the slippery street;
    But here and there, where 'vantage ground
    Against the foe may still be found,
    Desperate groups, of twelve or ten,
    Make a pause, and turn again--
    With banded backs against the wall,
    Fiercely stand, or fighting fall.                                   780
    There stood an old man[387]--his hairs were white,
    But his veteran arm was full of might:
    So gallantly bore he the brunt of the fray,
    The dead before him, on that day,
    In a semicircle lay;
    Still he combated unwounded,
    Though retreating, unsurrounded.
    Many a scar of former fight
    Lurked[388] beneath his corslet bright;
    But of every wound his body bore,                                   790
    Each and all had been ta'en before:
    Though aged, he was so iron of limb,
    Few of our youth could cope with him,
    And the foes, whom he singly kept at bay,
    Outnumbered his thin hairs[389] of silver grey.
    From right to left his sabre swept:
    Many an Othman mother wept
    Sons that were unborn, when dipped[390]
    His weapon first in Moslem gore,
    Ere his years could count a score.                                  800
    Of all he might have been the sire[391]
    Who fell that day beneath his ire:
    For, sonless left long years ago,
    His wrath made many a childless foe;
    And since the day, when in the strait[392]
    His only boy had met his fate,
    His parent's iron hand did doom
    More than a human hecatomb.[393]
    If shades by carnage be appeased,
    Patroclus' spirit less was pleased                                  810
    Than his, Minotti's son, who died
    Where Asia's bounds and ours divide.
    Buried he lay, where thousands before
    For thousands of years were inhumed on the shore;
    What of them is left, to tell
    Where they lie, and how they fell?
    Not a stone on their turf, nor a bone in their graves;
    But they live in the verse that immortally saves.[394]

                    XXVI.

    Hark to the Allah shout![395] a band
    Of the Mussulman bravest and best is at hand;                       820
    Their leader's nervous arm is bare,
    Swifter to smite, and never to spare--
    Unclothed to the shoulder it waves them on;
    Thus in the fight is he ever known:
    Others a gaudier garb may show,
    To tempt the spoil of the greedy foe;
    Many a hand's on a richer hilt,
    But none on a steel more ruddily gilt;
    Many a loftier turban may wear,--
    Alp is but known by the white arm bare;                             830
    Look through the thick of the fight,'tis there!
    There is not a standard on that shore
    So well advanced the ranks before;
    There is not a banner in Moslem war
    Will lure the Delhis half so far;
    It glances like a falling star!
    Where'er that mighty arm is seen,
    The bravest be, or late have been;[396]
    There the craven cries for quarter
    Vainly to the vengeful Tartar;                                      840
    Or the hero, silent lying,
    Scorns to yield a groan in dying;
    Mustering his last feeble blow
    'Gainst the nearest levelled foe,
    Though faint beneath the mutual wound,
    Grappling on the gory ground.

                    XXVII.

    Still the old man stood erect.
    And Alp's career a moment checked.
    "Yield thee, Minotti; quarter take,
    For thine own, thy daughter's sake."                                850

    "Never, Renegado, never!
    Though the life of thy gift would last for ever."[qg]

    "Francesca!--Oh, my promised bride![qh]
    Must she too perish by thy pride!"

    "She is safe."--"Where? where?"--"In Heaven;
    From whence thy traitor soul is driven--
    Far from thee, and undefiled."
    Grimly then Minotti smiled,
    As he saw Alp staggering bow
    Before his words, as with a blow.                                   860

    "Oh God! when died she?"--"Yesternight--
    Nor weep I for her spirit's flight:
    None of my pure race shall be
    Slaves to Mahomet and thee--
    Come on!"--That challenge is in vain--
    Alp's already with the slain!
    While Minotti's words were wreaking
    More revenge in bitter speaking
    Than his falchion's point had found,
    Had the time allowed to wound,                                      870
    From within the neighbouring porch
    Of a long defended church,
    Where the last and desperate few
    Would the failing fight renew,
    The sharp shot dashed Alp to the ground;
    Ere an eye could view the wound
    That crashed through the brain of the infidel,
    Round he spun, and down he fell;
    A flash like fire within his eyes
    Blazed, as he bent no more to rise,                                 880
    And then eternal darkness sunk
    Through all the palpitating trunk;[qi]
    Nought of life left, save a quivering
    Where his limbs were slightly shivering:
    They turned him on his back; his breast
    And brow were stained with gore and dust,
    And through his lips the life-blood oozed,
    From its deep veins lately loosed;
    But in his pulse there was no throb,
    Nor on his lips one dying sob;                                      890
    Sigh, nor word, nor struggling breath[qj]
    Heralded his way to death:
    Ere his very thought could pray,
    Unaneled he passed away,
    Without a hope from Mercy's aid,--
    To the last a Renegade.[397]

                    XXVIII.

    Fearfully the yell arose
    Of his followers, and his foes;
    These in joy, in fury those:[qk]
    Then again in conflict mixing,[ql]                                  900
    Clashing swords, and spears transfixing,
    Interchanged the blow and thrust,
    Hurling warriors in the dust.
    Street by street, and foot by foot,
    Still Minotti dares dispute
    The latest portion of the land
    Left beneath his high command;
    With him, aiding heart and hand,
    The remnant of his gallant band.
    Still the church is tenable,                                        910
      Whence issued late the fated ball
      That half avenged the city's fall,
    When Alp, her fierce assailant, fell:
    Thither bending sternly back,
    They leave before a bloody track;
    And, with their faces to the foe,
    Dealing wounds with every blow,[398]
    The chief, and his retreating train,
    Join to those within the fane;
    There they yet may breathe awhile,                                  920
    Sheltered by the massy pile.

                    XXIX.

    Brief breathing-time! the turbaned host,
    With added ranks and raging boast,
    Press onwards with such strength and heat,
    Their numbers balk their own retreat;
    For narrow the way that led to the spot
    Where still the Christians yielded not;
    And the foremost, if fearful, may vainly try
    Through the massy column to turn and fly;
    They perforce must do or die.                                       930
    They die; but ere their eyes could close,
    Avengers o'er their bodies rose;
    Fresh and furious, fast they fill
    The ranks unthinned, though slaughtered still;
    And faint the weary Christians wax
    Before the still renewed attacks:
    And now the Othmans gain the gate;
    Still resists its iron weight,
    And still, all deadly aimed and hot,
    From every crevice comes the shot;                                  940
    From every shattered window pour
    The volleys of the sulphurous shower:
    But the portal wavering grows and weak--
    The iron yields, the hinges creak--
    It bends--it falls--and all is o'er;
    Lost Corinth may resist no more!

                    XXX.

    Darkly, sternly, and all alone,
    Minotti stood o'er the altar stone:
    Madonna's face upon him shone,[399]
    Painted in heavenly hues above,                                     950
    With eyes of light and looks of love;
    And placed upon that holy shrine
    To fix our thoughts on things divine,
    When pictured there, we kneeling see
    Her, and the boy-God on her knee,
    Smiling sweetly on each prayer
    To Heaven, as if to waft it there.
    Still she smiled; even now she smiles,
    Though slaughter streams along her aisles:
    Minotti lifted his aged eye,                                        960
    And made the sign of a cross with a sigh,
    Then seized a torch which blazed thereby;
    And still he stood, while with steel and flame,
    Inward and onward the Mussulman came.

                    XXXI.

    The vaults beneath the mosaic stone[qm]
    Contained the dead of ages gone;
    Their names were on the graven floor,
    But now illegible with gore;[qn]
    The carved crests, and curious hues
    The varied marble's veins diffuse,                                  970
    Were smeared, and slippery--stained, and strown
    With broken swords, and helms o'erthrown:
    There were dead above, and the dead below
    Lay cold in many a coffined row;
    You might see them piled in sable state,
    By a pale light through a gloomy grate;
    But War had entered their dark caves,[qo]
    And stored along the vaulted graves
    Her sulphurous treasures, thickly spread
    In masses by the fleshless dead:                                    980
    Here, throughout the siege, had been
    The Christians' chiefest magazine;
    To these a late formed train now led,
    Minotti's last and stern resource
    Against the foe's o'erwhelming force.

                    XXXII.

    The foe came on, and few remain
    To strive, and those must strive in vain:
    For lack of further lives, to slake
    The thirst of vengeance now awake,
    With barbarous blows they gash the dead,                            990
    And lop the already lifeless head,
    And fell the statues from their niche,
    And spoil the shrines of offerings rich,
    And from each other's rude hands wrest
    The silver vessels Saints had blessed.
    To the high altar on they go;
    Oh, but it made a glorious show![400]
    On its table still behold
    The cup of consecrated gold;
    Massy and deep, a glittering prize,                                1000
    Brightly it sparkles to plunderers' eyes:
    That morn it held the holy wine,[qp]
    Converted by Christ to his blood so divine,
    Which his worshippers drank at the break of day,[qq]
    To shrive their souls ere they joined in the fray.
    Still a few drops within it lay;
    And round the sacred table glow
    Twelve lofty lamps, in splendid row,
    From the purest metal cast;
    A spoil--the richest, and the last.                                1010

                    XXXIII.

    So near they came, the nearest stretched
    To grasp the spoil he almost reached
      When old Minotti's hand
    Touched with the torch the train--
        'Tis fired![401]
    Spire, vaults, the shrine, the spoil, the slain,
      The turbaned victors, the Christian band,
    All that of living or dead remain,
    Hurled on high with the shivered fane,
        In one wild roar expired![402]                                 1020
    The shattered town--the walls thrown down--
    The waves a moment backward bent--
    The hills that shake, although unrent,[qr]
      As if an Earthquake passed--
    The thousand shapeless things all driven
    In cloud and flame athwart the heaven,
      By that tremendous blast--
    Proclaimed the desperate conflict o'er
    On that too long afflicted shore:[403]
    Up to the sky like rockets go                                      1030
    All that mingled there below:
    Many a tall and goodly man,
    Scorched and shrivelled to a span,
    When he fell to earth again
    Like a cinder strewed the plain:
    Down the ashes shower like rain;
    Some fell in the gulf, which received the sprinkles
    With a thousand circling wrinkles;
    Some fell on the shore, but, far away,
    Scattered o'er the isthmus lay;                                    1040
    Christian or Moslem, which be they?
    Let their mothers see and say![qs]
    When in cradled rest they lay,
    And each nursing mother smiled
    On the sweet sleep of her child,
    Little deemed she such a day
    Would rend those tender limbs away.[404]
    Not the matrons that them bore
    Could discern their offspring more;[405]
    That one moment left no trace                                      1050
    More of human form or face
    Save a scattered scalp or bone:
    And down came blazing rafters, strown
    Around, and many a falling stone,[qt]
    Deeply dinted in the clay,
    All blackened there and reeking lay.
    All the living things that heard
    The deadly earth-shock disappeared:
    The wild birds flew; the wild dogs fled,
    And howling left the unburied dead;[qu][406]                       1060
    The camels from their keepers broke;
    The distant steer forsook the yoke--
    The nearer steed plunged o'er the plain,
    And burst his girth, and tore his rein;
    The bull-frog's note, from out the marsh,
    Deep-mouthed arose, and doubly harsh;[407]
    The wolves yelled on the caverned hill
    Where Echo rolled in thunder still;[qv]
    The jackal's troop, in gathered cry,[qw][408]
    Bayed from afar complainingly,                                     1070
    With a mixed and mournful sound,[qx]
    Like crying babe, and beaten hound:[409]
    With sudden wing, and ruffled breast,
    The eagle left his rocky nest,
    And mounted nearer to the sun,
    The clouds beneath him seemed so dun;
    Their smoke assailed his startled beak,
    And made him higher soar and shriek--
      Thus was Corinth lost and won![410]


                       PARISINA.[412]

                    I.

    It is the hour when from the boughs[413]
      The nightingale's high note is heard;
    It is the hour when lovers' vows
      Seem sweet in every whispered word;
    And gentle winds, and waters near,
    Make music to the lonely ear.
    Each flower the dews have lightly wet,
    And in the sky the stars are met,
    And on the wave is deeper blue,
    And on the leaf a browner hue,                                       10
    And in the heaven that clear obscure,
    So softly dark, and darkly pure,
    Which follows the decline of day,
    As twilight melts beneath the moon away.[414]

                    II.

    But it is not to list to the waterfall[qy]
    That Parisina leaves her hall,
    And it is not to gaze on the heavenly light
    That the Lady walks in the shadow of night;
    And if she sits in Este's bower,
    'Tis not for the sake of its full-blown flower;                      20
    She listens--but not for the nightingale--
    Though her ear expects as soft a tale.
    There glides a step through the foliage thick,[qz]
    And her cheek grows pale, and her heart beats quick.
    There whispers a voice through the rustling leaves,
    And her blush returns, and her bosom heaves:
    A moment more--and they shall meet--
    'Tis past--her Lover's at her feet.

                    III.

    And what unto them is the world beside,
    With all its change of time and tide?                                30
    Its living things--its earth and sky--
    Are nothing to their mind and eye.
    And heedless as the dead are they
      Of aught around, above, beneath;
    As if all else had passed away,
      They only for each other breathe;
    Their very sighs are full of joy
      So deep, that did it not decay,
    That happy madness would destroy
      The hearts which feel its fiery sway:                              40
    Of guilt, of peril, do they deem
    In that tumultuous tender dream?
    Who that have felt that passion's power,
    Or paused, or feared in such an hour?
    Or thought how brief such moments last?
    But yet--they are already past!
    Alas! we must awake before
    We know such vision comes no more.

                    IV.

    With many a lingering look they leave
      The spot of guilty gladness past:                                  50
    And though they hope, and vow, they grieve,
      As if that parting were the last.
    The frequent sigh--the long embrace--
      The lip that there would cling for ever,
    While gleams on Parisina's face
      The Heaven she fears will not forgive her,
    As if each calmly conscious star
    Beheld her frailty from afar--
    The frequent sigh, the long embrace,
    Yet binds them to their trysting-place.                              60
    But it must come, and they must part
    In fearful heaviness of heart,
    With all the deep and shuddering chill
    Which follows fast the deeds of ill.

                    V.

    And Hugo is gone to his lonely bed,
      To covet there another's bride;
    But she must lay her conscious head
      A husband's trusting heart beside.
    But fevered in her sleep she seems,
    And red her cheek with troubled dreams,                              70
      And mutters she in her unrest
    A name she dare not breathe by day,[415]
      And clasps her Lord unto the breast
    Which pants for one away:
    And he to that embrace awakes,
    And, happy in the thought, mistakes
    That dreaming sigh, and warm caress,
    For such as he was wont to bless;
    And could in very fondness weep
    O'er her who loves him even in sleep.                                80

                    VI.

    He clasped her sleeping to his heart,
      And listened to each broken word:
    He hears--Why doth Prince Azo start,
      As if the Archangel's voice he heard?
    And well he may--a deeper doom
    Could scarcely thunder o'er his tomb,
    When he shall wake to sleep no more,
    And stand the eternal throne before.
    And well he may--his earthly peace
    Upon that sound is doomed to cease.                                  90
    That sleeping whisper of a name
    Bespeaks her guilt and Azo's shame.
    And whose that name? that o'er his pillow
    Sounds fearful as the breaking billow,
    Which rolls the plank upon the shore,
      And dashes on the pointed rock
    The wretch who sinks to rise no more,--
      So came upon his soul the shock.
    And whose that name?--'tis Hugo's,--his--
    In sooth he had not deemed of this!--                               100
    'Tis Hugo's,--he, the child of one
    He loved--his own all-evil son--
    The offspring of his wayward youth,
    When he betrayed Bianca's truth,[ra][416]
    The maid whose folly could confide
    In him who made her not his bride.

                    VII.

    He plucked his poniard in its sheath,
      But sheathed it ere the point was bare;
    Howe'er unworthy now to breathe,
      He could not slay a thing so fair--                               110
      At least, not smiling--sleeping--there--
    Nay, more:--he did not wake her then,
      But gazed upon her with a glance
      Which, had she roused her from her trance,
    Had frozen her sense to sleep again;
    And o'er his brow the burning lamp
    Gleamed on the dew-drops big and damp.
    She spake no more--but still she slumbered--
    While, in his thought, her days are numbered.

                    VIII.

    And with the morn he sought and found,                              120
    In many a tale from those around,
    The proof of all he feared to know,
    Their present guilt--his future woe;
    The long-conniving damsels seek
      To save themselves, and would transfer
      The guilt--the shame--the doom--to her:
    Concealment is no more--they speak
    All circumstance which may compel
    Full credence to the tale they tell:
    And Azo's tortured heart and ear                                    130
    Have nothing more to feel or hear.

                    IX.

    He was not one who brooked delay:
      Within the chamber of his state,
    The Chief of Este's ancient sway
      Upon his throne of judgement sate;
    His nobles and his guards are there,--
    Before him is the sinful pair;
    Both young,--and _one_ how passing fair!
    With swordless belt, and fettered hand,
    Oh, Christ! that thus a son should stand                            140
      Before a father's face!
    Yet thus must Hugo meet his sire,
    And hear the sentence of his ire,
      The tale of his disgrace!
    And yet he seems not overcome,
    Although, as yet, his voice be dumb.

                    X.

    And still,--and pale--and silently
      Did Parisina wait her doom;
    How changed since last her speaking eye
      Glanced gladness round the glittering room,                       150
    Where high-born men were proud to wait--
    Where Beauty watched to imitate
      Her gentle voice--her lovely mien--
    And gather from her air and gait
      The graces of its Queen:
    Then,--had her eye in sorrow wept,
    A thousand warriors forth had leapt,
    A thousand swords had sheathless shone,
    And made her quarrel all their own.[417]
    Now,--what is she? and what are they?                               160
    Can she command, or these obey?
    All silent and unheeding now,
    With downcast eyes and knitting brow,
    And folded arms, and freezing air,
    And lips that scarce their scorn forbear,
    Her knights, her dames, her court--is there:
    And he--the chosen one, whose lance
    Had yet been couched before her glance,
    Who--were his arm a moment free--
    Had died or gained her liberty;                                     170
    The minion of his father's bride,--
    He, too, is fettered by her side;
    Nor sees her swoln and full eye swim
    Less for her own despair than him:
    Those lids--o'er which the violet vein
    Wandering, leaves a tender stain,
    Shining through the smoothest white
    That e'er did softest kiss invite--
    Now seemed with hot and livid glow
    To press, not shade, the orbs below;                                180
    Which glance so heavily, and fill,
    As tear on tear grows gathering still[rb][418]

                    XI.

    And he for her had also wept,
      But for the eyes that on him gazed:
    His sorrow, if he felt it, slept;
      Stern and erect his brow was raised.
    Whate'er the grief his soul avowed,
    He would not shrink before the crowd;
    But yet he dared not look on her;
    Remembrance of the hours that were--                                190
    His guilt--his love--his present state--
    His father's wrath, all good men's hate--
    His earthly, his eternal fate--
    And hers,--oh, hers! he dared not throw
    One look upon that death-like brow!
    Else had his rising heart betrayed
    Remorse for all the wreck it made.

                    XII.

    And Azo spake:--"But yesterday
      I gloried in a wife and son;
    That dream this morning passed away;                                200
      Ere day declines, I shall have none.
    My life must linger on alone;
    Well,--let that pass,--there breathes not one
    Who would not do as I have done:
    Those ties are broken--not by me;
      Let that too pass;--the doom's prepared!
    Hugo, the priest awaits on thee,
      And then--thy crime's reward!
    Away! address thy prayers to Heaven.
      Before its evening stars are met,                                 210
    Learn if thou there canst be forgiven:
      Its mercy may absolve thee yet.
    But here, upon the earth beneath,
      There is no spot where thou and I
    Together for an hour could breathe:
      Farewell! I will not see thee die--
    But thou, frail thing! shall view his head--
      Away! I cannot speak the rest:
      Go! woman of the wanton breast;
    Not I, but thou his blood dost shed:                                220
    Go! if that sight thou canst outlive,
    And joy thee in the life I give."

                    XIII.

    And here stern Azo hid his face--
      For on his brow the swelling vein
      Throbbed as if back upon his brain
      The hot blood ebbed and flowed again;
    And therefore bowed he for a space,
      And passed his shaking hand along
      His eye, to veil it from the throng;
    While Hugo raised his chained hands,                                230
    And for a brief delay demands
    His father's ear: the silent sire
    Forbids not what his words require.
      "It is not that I dread the death--
    For thou hast seen me by thy side
    All redly through the battle ride,
    And that--not once a useless brand--
    Thy slaves have wrested from my hand
    Hath shed more blood in cause of thine,
    Than e'er can stain the axe of mine:[419]                           240
      Thou gav'st, and may'st resume my breath,
    A gift for which I thank thee not;
    Nor are my mother's wrongs forgot,
    Her slighted love and ruined name,
    Her offspring's heritage of shame;
    But she is in the grave, where he,
    Her son--thy rival--soon shall be.
    Her broken heart--my severed head--
    Shall witness for thee from the dead
    How trusty and how tender were                                      250
    Thy youthful love--paternal care.
    'Tis true that I have done thee wrong--
      But wrong for wrong:--this,--deemed thy bride,
      The other victim of thy pride,--
    Thou know'st for me was destined long;
    Thou saw'st, and coveted'st her charms;
      And with thy very crime--my birth,--
      Thou taunted'st me--as little worth;
    A match ignoble for her arms;
    Because, forsooth, I could not claim                                260
    The lawful heirship of thy name,
    Nor sit on Este's lineal throne;
      Yet, were a few short summers mine,
      My name should more than Este's shine
    With honours all my own.
    I had a sword--and have a breast
    That should have won as haught[420] a crest
    As ever waved along the line
    Of all these sovereign sires of thine.
    Not always knightly spurs are worn                                  270
    The brightest by the better born;
    And mine have lanced my courser's flank
    Before proud chiefs of princely rank,
    When charging to the cheering cry
    Of 'Este and of Victory!'
    I will not plead the cause of crime,
    Nor sue thee to redeem from time
    A few brief hours or days that must
    At length roll o'er my reckless dust;--
    Such maddening moments as my past,                                  280
    They could not, and they did not, last;--
    Albeit my birth and name be base,
    And thy nobility of race
    Disdained to deck a thing like me--
      Yet in my lineaments they trace
      Some features of my father's face,
    And in my spirit--all of thee.
    From thee this tamelessness of heart--
    From thee--nay, wherefore dost thou start?---
    From thee in all their vigour came                                  290
    My arm of strength, my soul of flame--
    Thou didst not give me life alone,
    But all that made me more thine own.
    See what thy guilty love hath done!
    Repaid thee with too like a son!
    I am no bastard in my soul,
    For that, like thine, abhorred control;
    And for my breath, that hasty boon
    Thou gav'st and wilt resume so soon,
    I valued it no more than thou,                                      300
    When rose thy casque above thy brow,
    And we, all side by side, have striven,
    And o'er the dead our coursers driven:
    The past is nothing--and at last
    The future can but be the past;[421]
    Yet would I that I then had died:
      For though thou work'dst my mother's ill,
    And made thy own my destined bride,
      I feel thou art my father still:
    And harsh as sounds thy hard decree,                                310
    'Tis not unjust, although from thee.
    Begot in sin, to die in shame,
    My life begun and ends the same:
    As erred the sire, so erred the son,
    And thou must punish both in one.
    My crime seems worst to human view,
    But God must judge between us too!"[422]

                    XIV.

    He ceased--and stood with folded arms,
      On which the circling fetters sounded;
      And not an ear but felt as wounded,                               320
      Of all the chiefs that there were ranked,
      When those dull chains in meeting clanked:
    Till Parisina's fatal charms[423]
    Again attracted every eye--
    Would she thus hear him doomed to die!
    She stood, I said, all pale and still,
    The living cause of Hugo's ill:
    Her eyes unmoved, but full and wide,
    Not once had turned to either side--
    Nor once did those sweet eyelids close,                             330
    Or shade the glance o'er which they rose,
    But round their orbs of deepest blue
    The circling white dilated grew--
    And there with glassy gaze she stood
    As ice were in her curdled blood;
    But every now and then a tear[424]
      So large and slowly gathered slid
      From the long dark fringe of that fair lid,
    It was a thing to see, not hear![425]
    And those who saw, it did surprise,                                 340
    Such drops could fall from human eyes.
    To speak she thought--the imperfect note
    Was choked within her swelling throat,
    Yet seemed in that low hollow groan
    Her whole heart gushing in the tone.
    It ceased--again she thought to speak,
    Then burst her voice in one long shriek,
    And to the earth she fell like stone
    Or statue from its base o'erthrown,
    More like a thing that ne'er had life,--                            350
    A monument of Azo's wife,--
    Than her, that living guilty thing,
    Whose every passion was a sting,
    Which urged to guilt, but could not bear
    That guilt's detection and despair.
    But yet she lived--and all too soon
    Recovered from that death-like swoon--
    But scarce to reason--every sense
    Had been o'erstrung by pangs intense;
    And each frail fibre of her brain                                   360
    (As bowstrings, when relaxed by rain,
    The erring arrow launch aside)
    Sent forth her thoughts all wild and wide--
    The past a blank, the future black,
    With glimpses of a dreary track,
    Like lightning on the desert path,
    When midnight storms are mustering wrath.
    She feared--she felt that something ill
    Lay on her soul, so deep and chill;
    That there was sin and shame she knew,                              370
    That some one was to die--but who?
    She had forgotten:--did she breathe?
    Could this be still the earth beneath,
    The sky above, and men around;
    Or were they fiends who now so frowned
    On one, before whose eyes each eye
    Till then had smiled in sympathy?
    All was confused and undefined
    To her all-jarred and wandering mind;
    A chaos of wild hopes and fears:                                    380
    And now in laughter, now in tears,
    But madly still in each extreme,
    She strove with that convulsive dream;
    For so it seemed on her to break:
    Oh! vainly must she strive to wake!

                    XV.

    The Convent bells are ringing,
      But mournfully and slow;
    In the grey square turret swinging,
      With a deep sound, to and fro.
      Heavily to the heart they go!                                     390
    Hark! the hymn is singing--
      The song for the dead below,
      Or the living who shortly shall be so!
    For a departed being's soul[rc]
    The death-hymn peals and the hollow bells knoll:[426]
    He is near his mortal goal;
    Kneeling at the Friar's knee,
    Sad to hear, and piteous to see--
    Kneeling on the bare cold ground.
    With the block before and the guards around;                        400
    And the headsman with his bare arm ready,
    That the blow may be both swift and steady,
    Feels if the axe be sharp and true
    Since he set its edge anew:[427]
    While the crowd in a speechless circle gather
    To see the Son fall by the doom of the Father!

                    XVI.

    It is a lovely hour as yet
    Before the summer sun shall set,
    Which rose upon that heavy day,
    And mock'd it with his steadiest ray;                               410
    And his evening beams are shed
    Full on Hugo's fated head,
    As his last confession pouring
    To the monk, his doom deploring
    In penitential holiness,
    He bends to hear his accents bless
    With absolution such as may
    Wipe our mortal stains away.
    That high sun on his head did glisten
    As he there did bow and listen,                                     420
    And the rings of chestnut hair
    Curled half down his neck so bare;
    But brighter still the beam was thrown
    Upon the axe which near him shone
    With a clear and ghastly glitter----
    Oh! that parting hour was bitter!
    Even the stern stood chilled with awe:
    Dark the crime, and just the law--
    Yet they shuddered as they saw.

                    XVII.

    The parting prayers are said and over                               430
    Of that false son, and daring lover!
    His beads and sins are all recounted,[rd]
    His hours to their last minute mounted;
    His mantling cloak before was stripped,
    His bright brown locks must now be clipped;
    'Tis done--all closely are they shorn;
    The vest which till this moment worn--
    The scarf which Parisina gave--
    Must not adorn him to the grave.
    Even that must now be thrown aside,                                 440
    And o'er his eyes the kerchief tied;
    But no--that last indignity
    Shall ne'er approach his haughty eye.
    All feelings seemingly subdued,
    In deep disdain were half renewed,
    When headsman's hands prepared to bind
    Those eyes which would not brook such blind,
    As if they dared not look on death.
    "No--yours my forfeit blood and breath;
    These hands are chained, but let me die                             450
    At least with an unshackled eye--
    Strike:"--and as the word he said,
    Upon the block he bowed his head;
    These the last accents Hugo spoke:
    "Strike"--and flashing fell the stroke--
    Rolled the head--and, gushing, sunk
    Back the stained and heaving trunk,
    In the dust, which each deep vein
    Slaked with its ensanguined rain;
    His eyes and lips a moment quiver,                                  460
    Convulsed and quick--then fix for ever.

    He died, as erring man should die,
      Without display, without parade;
      Meekly had he bowed and prayed,
      As not disdaining priestly aid,
    Nor desperate of all hope on high.
    And while before the Prior kneeling,
    His heart was weaned from earthly feeling;
    His wrathful Sire--his Paramour--
    What were they in such an hour?                                     470
    No more reproach,--no more despair,--
    No thought but Heaven,--no word but prayer--
    Save the few which from him broke,
    When, bared to meet the headsman's stroke,
    He claimed to die with eyes unbound,
    His sole adieu to those around.

                    XVIII.

    Still as the lips that closed in death,
    Each gazer's bosom held his breath:
    But yet, afar, from man to man,
    A cold electric[428] shiver ran,                                    480
    As down the deadly blow descended
    On him whose life and love thus ended;
    And, with a hushing sound compressed,
    A sigh shrunk back on every breast;
    But no more thrilling noise rose there,[re]
      Beyond the blow that to the block
      Pierced through with forced and sullen shock,
    Save one:--what cleaves the silent air
    So madly shrill, so passing wild?
    That, as a mother's o'er her child,                                 490
    Done to death by sudden blow,
    To the sky these accents go,
    Like a soul's in endless woe.
    Through Azo's palace-lattice driven,
    That horrid voice ascends to heaven,
    And every eye is turned thereon;
    But sound and sight alike are gone!
    It was a woman's shriek--and ne'er
    In madlier accents rose despair;
    And those who heard it, as it past,                                 500
    In mercy wished it were the last.

                    XIX.

    Hugo is fallen; and, from that hour,
    No more in palace, hall, or bower,
    Was Parisina heard or seen:
    Her name--as if she ne'er had been--
    Was banished from each lip and ear,
    Like words of wantonness or fear;
    And from Prince Azo's voice, by none
    Was mention heard of wife or son;
    No tomb--no memory had they;                                        510
    Theirs was unconsecrated clay--
    At least the Knight's who died that day.
    But Parisina's fate lies hid
    Like dust beneath the coffin lid:
    Whether in convent she abode,
    And won to heaven her dreary road,
    By blighted and remorseful years
    Of scourge, and fast, and sleepless tears;
    Or if she fell by bowl or steel,
    For that dark love she dared to feel:                               520
    Or if, upon the moment smote,
    She died by tortures less remote,
    Like him she saw upon the block
    With heart that shared the headsman's shock,
    In quickened brokenness that came,
    In pity o'er her shattered frame,
    None knew--and none can ever know:
    But whatsoe'er its end below,
    Her life began and closed in woe!

                    XX.

    And Azo found another bride,                                        530
    And goodly sons grew by his side;
    But none so lovely and so brave
    As him who withered in the grave;[429]
    Or if they were--on his cold eye
    Their growth but glanced unheeded by,
    Or noticed with a smothered sigh.
    But never tear his cheek descended,
    And never smile his brow unbended;
    And o'er that fair broad brow were wrought
    The intersected lines of thought;                                   540
    Those furrows which the burning share
    Of Sorrow ploughs untimely there;
    Scars of the lacerating mind
    Which the Soul's war doth leave behind.[430]
    He was past all mirth or woe:
    Nothing more remained below
    But sleepless nights and heavy days,
    A mind all dead to scorn or praise,
    A heart which shunned itself--and yet
    That would not yield, nor could forget,                             550
    Which, when it least appeared to melt,
    Intensely thought--intensely felt:
    The deepest ice which ever froze
    Can only o'er the surface close;
    The living stream lies quick below,
    And flows, and cannot cease to flow.[431]
    Still was his sealed-up bosom haunted[rf]
    By thoughts which Nature hath implanted;
    Too deeply rooted thence to vanish,
    Howe'er our stifled tears we banish;                                560
    When struggling as they rise to start,
    We check those waters of the heart,
    They are not dried--those tears unshed
    But flow back to the fountain head,
    And resting in their spring more pure,
    For ever in its depth endure,
    Unseen--unwept--but uncongealed,
    And cherished most where least revealed.
    With inward starts of feeling left,
    To throb o'er those of life bereft,                                 570
    Without the power to fill again
    The desert gap which made his pain;
    Without the hope to meet them where
    United souls shall gladness share;
    With all the consciousness that he
    Had only passed a just decree;[rg]
    That they had wrought their doom of ill;
    Yet Azo's age was wretched still.
    The tainted branches of the tree,
      If lopped with care, a strength may give,                         580
      By which the rest shall bloom and live
    All greenly fresh and wildly free:
    But if the lightning, in its wrath,
    The waving boughs with fury scathe,
    The massy trunk the ruin feels,
    And never more a leaf reveals.





                         POEMS OF THE SEPARATION



                    FARE THEE WELL.[432]

           "Alas! they had been friends in youth;
           But whispering tongues can poison truth:
           And Constancy lives in realms above;
           And Life is thorny; and youth is vain:
           And to be wroth with one we love,
           Doth work like madness in the brain;

                  *       *       *       *       *

           But never either found another
           To free the hollow heart from paining--
           They stood aloof, the scars remaining,
           Like cliffs which had been rent asunder;
           A dreary sea now flows between,
           But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder,
           Shall wholly do away, I ween,
           The marks of that which once hath been."
                                      Coleridge's Christabel.[rh]

    Fare thee well! and if for ever,
      Still for ever, fare _thee well:_
    Even though unforgiving, never
      'Gainst thee shall my heart rebel.
    Would that breast were bared before thee[ri]
      Where thy head so oft hath lain,
    While that placid sleep came o'er thee[rj]
      Which thou ne'er canst know again:
    Would that breast, by thee glanced over,
      Every inmost thought could show!
    Then thou would'st at last discover
      'Twas not well to spurn it so.
    Though the world for this commend thee--[433]
      Though it smile upon the blow,
    Even its praises must offend thee,
      Founded on another's woe:
    Though my many faults defaced me,
      Could no other arm be found,
    Than the one which once embraced me,
      To inflict a cureless wound?
    Yet, oh yet, thyself deceive not--
      Love may sink by slow decay,
    But by sudden wrench, believe not
      Hearts can thus be torn away:
    Still thine own its life retaineth--
      Still must mine, though bleeding, beat;[rk]
    And the undying thought which paineth[rl]
      Is--that we no more may meet.
    These are words of deeper sorrow[rm]
      Than the wail above the dead;
    Both shall live--but every morrow[rn]
      Wake us from a widowed bed.
    And when thou would'st solace gather--
      When our child's first accents flow--
    Wilt thou teach her to say "Father!"
      Though his care she must forego?
    When her little hands shall press thee--
      When her lip to thine is pressed--
    Think of him whose prayer shall bless thee--
      Think of him thy love _had_ blessed!
    Should her lineaments resemble
      Those thou never more may'st see,
    Then thy heart will softly tremble[ro]
      With a pulse yet true to me.
    All my faults perchance thou knowest--
      All my madness--none can know;[rp]
    All my hopes--where'er thou goest--
      Wither--yet with _thee_ they go.
    Every feeling hath been shaken;
      Pride--which not a world could bow--[rq]
    Bows to thee--by thee forsaken,[rr]
      Even my soul forsakes me now.
    But 'tis done--all words are idle--
      Words from me are vainer still;[rs]
    But the thoughts we cannot bridle
      Force their way without the will.
    Fare thee well! thus disunited--[rt]
      Torn from every nearer tie--
    Seared in heart--and lone--and blighted--
      More than this I scarce can die.

                     A SKETCH.[ru][434]

             "Honest--honest Iago!
              If that thou be'st a devil, I cannot kill thee."
                                                 Shakespeare.

    Born in the garret, in the kitchen bred,
    Promoted thence to deck her mistress' head;[rv]
    Next--for some gracious service unexpressed,
    And from its wages only to be guessed--
    Raised from the toilet to the table,--where
    Her wondering betters wait behind her chair.
    With eye unmoved, and forehead unabashed,
    She dines from off the plate she lately washed.
    Quick with the tale, and ready with the lie,
    The genial confidante, and general spy--                             10
    Who could, ye gods! her next employment guess--
    An only infant's earliest governess![rw]
    She taught the child to read, and taught so well,
    That she herself, by teaching, learned to spell.
    An adept next in penmanship she grows,
    As many a nameless slander deftly shows:
    What she had made the pupil of her art,
    None know--but that high Soul secured the heart,[rx]
    And panted for the truth it could not hear,
    With longing breast and undeluded ear.                               20
    Foiled was perversion by that youthful mind,[ry]
    Which Flattery fooled not, Baseness could not blind,
    Deceit infect not, near Contagion soil,
    Indulgence weaken, nor Example spoil,[rz]
    Nor mastered Science tempt her to look down
    On humbler talents with a pitying frown,
    Nor Genius swell, nor Beauty render vain,
    Nor Envy ruffle to retaliate pain,[sa]
    Nor Fortune change, Pride raise, nor Passion bow,
    Nor Virtue teach austerity--till now.                                30
    Serenely purest of her sex that live,[sb]
    But wanting one sweet weakness--to forgive;
    Too shocked at faults her soul can never know,
    She deems that all could be like her below:
    Foe to all vice, yet hardly Virtue's friend,
    For Virtue pardons those she would amend.

    But to the theme, now laid aside too long,
    The baleful burthen of this honest song,[sc]
    Though all her former functions are no more,
    She rules the circle which she served before.                        40
    If mothers--none know why--before her quake;
    If daughters dread her for the mothers' sake;
    If early habits--those false links, which bind
    At times the loftiest to the meanest mind--[sd]
    Have given her power too deeply to instil
    The angry essence of her deadly will;[se]
    If like a snake she steal within your walls,
    Till the black slime betray her as she crawls;
    If like a viper to the heart she wind,
    And leave the venom there she did not find;                          50
    What marvel that this hag of hatred works[sf]
    Eternal evil latent as she lurks,
    To make a Pandemonium where she dwells,
    And reign the Hecate of domestic hells?
    Skilled by a touch to deepen Scandal's tints
    With all the kind mendacity of hints,
    While mingling truth with falsehood--sneers with smiles--
    A thread of candour with a web of wiles;[sg]
    A plain blunt show of briefly-spoken seeming,
    To hide her bloodless heart's soul-hardened scheming;                60
    A lip of lies; a face formed to conceal,
    And, without feeling, mock at all who feel:
    With a vile mask the Gorgon would disown,--
    A cheek of parchment, and an eye of stone.[sh]
    Mark, how the channels of her yellow blood
    Ooze to her skin, and stagnate there to mud,
    Cased like the centipede in saffron mail,
    Or darker greenness of the scorpion's scale--[si]
    (For drawn from reptiles only may we trace
    Congenial colours in that soul or face)--                            70
    Look on her features! and behold her mind[sj]
    As in a mirror of itself defined:
    Look on the picture! deem it not o'ercharged--
    There is no trait which might not be enlarged:
    Yet true to "Nature's journeymen,"[435] who made
    This monster when their mistress left off trade--
    This female dog-star of her little sky,
    Where all beneath her influence droop or die.[sk]

    Oh! wretch without a tear--without a thought,
    Save joy above the ruin thou hast wrought--                          80
    The time shall come, nor long remote, when thou
    Shalt feel far more than thou inflictest now;
    Feel for thy vile self-loving self in vain,
    And turn thee howling in unpitied pain.
    May the strong curse of crushed affections light[436]
    Back on thy bosom with reflected blight!
    And make thee in thy leprosy of mind
    As loathsome to thyself as to mankind!
    Till all thy self-thoughts curdle into hate,
    Black--as thy will or others would create:                           90
    Till thy hard heart be calcined into dust,
    And thy soul welter in its hideous crust.
    Oh, may thy grave be sleepless as the bed,
    The widowed couch of fire, that thou hast spread!
    Then, when thou fain wouldst weary Heaven with prayer,
    Look on thine earthly victims--and despair!
    Down to the dust!--and, as thou rott'st away,
    Even worms shall perish on thy poisonous clay.[sl]
    But for the love I bore, and still must bear,
    To her thy malice from all ties would tear--                        100
    Thy name--thy human name--to every eye
    The climax of all scorn should hang on high,
    Exalted o'er thy less abhorred compeers--
    And festering[437] in the infamy of years.[sm]

                  STANZAS TO AUGUSTA.[438]

    When all around grew drear and dark,[sn]
      And reason half withheld her ray--
    And Hope but shed a dying spark
      Which more misled my lonely way;
    In that deep midnight of the mind,
      And that internal strife of heart,
    When dreading to be deemed too kind,
      The weak despair--the cold depart;
    When Fortune changed--and Love fled far,[so]
      And Hatred's shafts flew thick and fast,
    Thou wert the solitary star[sp]
      Which rose and set not to the last.[sq]
    Oh! blest be thine unbroken light!
      That watched me as a Seraph's eye,
    And stood between me and the night,
      For ever shining sweetly nigh.
    And when the cloud upon us came,[sr]
      Which strove to blacken o'er thy ray--[ss]
    Then purer spread its gentle flame,[st]
      And dashed the darkness all away.
    Still may thy Spirit dwell on mine,[su]
      And teach it what to brave or brook--
    There's more in one soft word of thine
      Than in the world's defied rebuke.
    Thou stood'st, as stands a lovely tree,[sv]
      That still unbroke, though gently bent,
    Still waves with fond fidelity
      Its boughs above a monument.
    The winds might rend--the skies might pour,
      But there thou wert--and still wouldst be
    Devoted in the stormiest hour
      To shed thy weeping leaves o'er me.
    But thou and thine shall know no blight,
      Whatever fate on me may fall;
    For Heaven in sunshine will requite
      The kind--and thee the most of all.
    Then let the ties of baffled love
      Be broken--thine will never break;
    Thy heart can feel--but will not move;
      Thy soul, though soft, will never shake.
    And these, when all was lost beside,
      Were found and still are fixed in thee:--
    And bearing still a breast so tried,
      Earth is no desert--ev'n to me.

                         THE PRISONER OF CHILLON

                        I.

    My hair is grey, but not with years,
    Nor grew it white
        In a single night,[3]
    As men's have grown from sudden fears:
    My limbs are bowed, though not with toil,
      But rusted with a vile repose,[b]
    For they have been a dungeon's spoil,
      And mine has been the fate of those
    To whom the goodly earth and air
    Are banned,[4] and barred--forbidden fare;                         10
    But this was for my father's faith
    I suffered chains and courted death;
    That father perished at the stake
    For tenets he would not forsake;
    And for the same his lineal race
    In darkness found a dwelling place;
    We were seven--who now are one,[5]
      Six in youth, and one in age,
    Finished as they had begun,
      Proud of Persecution's rage;[c]                                  20
    One in fire, and two in field,
    Their belief with blood have sealed,
    Dying as their father died,
    For the God their foes denied;--
    Three were in a dungeon cast,
    Of whom this wreck is left the last.

                        II.

    There are seven pillars of Gothic mould,[6]
    In Chillon's dungeons deep and old,
    There are seven columns, massy and grey,
    Dim with a dull imprisoned ray,                                    30
    A sunbeam which hath lost its way,
    And through the crevice and the cleft
    Of the thick wall is fallen and left;
    Creeping o'er the floor so damp,
    Like a marsh's meteor lamp:[7]
    And in each pillar there is a ring,[8]
      And in each ring there is a chain;
    That iron is a cankering thing,
      For in these limbs its teeth remain,
    With marks that will not wear away,                                40
    Till I have done with this new day,
    Which now is painful to these eyes,
    Which have not seen the sun so rise
    For years--I cannot count them o'er,
    I lost their long and heavy score
    When my last brother drooped and died,
    And I lay living by his side.

                        III.

    They chained us each to a column stone,
    And we were three--yet, each alone;
    We could not move a single pace,                                   50
    We could not see each other's face,
    But with that pale and livid light
    That made us strangers in our sight:
    And thus together--yet apart,
    Fettered in hand, but joined in heart,[d]
    'Twas still some solace in the dearth
    Of the pure elements of earth,
    To hearken to each other's speech,
    And each turn comforter to each
    With some new hope, or legend old,                                 60
    Or song heroically bold;
    But even these at length grew cold.
    Our voices took a dreary tone,
    An echo of the dungeon stone,
        A grating sound, not full and free,
        As they of yore were wont to be:
        It might be fancy--but to me
    They never sounded like our own.

                        IV.

    I was the eldest of the three,
      And to uphold and cheer the rest                                 70
      I ought to do--and did my best--
    And each did well in his degree.
      The youngest, whom my father loved,
    Because our mother's brow was given
    To him, with eyes as blue as heaven--
      For him my soul was sorely moved:
    And truly might it be distressed
    To see such bird in such a nest;[9]
    For he was beautiful as day--
      (When day was beautiful to me                                    80
      As to young eagles, being free)--
      A polar day, which will not see[10]
    A sunset till its summer's gone,
      Its sleepless summer of long light,
    The snow-clad offspring of the sun:
      And thus he was as pure and bright,
    And in his natural spirit gay,
    With tears for nought but others' ills,
    And then they flowed like mountain rills,
    Unless he could assuage the woe                                    90
    Which he abhorred to view below.

                        V.

    The other was as pure of mind,
    But formed to combat with his kind;
    Strong in his frame, and of a mood
    Which 'gainst the world in war had stood,
    And perished in the foremost rank
      With joy:--but not in chains to pine:
    His spirit withered with their clank,
      I saw it silently decline--
      And so perchance in sooth did mine:                             100
    But yet I forced it on to cheer
    Those relics of a home so dear.
    He was a hunter of the hills,
      Had followed there the deer and wolf;
      To him this dungeon was a gulf,
    And fettered feet the worst of ills.

                        VI.

      Lake Leman lies by Chillon's walls:
    A thousand feet in depth below
    Its massy waters meet and flow;
    Thus much the fathom-line was sent                                 110
    From Chillon's snow-white battlement,[11]
      Which round about the wave inthralls:
    A double dungeon wall and wave
    Have made--and like a living grave.
    Below the surface of the lake[12]
    The dark vault lies wherein we lay:
    We heard it ripple night and day;
      Sounding o'er our heads it knocked;
    And I have felt the winter's spray
    Wash through the bars when winds were high                         120
    And wanton in the happy sky;
      And then the very rock hath rocked,
      And I have felt it shake, unshocked,[13]
    Because I could have smiled to see
    The death that would have set me free.

                        VII.

    I said my nearer brother pined,
    I said his mighty heart declined,
    He loathed and put away his food;
    It was not that 'twas coarse and rude,
    For we were used to hunter's fare,                                 130
    And for the like had little care:
    The milk drawn from the mountain goat
    Was changed for water from the moat,
    Our bread was such as captives' tears
    Have moistened many a thousand years,
    Since man first pent his fellow men
    Like brutes within an iron den;
    But what were these to us or him?
    These wasted not his heart or limb;
    My brother's soul was of that mould                                140
    Which in a palace had grown cold,
    Had his free breathing been denied
    The range of the steep mountain's side;[14]
    But why delay the truth?--he died.[e]
    I saw, and could not hold his head,
    Nor reach his dying hand--nor dead,--
    Though hard I strove, but strove in vain,
    To rend and gnash my bonds in twain.[f]
    He died--and they unlocked his chain,
    And scooped for him a shallow grave[15]                            150
    Even from the cold earth of our cave.
    I begged them, as a boon, to lay
    His corse in dust whereon the day
    Might shine--it was a foolish thought,
    But then within my brain it wrought,[16]
    That even in death his freeborn breast
    In such a dungeon could not rest.
    I might have spared my idle prayer--
    They coldly laughed--and laid him there:
    The flat and turfless earth above                                  160
    The being we so much did love;
    His empty chain above it leant,
    Such Murder's fitting monument!

                        VIII.

    But he, the favourite and the flower,
    Most cherished since his natal hour,
    His mother's image in fair face,
    The infant love of all his race,
    His martyred father's dearest thought,[17]
    My latest care, for whom I sought
    To hoard my life, that his might be                                170
    Less wretched now, and one day free;
    He, too, who yet had held untired
    A spirit natural or inspired--
    He, too, was struck, and day by day
    Was withered on the stalk away.[18]
    Oh, God! it is a fearful thing
    To see the human soul take wing
    In any shape, in any mood:[19]
    I've seen it rushing forth in blood,
    I've seen it on the breaking ocean                                 180
    Strive with a swoln convulsive motion,
    I've seen the sick and ghastly bed
    Of Sin delirious with its dread:
    But these were horrors--this was woe
    Unmixed with such--but sure and slow:
    He faded, and so calm and meek,
    So softly worn, so sweetly weak,
    So tearless, yet so tender--kind,
    And grieved for those he left behind;
    With all the while a cheek whose bloom                             190
    Was as a mockery of the tomb,
    Whose tints as gently sunk away
    As a departing rainbow's ray;
    An eye of most transparent light,
    That almost made the dungeon bright;
    And not a word of murmur--not
    A groan o'er his untimely lot,--
    A little talk of better days,
    A little hope my own to raise,
    For I was sunk in silence--lost                                    200
    In this last loss, of all the most;
    And then the sighs he would suppress
    Of fainting Nature's feebleness,
    More slowly drawn, grew less and less:
    I listened, but I could not hear;
    I called, for I was wild with fear;
    I knew 'twas hopeless, but my dread
    Would not be thus admonished;
    I called, and thought I heard a sound--
    I burst my chain with one strong bound,                            210
    And rushed to him:--I found him not,
    _I_ only stirred in this black spot,
    _I_ only lived, _I_ only drew
    The accursed breath of dungeon-dew;
    The last, the sole, the dearest link
    Between me and the eternal brink,
    Which bound me to my failing race,
    Was broken in this fatal place.
    One on the earth, and one beneath--
    My brothers--both had ceased to breathe:                           220
    I took that hand which lay so still,
    Alas! my own was full as chill;
    I had not strength to stir, or strive,
    But felt that I was still alive--
    A frantic feeling, when we know
    That what we love shall ne'er be so.
        I know not why
        I could not die,[20]
    I had no earthly hope--but faith,
    And that forbade a selfish death.                                  230

                        IX.

    What next befell me then and there
      I know not well--I never knew--
    First came the loss of light, and air,
      And then of darkness too:
    I had no thought, no feeling--none--
    Among the stones I stood a stone,[21]
    And was, scarce conscious what I wist,
    As shrubless crags within the mist;
    For all was blank, and bleak, and grey;
    It was not night--it was not day;                                  240
    It was not even the dungeon-light,
    So hateful to my heavy sight,
    But vacancy absorbing space,
    And fixedness--without a place;
    There were no stars--no earth--no time--
    No check--no change--no good--no crime--
    But silence, and a stirless breath
    Which neither was of life nor death;
    A sea of stagnant idleness,
    Blind, boundless, mute, and motionless!                            250

                        X.

    A light broke in upon my brain,--
      It was the carol of a bird;
    It ceased, and then it came again,
      The sweetest song ear ever heard,
    And mine was thankful till my eyes
    Ran over with the glad surprise,
    And they that moment could not see
    I was the mate of misery;
    But then by dull degrees came back
    My senses to their wonted track;                                   260
    I saw the dungeon walls and floor
    Close slowly round me as before,
    I saw the glimmer of the sun
    Creeping as it before had done,
    But through the crevice where it came
    That bird was perched, as fond and tame,
      And tamer than upon the tree;
    A lovely bird, with azure wings,[22]
    And song that said a thousand things,
      And seemed to say them all for me!                               270
    I never saw its like before,
    I ne'er shall see its likeness more:
    It seemed like me to want a mate,
    But was not half so desolate,[23]
    And it was come to love me when
    None lived to love me so again,
    And cheering from my dungeon's brink,
    Had brought me back to feel and think.
    I know not if it late were free,
      Or broke its cage to perch on mine,                              280
    But knowing well captivity,
      Sweet bird! I could not wish for thine!
    Or if it were, in winged guise,
    A visitant from Paradise;
    For--Heaven forgive that thought! the while
    Which made me both to weep and smile--
    I sometimes deemed that it might be
    My brother's soul come down to me;[24]
    But then at last away it flew,
    And then 'twas mortal well I knew,                                 290
    For he would never thus have flown--
    And left me twice so doubly lone,--
    Lone--as the corse within its shroud,
    Lone--as a solitary cloud,[25]
      A single cloud on a sunny day,
    While all the rest of heaven is clear,
    A frown upon the atmosphere,
    That hath no business to appear[26]
      When skies are blue, and earth is gay.

                        XI.

    A kind of change came in my fate,                                  300
    My keepers grew compassionate;
    I know not what had made them so,
    They were inured to sights of woe,
    But so it was:--my broken chain
    With links unfastened did remain,
    And it was liberty to stride
    Along my cell from side to side,
    And up and down, and then athwart,
    And tread it over every part;
    And round the pillars one by one,                                  310
    Returning where my walk begun,
    Avoiding only, as I trod,
    My brothers' graves without a sod;
    For if I thought with heedless tread
    My step profaned their lowly bed,
    My breath came gaspingly and thick,
    And my crushed heart felt blind and sick.

                        XII.

    I made a footing in the wall,
      It was not therefrom to escape,
    For I had buried one and all,                                      320
      Who loved me in a human shape;
    And the whole earth would henceforth be
    A wider prison unto me:[27]
    No child--no sire--no kin had I,
    No partner in my misery;
    I thought of this, and I was glad,
    For thought of them had made me mad;
    But I was curious to ascend
    To my barred windows, and to bend
    Once more, upon the mountains high,                                330
    The quiet of a loving eye.[28]

                        XIII.

    I saw them--and they were the same,
    They were not changed like me in frame;
    I saw their thousand years of snow
    On high--their wide long lake below,[g]
    And the blue Rhone in fullest flow;[29]
    I heard the torrents leap and gush
    O'er channelled rock and broken bush;
    I saw the white-walled distant town,[30]
    And whiter sails go skimming down;                                 340
    And then there was a little isle,[31]
    Which in my very face did smile,
      The only one in view;
    A small green isle, it seemed no more,[32]
    Scarce broader than my dungeon floor,
    But in it there were three tall trees,
    And o'er it blew the mountain breeze,
    And by it there were waters flowing,
    And on it there were young flowers growing,
      Of gentle breath and hue.                                        350
    The fish swam by the castle wall,
    And they seemed joyous each and all;[33]
    The eagle rode the rising blast,
    Methought he never flew so fast
    As then to me he seemed to fly;
    And then new tears came in my eye,
    And I felt troubled--and would fain
    I had not left my recent chain;
    And when I did descend again,
    The darkness of my dim abode                                       360
    Fell on me as a heavy load;
    It was as is a new-dug grave,
    Closing o'er one we sought to save,--
    And yet my glance, too much opprest,
    Had almost need of such a rest.

                        XIV.

    It might be months, or years, or days--
      I kept no count, I took no note--
    I had no hope my eyes to raise,
      And clear them of their dreary mote;
    At last men came to set me free;                                   370
      I asked not why, and recked not where;
    It was at length the same to me,
    Fettered or fetterless to be,
      I learned to love despair.
    And thus when they appeared at last,
    And all my bonds aside were cast,
    These heavy walls to me had grown
    A hermitage--and all my own![34]
    And half I felt as they were come
    To tear me from a second home:                                     380
    With spiders I had friendship made,
    And watched them in their sullen trade,
    Had seen the mice by moonlight play,
    And why should I feel less than they?
    We were all inmates of one place,
    And I, the monarch of each race,
    Had power to kill--yet, strange to tell!
    In quiet we had learned to dwell;[h]
    My very chains and I grew friends,
    So much a long communion tends                                     390
    To make us what we are:--even I
    Regained my freedom with a sigh.






                                THE DREAM

                        I.

    Our life is twofold: Sleep hath its own world,
    A boundary between the things misnamed
    Death and existence: Sleep hath its own world,
    And a wide realm of wild reality,
    And dreams in their developement have breath,
    And tears, and tortures, and the touch of Joy;
    They leave a weight upon our waking thoughts,
    They take a weight from off our waking toils,
    They do divide our being;[35] they become
    A portion of ourselves as of our time,                              10
    And look like heralds of Eternity;
    They pass like spirits of the past,--they speak
    Like Sibyls of the future; they have power--
    The tyranny of pleasure and of pain;
    They make us what we were not--what they will,
    And shake us with the vision that's gone by,[36]
    The dread of vanished shadows--Are they so?
    Is not the past all shadow?--What are they?
    Creations of the mind?--The mind can make
    Substance, and people planets of its own                            20
    With beings brighter than have been, and give
    A breath to forms which can outlive all flesh.[37]
    I would recall a vision which I dreamed
    Perchance in sleep--for in itself a thought,
    A slumbering thought, is capable of years,
    And curdles a long life into one hour.[38]

                        II.

    I saw two beings in the hues of youth
    Standing upon a hill, a gentle hill,
    Green and of mild declivity, the last
    As 'twere the cape of a long ridge of such,                         30
    Save that there was no sea to lave its base,
    But a most living landscape, and the wave
    Of woods and cornfields, and the abodes of men
    Scattered at intervals, and wreathing smoke
    Arising from such rustic roofs;--the hill
    Was crowned with a peculiar diadem
    Of trees, in circular array, so fixed,
    Not by the sport of nature, but of man:
    These two, a maiden and a youth, were there
    Gazing--the one on all that was beneath                             40
    Fair as herself--but the Boy gazed on her;
    And both were young, and one was beautiful:
    And both were young--yet not alike in youth.
    As the sweet moon on the horizon's verge,
    The Maid was on the eve of Womanhood;
    The Boy had fewer summers, but his heart
    Had far outgrown his years, and to his eye
    There was but one beloved face on earth,
    And that was shining on him: he had looked
    Upon it till it could not pass away;                                50
    He had no breath, no being, but in hers;
    She was his voice; he did not speak to her,
    But trembled on her words; she was his sight,[i][39]
    For his eye followed hers, and saw with hers,
    Which coloured all his objects:--he had ceased
    To live within himself; she was his life,
    The ocean to the river of his thoughts,[40]
    Which terminated all: upon a tone,
    A touch of hers, his blood would ebb and flow,[41]
    And his cheek change tempestuously--his heart                       60
    Unknowing of its cause of agony.
    But she in these fond feelings had no share:
    Her sighs were not for him; to her he was
    Even as a brother--but no more; 'twas much,
    For brotherless she was, save in the name
    Her infant friendship had bestowed on him;
    Herself the solitary scion left
    Of a time-honoured race.[42]--It was a name
    Which pleased him, and yet pleased him not--and why?
    Time taught him a deep answer--when she loved                       70
    Another: even _now_ she loved another,
    And on the summit of that hill she stood
    Looking afar if yet her lover's steed[43]
    Kept pace with her expectancy, and flew.

                        III.

    A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
    There was an ancient mansion, and before
    Its walls there was a steed caparisoned:
    Within an antique Oratory stood
    The Boy of whom I spake;--he was alone,[44]
    And pale, and pacing to and fro: anon                               80
    He sate him down, and seized a pen, and traced
    Words which I could not guess of; then he leaned
    His bowed head on his hands, and shook as 'twere
    With a convulsion--then arose again,
    And with his teeth and quivering hands did tear
    What he had written, but he shed no tears.
    And he did calm himself, and fix his brow
    Into a kind of quiet: as he paused,
    The Lady of his love re-entered there;
    She was serene and smiling then, and yet                            90
    She knew she was by him beloved--she knew,
    For quickly comes such knowledge,[45] that his heart
    Was darkened with her shadow, and she saw
    That he was wretched, but she saw not all.
    He rose, and with a cold and gentle grasp
    He took her hand; a moment o'er his face
    A tablet of unutterable thoughts
    Was traced, and then it faded, as it came;
    He dropped the hand he held, and with slow steps
    Retired, but not as bidding her adieu,                             100
    For they did part with mutual smiles; he passed
    From out the massy gate of that old Hall,
    And mounting on his steed he went his way;
    And ne'er repassed that hoary threshold more.[46]

                        IV.

    A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
    The Boy was sprung to manhood: in the wilds
    Of fiery climes he made himself a home,
    And his Soul drank their sunbeams: he was girt
    With strange and dusky aspects; he was not
    Himself like what he had been; on the sea                          110
    And on the shore he was a wanderer;
    There was a mass of many images
    Crowded like waves upon me, but he was
    A part of all; and in the last he lay
    Reposing from the noontide sultriness,
    Couched among fallen columns, in the shade
    Of ruined walls that had survived the names
    Of those who reared them; by his sleeping side
    Stood camels grazing, and some goodly steeds
    Were fastened near a fountain; and a man                           120
    Clad in a flowing garb did watch the while,
    While many of his tribe slumbered around:
    And they were canopied by the blue sky,
    So cloudless, clear, and purely beautiful,
    That God alone was to be seen in Heaven.[47]

                        V.

    A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
    The Lady of his love was wed with One
    Who did not love her better:--in her home,
    A thousand leagues from his,--her native home,
    She dwelt, begirt with growing Infancy,                            130
    Daughters and sons of Beauty,--but behold!
    Upon her face there was the tint of grief,
    The settled shadow of an inward strife,
    And an unquiet drooping of the eye,
    As if its lid were charged with unshed tears.[48]
    What could her grief be?--she had all she loved,
    And he who had so loved her was not there
    To trouble with bad hopes, or evil wish,
    Or ill-repressed affliction, her pure thoughts.
    What could her grief be?--she had loved him not,                   140
    Nor given him cause to deem himself beloved,
    Nor could he be a part of that which preyed
    Upon her mind--a spectre of the past.

                        VI.

    A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
    The Wanderer was returned.--I saw him stand
    Before an Altar--with a gentle bride;
    Her face was fair, but was not that which made
    The Starlight[49] of his Boyhood;--as he stood
    Even at the altar, o'er his brow there came
    The self-same aspect, and the quivering shock[50]                  150
    That in the antique Oratory shook
    His bosom in its solitude; and then--
    As in that hour--a moment o'er his face
    The tablet of unutterable thoughts
    Was traced,--and then it faded as it came,
    And he stood calm and quiet, and he spoke
    The fitting vows, but heard not his own words,
    And all things reeled around him; he could see
    Not that which was, nor that which should have been--
    But the old mansion, and the accustomed hall,                      160
    And the remembered chambers, and the place,
    The day, the hour, the sunshine, and the shade,
    All things pertaining to that place and hour
    And her who was his destiny, came back
    And thrust themselves between him and the light:
    What business had they there at such a time?

                        VII.

    A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
    The Lady of his love;--Oh! she was changed
    As by the sickness of the soul; her mind
    Had wandered from its dwelling, and her eyes                       170
    They had not their own lustre, but the look
    Which is not of the earth; she was become
    The Queen of a fantastic realm; her thoughts
    Were combinations of disjointed things;
    And forms, impalpable and unperceived
    Of others' sight, familiar were to hers.
    And this the world calls frenzy; but the wise
    Have a far deeper madness--and the glance
    Of melancholy is a fearful gift;
    What is it but the telescope of truth?                             180
    Which strips the distance of its fantasies,
    And brings life near in utter nakedness,
    Making the cold reality too real![j][51]

                        VIII.

    A change came o'er the spirit of my dream.
    The Wanderer was alone as heretofore,
    The beings which surrounded him were gone,
    Or were at war with him; he was a mark
    For blight and desolation, compassed round
    With Hatred and Contention; Pain was mixed
    In all which was served up to him, until,                          190
    Like to the Pontic monarch of old days,[52]
    He fed on poisons, and they had no power,
    But were a kind of nutriment; he lived
    Through that which had been death to many men,
    And made him friends of mountains:[53] with the stars
    And the quick Spirit of the Universe[54]
    He held his dialogues; and they did teach
    To him the magic of their mysteries;
    To him the book of Night was opened wide,
    And voices from the deep abyss revealed[55]                        200
    A marvel and a secret--Be it so.

                        IX.

    My dream was past; it had no further change.
    It was of a strange order, that the doom
    Of these two creatures should be thus traced out
    Almost like a reality--the one
    To end in madness--both in misery.

                             DARKNESS.[k][56]

    I had a dream, which was not all a dream.
    The bright sun was extinguished, and the stars
    Did wander darkling in the eternal space,
    Rayless, and pathless, and the icy Earth
    Swung blind and blackening in the moonless air;
    Morn came and went--and came, and brought no day,
    And men forgot their passions in the dread
    Of this their desolation; and all hearts
    Were chilled into a selfish prayer for light:
    And they did live by watchfires--and the thrones,                   10
    The palaces of crowned kings--the huts,
    The habitations of all things which dwell,
    Were burnt for beacons; cities were consumed,
    And men were gathered round their blazing homes
    To look once more into each other's face;
    Happy were those who dwelt within the eye
    Of the volcanos, and their mountain-torch:
    A fearful hope was all the World contained;
    Forests were set on fire--but hour by hour
    They fell and faded--and the crackling trunks                       20
    Extinguished with a crash--and all was black.
    The brows of men by the despairing light
    Wore an unearthly aspect, as by fits
    The flashes fell upon them; some lay down
    And hid their eyes and wept; and some did rest
    Their chins upon their clenched hands, and smiled;
    And others hurried to and fro, and fed
    Their funeral piles with fuel, and looked up
    With mad disquietude on the dull sky,
    The pall of a past World; and then again                            30
    With curses cast them down upon the dust,
    And gnashed their teeth and howled: the wild birds shrieked,
    And, terrified, did flutter on the ground,
    And flap their useless wings; the wildest brutes
    Came tame and tremulous; and vipers crawled
    And twined themselves among the multitude,
    Hissing, but stingless--they were slain for food:
    And War, which for a moment was no more,
    Did glut himself again:--a meal was bought
    With blood, and each sate sullenly apart                            40
    Gorging himself in gloom: no Love was left;
    All earth was but one thought--and that was Death,
    Immediate and inglorious; and the pang
    Of famine fed upon all entrails--men
    Died, and their bones were tombless as their flesh;
    The meagre by the meagre were devoured,
    Even dogs assailed their masters, all save one,
    And he was faithful to a corse, and kept
    The birds and beasts and famished men at bay,
    Till hunger clung them,[57] or the dropping dead                    50
    Lured their lank jaws; himself sought out no food,
    But with a piteous and perpetual moan,
    And a quick desolate cry, licking the hand
    Which answered not with a caress--he died.
    The crowd was famished by degrees; but two
    Of an enormous city did survive,
    And they were enemies: they met beside
    The dying embers of an altar-place
    Where had been heaped a mass of holy things
    For an unholy usage; they raked up,                                 60
    And shivering scraped with their cold skeleton hands
    The feeble ashes, and their feeble breath
    Blew for a little life, and made a flame
    Which was a mockery; then they lifted up
    Their eyes as it grew lighter, and beheld[58]
    Each other's aspects--saw, and shrieked, and died--
    Even of their mutual hideousness they died,
    Unknowing who he was upon whose brow
    Famine had written Fiend. The World was void,
    The populous and the powerful was a lump,                           70
    Seasonless, herbless, treeless, manless, lifeless--
    A lump of death--a chaos of hard clay.
    The rivers, lakes, and ocean all stood still,
    And nothing stirred within their silent depths;
    Ships sailorless lay rotting on the sea,
    And their masts fell down piecemeal: as they dropped
    They slept on the abyss without a surge--
    The waves were dead; the tides were in their grave,
    The Moon, their mistress, had expired before;
    The winds were withered in the stagnant air,                        80
    And the clouds perished; Darkness had no need
    Of aid from them--She was the Universe.

                          CHURCHILL'S GRAVE,[59]

                      A FACT LITERALLY RENDERED.[60]

    I stood beside the grave of him who blazed
    The Comet of a season, and I saw
    The humblest of all sepulchres, and gazed
      With not the less of sorrow and of awe
    On that neglected turf and quiet stone,
    With name no clearer than the names unknown,
    Which lay unread around it; and I asked
      The Gardener of that ground, why it might be
    That for this plant strangers his memory tasked,
      Through the thick deaths of half a century;                       10
    And thus he answered--"Well, I do not know
    Why frequent travellers turn to pilgrims so;
    He died before my day of Sextonship,
      And I had not the digging of this grave."
    And is this all? I thought,--and do we rip
      The veil of Immortality, and crave
    I know not what of honour and of light
    Through unborn ages, to endure this blight?
    So soon, and so successless? As I said,[61]
    The Architect of all on which we tread,                             20
    For Earth is but a tombstone, did essay
    To extricate remembrance from the clay,
    Whose minglings might confuse a Newton's thought,
      Were it not that all life must end in one,
    Of which we are but dreamers;--as he caught
      As 'twere the twilight of a former Sun,[62]
    Thus spoke he,--"I believe the man of whom
    You wot, who lies in this selected[63] tomb,
    Was a most famous writer in his day,
    And therefore travellers step from out their way                    30
    To pay him honour,--and myself whate'er
      Your honour pleases:"--then most pleased I shook[l]
      From out my pocket's avaricious nook
    Some certain coins of silver, which as 'twere
    Perforce I gave this man, though I could spare
    So much but inconveniently:--Ye smile,
    I see ye, ye profane ones! all the while,
    Because my homely phrase the truth would tell.
    You are the fools, not I--for I did dwell
    With a deep thought, and with a softened eye,                       40
    On that old Sexton's natural homily,
    In which there was Obscurity and Fame,--
    The Glory and the Nothing of a Name.

                             PROMETHEUS.[64]

                        I.

    Titan! to whose immortal eyes
      The sufferings of mortality,
      Seen in their sad reality,
    Were not as things that gods despise;
    What was thy pity's recompense?[65]
    A silent suffering, and intense;
    The rock, the vulture, and the chain,
    All that the proud can feel of pain,
    The agony they do not show,
    The suffocating sense of woe,                                       10
      Which speaks but in its loneliness,
    And then is jealous lest the sky
    Should have a listener, nor will sigh
      Until its voice is echoless.

                        II.

    Titan! to thee the strife was given
      Between the suffering and the will,
      Which torture where they cannot kill;
    And the inexorable Heaven,[66]
    And the deaf tyranny of Fate,
    The ruling principle of Hate,                                      20
    Which for its pleasure doth create[67]
    The things it may annihilate,
    Refused thee even the boon to die:[68]
    The wretched gift Eternity
    Was thine--and thou hast borne it well.
    All that the Thunderer wrung from thee
    Was but the menace which flung back
    On him the torments of thy rack;
    The fate thou didst so well foresee,[69]
    But would not to appease him tell;                                 30
    And in thy Silence was his Sentence,
    And in his Soul a vain repentance,
    And evil dread so ill dissembled,
    That in his hand the lightnings trembled.

                        III.

    Thy Godlike crime was to be kind,[70]
      To render with thy precepts less
      The sum of human wretchedness,
    And strengthen Man with his own mind;
    But baffled as thou wert from high,
    Still in thy patient energy,                                        40
    In the endurance, and repulse
      Of thine impenetrable Spirit,
    Which Earth and Heaven could not convulse,
      A mighty lesson we inherit:
    Thou art a symbol and a sign
      To Mortals of their fate and force;
    Like thee, Man is in part divine,[71]
    A troubled stream from a pure source;
    And Man in portions can foresee
    His own funereal destiny;                                           50
    His wretchedness, and his resistance,
    And his sad unallied existence:
    To which his Spirit may oppose
    Itself--an equal to all woes--[m][72]
    And a firm will, and a deep sense,
    Which even in torture can descry
      Its own concentered recompense,
    Triumphant where it dares defy,
    And making Death a Victory.

                             A FRAGMENT.[73]

    Could I remount the river of my years
    To the first fountain of our smiles and tears,
    I would not trace again the stream of hours
    Between their outworn banks of withered flowers,
    But bid it flow as now--until it glides
    Into the number of the nameless tides.

       *       *       *       *       *

    What is this Death?--a quiet of the heart?
    The whole of that of which we are a part?
    For Life is but a vision--what I see
    Of all which lives alone is Life to me,                             10
    And being so--the absent are the dead,
    Who haunt us from tranquillity, and spread
    A dreary shroud around us, and invest
    With sad remembrancers our hours of rest.
      The absent are the dead--for they are cold,
    And ne'er can be what once we did behold;
    And they are changed, and cheerless,--or if yet
    The unforgotten do not all forget,
    Since thus divided--equal must it be
    If the deep barrier be of earth, or sea;                            20
    It may be both--but one day end it must
    In the dark union of insensate dust.
      The under-earth inhabitants--are they
    But mingled millions decomposed to clay?
    The ashes of a thousand ages spread
    Wherever Man has trodden or shall tread?
    Or do they in their silent cities dwell
    Each in his incommunicative cell?
    Or have they their own language? and a sense
    Of breathless being?--darkened and intense                          30
    As Midnight in her solitude?--Oh Earth!
    Where are the past?--and wherefore had they birth?
    The dead are thy inheritors--and we
    But bubbles on thy surface; and the key
    Of thy profundity is in the Grave,
    The ebon portal of thy peopled cave,
    Where I would walk in spirit, and behold[74]
    Our elements resolved to things untold,
    And fathom hidden wonders, and explore
    The essence of great bosoms now no more.                            40

                          SONNET TO LAKE LEMAN.

    Rousseau--Voltaire--our Gibbon--and De Stael--
      Leman![75] these names are worthy of thy shore,
      Thy shore of names like these! wert thou no more,
    Their memory thy remembrance would recall:
    To them thy banks were lovely as to all,
      But they have made them lovelier, for the lore
      Of mighty minds doth hallow in the core
    Of human hearts the ruin of a wall
      Where dwelt the wise and wondrous; but by _thee_
    How much more, Lake of Beauty! do we feel,
      In sweetly gliding o'er thy crystal sea,[76]
    The wild glow of that not ungentle zeal,
      Which of the Heirs of Immortality
    Is proud, and makes the breath of Glory real!

                        STANZAS TO AUGUSTA.[n][77]

                        I.

    Though the day of my Destiny's over,
      And the star of my Fate hath declined,[o]
    Thy soft heart refused to discover
      The faults which so many could find;
    Though thy Soul with my grief was acquainted,
      It shrunk not to share it with me,
    And the Love which my Spirit hath painted[p]
      It never hath found but in _Thee_.

                        II.

    Then when Nature around me is smiling,[78]
      The last smile which answers to mine,
    I do not believe it beguiling,[q]
      Because it reminds me of thine;
    And when winds are at war with the ocean,
      As the breasts I believed in with me,[r]
    If their billows excite an emotion,
      It is that they bear me from _Thee._

                        III.

    Though the rock of my last Hope is shivered,[s]
      And its fragments are sunk in the wave,
    Though I feel that my soul is delivered
      To Pain--it shall not be its slave.
    There is many a pang to pursue me:
      They may crush, but they shall not contemn;
    They may torture, but shall not subdue me;
      'Tis of _Thee_ that I think--not of them.[t]

                        IV.

    Though human, thou didst not deceive me,
      Though woman, thou didst not forsake,
    Though loved, thou forborest to grieve me,
      Though slandered, thou never couldst shake;[u][79]
    Though trusted, thou didst not disclaim me,
      Though parted, it was not to fly,
    Though watchful, 'twas not to defame me,
      Nor, mute, that the world might belie.[v]

                        V.

    Yet I blame not the World, nor despise it,
      Nor the war of the many with one;
    If my Soul was not fitted to prize it,
      'Twas folly not sooner to shun:[80]
    And if dearly that error hath cost me,
      And more than I once could foresee,
    I have found that, whatever it lost me,[w]
      It could not deprive me of _Thee_.


                        VI.

    From the wreck of the past, which hath perished,[x]
      Thus much I at least may recall,
    It hath taught me that what I most cherished
      Deserved to be dearest of all:
    In the Desert a fountain is springing,[y][81]
      In the wide waste there still is a tree,
    And a bird in the solitude singing,
      Which speaks to my spirit of _Thee_.[82]

                                                          _July_ 24, 1816.

                     [First published, _Prisoner of Chillon_, etc., 1816.]





                         EPISTLE TO AUGUSTA.[83]

                        I.

      My Sister! my sweet Sister! if a name
      Dearer and purer were, it should be thine.
      Mountains and seas divide us, but I claim
      No tears, but tenderness to answer mine:
      Go where I will, to me thou art the same--
      A loved regret which I would not resign.[z]
      There yet are two things in my destiny,--
    A world to roam through, and a home with thee.[84]

                        II.

      The first were nothing--had I still the last,
      It were the haven of my happiness;
      But other claims and other ties thou hast,[aa]
      And mine is not the wish to make them less.
      A strange doom is thy father's son's, and past[ab]
      Recalling, as it lies beyond redress;
      Reversed for him our grandsire's[85] fate of yore,--
    He had no rest at sea, nor I on shore.

                        III.

      If my inheritance of storms hath been
      In other elements, and on the rocks
      Of perils, overlooked or unforeseen,
      I have sustained my share of worldly shocks,
      The fault was mine; nor do I seek to screen
      My errors with defensive paradox;[ac]
      I have been cunning in mine overthrow,
    The careful pilot of my proper woe.

                        IV.

      Mine were my faults, and mine be their reward.
      My whole life was a contest, since the day
      That gave me being, gave me that which marred
      The gift,--a fate, or will, that walked astray;[86]
      And I at times have found the struggle hard,
      And thought of shaking off my bonds of clay:
      But now I fain would for a time survive,
    If but to see what next can well arrive.

                        V.

      Kingdoms and Empires in my little day
      I have outlived, and yet I am not old;
      And when I look on this, the petty spray
      Of my own years of trouble, which have rolled
      Like a wild bay of breakers, melts away:
      Something--I know not what--does still uphold
      A spirit of slight patience;--not in vain,
    Even for its own sake, do we purchase Pain.

                        VI.

      Perhaps the workings of defiance stir
      Within me--or, perhaps, a cold despair
      Brought on when ills habitually recur,--
      Perhaps a kinder clime, or purer air,
      (For even to this may change of soul refer,[ad]
      And with light armour we may learn to bear,)
      Have taught me a strange quiet, which was not
    The chief companion of a calmer lot.[ae]

                        VII.

      I feel almost at times as I have felt
      In happy childhood; trees, and flowers, and brooks,
      Which do remember me of where I dwelt,
      Ere my young mind was sacrificed to books,[af]
      Come as of yore upon me, and can melt
      My heart with recognition of their looks;
      And even at moments I could think I see
    Some living thing to love--but none like thee.[ag]

                        VIII.

      Here are the Alpine landscapes which create
      A fund for contemplation;--to admire
      Is a brief feeling of a trivial date;
      But something worthier do such scenes inspire:
      Here to be lonely is not desolate,[87]
      For much I view which I could most desire,
      And, above all, a Lake I can behold
    Lovelier, not dearer, than our own of old.[88]

                        IX.

      Oh that thou wert but with me!--but I grow
      The fool of my own wishes, and forget
      The solitude which I have vaunted so
      Has lost its praise in this but one regret;
      There may be others which I less may show;--
      I am not of the plaintive mood, and yet
      I feel an ebb in my philosophy,
    And the tide rising in my altered eye.[ah]

                        X.

      I did remind thee of our own dear Lake,
      By the old Hall which may be mine no more.
      _Leman's_ is fair; but think not I forsake
      The sweet remembrance of a dearer shore:
      Sad havoc Time must with my memory make,
      Ere that or thou can fade these eyes before;
      Though, like all things which I have loved, they are
    Resigned for ever, or divided far.

                        XI.

      The world is all before me; I but ask
      Of Nature that with which she will comply--
      It is but in her Summer's sun to bask,
      To mingle with the quiet of her sky,
      To see her gentle face without a mask,
      And never gaze on it with apathy.
      She was my early friend, and now shall be
    My sister--till I look again on thee.

                        XII.

      I can reduce all feelings but this one;
      And that I would not;--for at length I see
      Such scenes as those wherein my life begun--[89]
      The earliest--even the only paths for me--[ai]
      Had I but sooner learnt the crowd to shun,
      I had been better than I now can be;
      The Passions which have torn me would have slept;
    _I_ had not suffered, and _thou_ hadst not wept.

                        XIII.

      With false Ambition what had I to do?
      Little with Love, and least of all with Fame;
      And yet they came unsought, and with me grew,
      And made me all which they can make--a Name.
      Yet this was not the end I did pursue;
      Surely I once beheld a nobler aim.
      But all is over--I am one the more
    To baffled millions which have gone before.

                        XIV.

      And for the future, this world's future may[aj]
      From me demand but little of my care;
      I have outlived myself by many a day;[ak]
      Having survived so many things that were;
      My years have been no slumber, but the prey
      Of ceaseless vigils; for I had the share
      Of life which might have filled a century,[90]
    Before its fourth in time had passed me by.

                        XV.

      And for the remnant which may be to come[al]
      I am content; and for the past I feel
      Not thankless,--for within the crowded sum
      Of struggles, Happiness at times would steal,
      And for the present, I would not benumb
      My feelings farther.--Nor shall I conceal
      That with all this I still can look around,
    And worship Nature with a thought profound.

                        XVI.

      For thee, my own sweet sister, in thy heart
      I know myself secure, as thou in mine;
      We were and are--I am, even as thou art--[am]
      Beings who ne'er each other can resign;
      It is the same, together or apart,
      From Life's commencement to its slow decline
      We are entwined--let Death come slow or fast,[an]
    The tie which bound the first endures the last!

               [First published, _Letters and Journals,_ 1830, ii. 38-41.]





              LINES ON HEARING THAT LADY BYRON WAS ILL.[91]

    And thou wert sad--yet I was not with thee;
      And thou wert sick, and yet I was not near;
    Methought that Joy and Health alone could be
      Where I was _not_--and pain and sorrow here!
    And is it thus?--it is as I foretold,
      And shall be more so; for the mind recoils
    Upon itself, and the wrecked heart lies cold,
      While Heaviness collects the shattered spoils.
    It is not in the storm nor in the strife
      We feel benumbed, and wish to be no more,
      But in the after-silence on the shore,
    When all is lost, except a little life.

    I am too well avenged!--but 'twas my right;
      Whate'er my sins might be, _thou_ wert not sent
    To be the Nemesis who should requite--[92]
      Nor did Heaven choose so near an instrument.
    Mercy is for the merciful!--if thou
    Hast been of such, 'twill be accorded now.
    Thy nights are banished from the realms of sleep:--[93]
      Yes! they may flatter thee, but thou shall feel
      A hollow agony which will not heal,
    For thou art pillowed on a curse too deep;
    Thou hast sown in my sorrow, and must reap
      The bitter harvest in a woe as real!
    I have had many foes, but none like thee;
      For 'gainst the rest myself I could defend,
      And be avenged, or turn them into friend;
    But thou in safe implacability
    Hadst nought to dread--in thy own weakness shielded,
    And in my love, which hath but too much yielded,
      And spared, for thy sake, some I should not spare;
    And thus upon the world--trust in thy truth,
    And the wild fame of my ungoverned youth--
      On things that were not, and on things that are--
    Even upon such a basis hast thou built
    A monument, whose cement hath been guilt!
      The moral Clytemnestra of thy lord,[94]
      And hewed down, with an unsuspected sword,
    Fame, peace, and hope--and all the better life
      Which, but for this cold treason of thy heart,
    Might still have risen from out the grave of strife,
      And found a nobler duty than to part.
    But of thy virtues didst thou make a vice,
      Trafficking with them in a purpose cold,
      For present anger, and for future gold--
    And buying others' grief at any price.[95]
    And thus once entered into crooked ways,
    The early truth, which was thy proper praise,[96]
    Did not still walk beside thee--but at times,
    And with a breast unknowing its own crimes,
    Deceit, averments incompatible,
    Equivocations, and the thoughts which dwell
      In Janus-spirits--the significant eye
    Which learns to lie with silence--the pretext[97]
    Of prudence, with advantages annexed--
    The acquiescence in all things which tend,
    No matter how, to the desired end--
      All found a place in thy philosophy.
    The means were worthy, and the end is won--
    I would not do by thee as thou hast done!

                            MONODY ON THE DEATH

                             DRAMATIS PERSONAE.


                                Manfred.
                                Chamois Hunter.
                                Abbot of St. Maurice.
                                Manuel.

                                Witch of the Alps.
                                Arimanes.
                                Nemesis.
                                The Destinies.
                                Spirits, etc.

    _The Scene of the Drama is amongst the Higher Alps--partly in the
             Castle of Manfred, and partly in the Mountains._




                              MANFRED.[106]


                                  ACT 1.

      SCENE 1.--Manfred _alone_.--_Scene, a Gothic Gallery._[107]--
                            _Time, Midnight._

    _Man_. The lamp must be replenished, but even then
    It will not burn so long as I must watch:
    My slumbers--if I slumber--are not sleep,
    But a continuance, of enduring thought,
    Which then I can resist not: in my heart
    There is a vigil, and these eyes but close
    To look within; and yet I live, and bear
    The aspect and the form of breathing men.
    But Grief should be the Instructor of the wise;
    Sorrow is Knowledge: they who know the most                         10
    Must mourn the deepest o'er the fatal truth,
    The Tree of Knowledge is not that of Life.
    Philosophy and science, and the springs[108]
    Of Wonder, and the wisdom of the World,
    I have essayed, and in my mind there is
    A power to make these subject to itself--
    But they avail not: I have done men good,
    And I have met with good even among men--
    But this availed not: I have had my foes,
    And none have baffled, many fallen before me--                      20
    But this availed not:--Good--or evil--life--
    Powers, passions--all I see in other beings,
    Have been to me as rain unto the sands,
    Since that all-nameless hour. I have no dread,
    And feel the curse to have no natural fear,
    Nor fluttering throb, that beats with hopes or wishes,
    Or lurking love of something on the earth.
    Now to my task.--
                     Mysterious Agency!
    Ye Spirits of the unbounded Universe![ap]
    Whom I have sought in darkness and in light--                       30
    Ye, who do compass earth about, and dwell
    In subtler essence--ye, to whom the tops
    Of mountains inaccessible are haunts,[aq]
    And Earth's and Ocean's caves familiar things--
    I call upon ye by the written charm[109]
    Which gives me power upon you--Rise! Appear!
                                                                 [A pause.
    They come not yet.--Now by the voice of him
    Who is the first among you[110]--by this sign,
    Which makes you tremble--by the claims of him
    Who is undying,--Rise! Appear!----Appear!                           40
                                                                 [A pause.
    If it be so.--Spirits of Earth and Air,
    Ye shall not so elude me! By a power,
    Deeper than all yet urged, a tyrant-spell,
    Which had its birthplace in a star condemned,
    The burning wreck of a demolished world,
    A wandering hell in the eternal Space;
    By the strong curse which is upon my Soul,[111]
    The thought which is within me and around me,
    I do compel ye to my will.--Appear!

         [_A star is seen at the darker end of the gallery: it is
               stationary; and a voice is heard singing._]

                              First Spirit.

      Mortal! to thy bidding bowed,                                     50
      From my mansion in the cloud,
      Which the breath of Twilight builds,
      And the Summer's sunset gilds
      With the azure and vermilion,
      Which is mixed for my pavilion;[ar]
      Though thy quest may be forbidden,
      On a star-beam I have ridden,
      To thine adjuration bowed:
      Mortal--be thy wish avowed!

                      _Voice of the_ Second Spirit.

    Mont Blanc is the Monarch of mountains;                             60
      They crowned him long ago
    On a throne of rocks, in a robe of clouds,
      With a Diadem of snow.
    Around his waist are forests braced,
      The Avalanche in his hand;
    But ere it fall, that thundering ball
      Must pause for my command.
    The Glacier's cold and restless mass
      Moves onward day by day;
    But I am he who bids it pass,                                       70
      Or with its ice delay.[as]
    I am the Spirit of the place,
      Could make the mountain bow
    And quiver to his caverned base--
      And what with me would'st _Thou?_

                       _Voice of the_ Third Spirit.

    In the blue depth of the waters,
      Where the wave hath no strife,
    Where the Wind is a stranger,
      And the Sea-snake hath life,
    Where the Mermaid is decking                                        80
      Her green hair with shells,
    Like the storm on the surface
      Came the sound of thy spells;
    O'er my calm Hall of Coral
      The deep Echo rolled--
    To the Spirit of Ocean
      Thy wishes unfold!

                              FOURTH SPIRIT.

    Where the slumbering Earthquake
      Lies pillowed on fire,
    And the lakes of bitumen                                            90
      Rise boilingly higher;
    Where the roots of the Andes
      Strike deep in the earth,
    As their summits to heaven
      Shoot soaringly forth;
    I have quitted my birthplace,
      Thy bidding to bide--
    Thy spell hath subdued me,
      Thy will be my guide!

                              FIFTH SPIRIT.

    I am the Rider of the wind,                                        100
      The Stirrer of the storm;
    The hurricane I left behind
      Is yet with lightning warm;
    To speed to thee, o'er shore and sea
      I swept upon the blast:
    The fleet I met sailed well--and yet
      'Twill sink ere night be past.

                              SIXTH SPIRIT.

    My dwelling is the shadow of the Night,
    Why doth thy magic torture me with light?

                             SEVENTH SPIRIT.

    The Star which rules thy destiny no                                110
    Was ruled, ere earth began, by me:
    It was a World as fresh and fair
    As e'er revolved round Sun in air;
    Its course was free and regular,
    Space bosomed not a lovelier star.
    The Hour arrived--and it became
    A wandering mass of shapeless flame,
    A pathless Comet, and a curse,
    The menace of the Universe;
    Still rolling on with innate force,                                120
    Without a sphere, without a course,
    A bright deformity on high,
    The monster of the upper sky!
    And Thou! beneath its influence born--
    Thou worm! whom I obey and scorn--
    Forced by a Power (which is not thine,
    And lent thee but to make thee mine)
    For this brief moment to descend,
    Where these weak Spirits round thee bend
    And parley with a thing like thee--                                130
    What would'st thou, Child of Clay! with me?[112]

                           _The_ SEVEN SPIRITS.

    Earth--ocean--air--night--mountains--winds--thy Star,
      Are at thy beck and bidding, Child of Clay!
    Before thee at thy quest their Spirits are--
      What would'st thou with us, Son of mortals--say?

    _Man_. Forgetfulness----

    _First Spirit_.            Of what--of whom--and why?

    _Man_. Of that which is within me; read it there--
    Ye know it--and I cannot utter it.

    _Spirit_. We can but give thee that which we possess:
    Ask of us subjects, sovereignty, the power                         140
    O'er earth--the whole, or portion--or a sign
    Which shall control the elements, whereof
    We are the dominators,--each and all,
    These shall be thine.

    _Man_.                Oblivion--self-oblivion!
    Can ye not wring from out the hidden realms
    Ye offer so profusely--what I ask?

    _Spirit_. It is not in our essence, in our skill;
    But--thou may'st die.

    _Man_.                Will Death bestow it on me?

    _Spirit_. We are immortal, and do not forget;
    We are eternal; and to us the past                                 150
    Is, as the future, present. Art thou answered?

    _Man_. Ye mock me--but the Power which brought ye here
    Hath made you mine. Slaves, scoff not at my will!
    The Mind--the Spirit--the Promethean spark,[at]
    The lightning of my being, is as bright,
    Pervading, and far darting as your own,
    And shall not yield to yours, though cooped in clay!
    Answer, or I will teach you what I am.[au]

    _Spirit_. We answer--as we answered; our reply
    Is even in thine own words.

    _Man_.                      Why say ye so?                         160

    _Spirit_. If, as thou say'st, thine essence be as ours,
    We have replied in telling thee, the thing
    Mortals call death hath nought to do with us.

    _Man_. I then have called ye from your realms in vain;
    Ye cannot, or ye will not, aid me.

    _Spirit_.                         Say--[113]
    What we possess we offer; it is thine:
    Bethink ere thou dismiss us; ask again;
    Kingdom, and sway, and strength, and length of days--

    _Man_. Accursed! what have I to do with days?
    They are too long already.--Hence--begone!                         170

    _Spirit_. Yet pause: being here, our will would do thee service;
    Bethink thee, is there then no other gift
    Which we can make not worthless in thine eyes?

    _Man._ No, none: yet stay--one moment, ere we part,
    I would behold ye face to face. I hear
    Your voices, sweet and melancholy sounds,
    As Music on the waters;[114] and I see
    The steady aspect of a clear large Star;
    But nothing more. Approach me as ye are,
    Or one--or all--in your accustomed forms.                          180

    _Spirit_. We have no forms, beyond the elements
    Of which we are the mind and principle:
    But choose a form--in that we will appear.

    _Man_. I have no choice; there is no form on earth
    Hideous or beautiful to me. Let him,
    Who is most powerful of ye, take such aspect
    As unto him may seem most fitting--Come!

    _Seventh Spirit (appearing in the shape of a beautiful
    female figure)_.[115] Behold!

    _Man_.        Oh God! if it be thus, and _thou_[116]
    Art not a madness and a mockery,
    I yet might be most happy. I will clasp thee,                      190
    And we again will be----
                                                   [_The figure vanishes._
                            My heart is crushed!
                                               [MANFRED _falls senseless_.

       (_A voice is heard in the Incantation which follows._)[117]

        When the Moon is on the wave,
          And the glow-worm in the grass,
        And the meteor on the grave,
          And the wisp on the morass;[118]
        When the falling stars are shooting,
        And the answered owls are hooting,
        And the silent leaves are still
        In the shadow of the hill,
        Shall my soul be upon thine,                                   200
        With a power and with a sign.

        Though thy slumber may be deep,
        Yet thy Spirit shall not sleep;
        There are shades which will not vanish,
        There are thoughts thou canst not banish;
        By a Power to thee unknown,
        Thou canst never be alone;
        Thou art wrapt as with a shroud,
        Thou art gathered in a cloud;
        And for ever shalt thou dwell                                  210
        In the spirit of this spell.

        Though thou seest me not pass by,
        Thou shalt feel me with thine eye
        As a thing that, though unseen,
        Must be near thee, and hath been;
        And when in that secret dread
        Thou hast turned around thy head,
        Thou shalt marvel I am not
        As thy shadow on the spot,
        And the power which thou dost feel                             220
        Shall be what thou must conceal.

        And a magic voice and verse
        Hath baptized thee with a curse;
        And a Spirit of the air
        Hath begirt thee with a snare;
        In the wind there is a voice
        Shall forbid thee to rejoice;
        And to thee shall Night deny
        All the quiet of her sky;
        And the day shall have a sun,                                  230
        Which shall make thee wish it done.

        From thy false tears I did distil
        An essence which hath strength to kill;
        From thy own heart I then did wring
        The black blood in its blackest spring;
        From thy own smile I snatched the snake,
        For there it coiled as in a brake;
        From thy own lip I drew the charm
        Which gave all these their chiefest harm;
        In proving every poison known,                                 240
        I found the strongest was thine own.

        By the cold breast and serpent smile,
        By thy unfathomed gulfs of guile,
        By that most seeming virtuous eye,
        By thy shut soul's hypocrisy;
        By the perfection of thine art
        Which passed for human thine own heart;
        By thy delight in others' pain,
        And by thy brotherhood of Cain,
        I call upon thee! and compel[av]                               250
        Thyself to be thy proper Hell!

        And on thy head I pour the vial
        Which doth devote thee to this trial;
        Nor to slumber, nor to die,
        Shall be in thy destiny;
        Though thy death shall still seem near
        To thy wish, but as a fear;
        Lo! the spell now works around thee,
        And the clankless chain hath bound thee;
        O'er thy heart and brain together                              260
        Hath the word been passed--now wither!

               SCENE II.--_The Mountain of the Jungfrau_.--
            _Time, Morning_.--MANFRED _alone upon the cliffs._

    _Man_. The spirits I have raised abandon me,
    The spells which I have studied baffle me,
    The remedy I recked of tortured me
    I lean no more on superhuman aid;
    It hath no power upon the past, and for
    The future, till the past be gulfed in darkness,
    It is not of my search.--My Mother Earth![119]
    And thou fresh-breaking Day, and you, ye Mountains,
    Why are ye beautiful? I cannot love ye.
    And thou, the bright Eye of the Universe,                           10
    That openest over all, and unto all
    Art a delight--thou shin'st not on my heart.
    And you, ye crags, upon whose extreme edge
    I stand, and on the torrent's brink beneath
    Behold the tall pines dwindled as to shrubs
    In dizziness of distance; when a leap,
    A stir, a motion, even a breath, would bring
    My breast upon its rocky bosom's bed
    To rest for ever--wherefore do I pause?
    I feel the impulse--yet I do not plunge;                            20
    I see the peril--yet do not recede;
    And my brain reels--and yet my foot is firm:
    There is a power upon me which withholds,
    And makes it my fatality to live,--
    If it be life to wear within myself
    This barrenness of Spirit, and to be
    My own Soul's sepulchre, for I have ceased
    To justify my deeds unto myself--
    The last infirmity of evil. Aye,
    Thou winged and cloud-cleaving minister,                            30
                                                       [_An Eagle passes._
    Whose happy flight is highest into heaven,
    Well may'st thou swoop so near me--I should be
    Thy prey, and gorge thine eaglets; thou art gone
    Where the eye cannot follow thee; but thine
    Yet pierces downward, onward, or above,
    With a pervading vision.--Beautiful!
    How beautiful is all this visible world![120]
    How glorious in its action and itself!
    But we, who name ourselves its sovereigns, we,
    Half dust, half deity, alike unfit                                  40
    To sink or soar, with our mixed essence make
    A conflict of its elements, and breathe
    The breath of degradation and of pride,
    Contending with low wants and lofty will,
    Till our Mortality predominates,
    And men are--what they name not to themselves,
    And trust not to each other. Hark! the note,
                          [_The Shepherd's pipe in the distance is heard._
    The natural music of the mountain reed--
    For here the patriarchal days are not
    A pastoral fable--pipes in the liberal air,                         50
    Mixed with the sweet bells of the sauntering herd;[121]
    My soul would drink those echoes. Oh, that I were
    The viewless spirit of a lovely sound,
    A living voice, a breathing harmony,
    A bodiless enjoyment[122]--born and dying
    With the blest tone which made me!

                   _Enter from below a_ CHAMOIS HUNTER.

    _Chamois Hunter_.                 Even so
    This way the Chamois leapt: her nimble feet
    Have baffled me; my gains to-day will scarce
    Repay my break-neck travail.--What is here?
    Who seems not of my trade, and yet hath reached                     60
    A height which none even of our mountaineers,
    Save our best hunters, may attain: his garb
    Is goodly, his mien manly, and his air
    Proud as a free-born peasant's, at this distance:
    I will approach him nearer.

    _Man_. (_not perceiving the other_). To be thus--
    Grey-haired with anguish, like these blasted pines,
    Wrecks of a single winter, barkless, branchless,[123]
    A blighted trunk upon a cursed root,
    Which but supplies a feeling to Decay--
    And to be thus, eternally but thus,                                 70
    Having been otherwise! Now furrowed o'er
    With wrinkles, ploughed by moments, not by years
    And hours, all tortured into ages--hours
    Which I outlive!--Ye toppling crags of ice!
    Ye Avalanches, whom a breath draws down
    In mountainous o'erwhelming, come and crush me!
    I hear ye momently above, beneath,
    Crash with a frequent conflict;[124] but ye pass,
    And only fall on things that still would live;
    On the young flourishing forest, or the hut                         80
    And hamlet of the harmless villager.

    _C. Hun_. The mists begin to rise from up the valley;
    I'll warn him to descend, or he may chance
    To lose at once his way and life together.

    _Man_. The mists boil up around the glaciers; clouds
    Rise curling fast beneath me, white and sulphury,
    Like foam from the roused ocean of deep Hell,[aw]
    Whose every wave breaks on a living shore,
    Heaped with the damned like pebbles.--I am giddy.[125]

    _C. Hun_. I must approach him cautiously; if near,                  90
    A sudden step will startle him, and he
    Seems tottering already.

    _Man_.                  Mountains have fallen,
    Leaving a gap in the clouds, and with the shock
    Rocking their Alpine brethren; filling up
    The ripe green valleys with Destruction's splinters;
    Damming the rivers with a sudden dash,
    Which crushed the waters into mist, and made
    Their fountains find another channel--thus,
    Thus, in its old age, did Mount Rosenberg--[126]
    Why stood I not beneath it?

    _C. Hun_.                  Friend! have a care,                    100
    Your next step may be fatal!--for the love
    Of Him who made you, stand not on that brink!

    _Man_. (_not hearing him_).
    Such would have been for me a fitting tomb;
    My bones had then been quiet in their depth;
    They had not then been strewn upon the rocks
    For the wind's pastime--as thus--thus they shall be--
    In this one plunge.--Farewell, ye opening Heavens!
    Look not upon me thus reproachfully--
    You were not meant for me--Earth! take these atoms!

         [_As_ MANFRED _is in act to spring from the cliff, the_
      CHAMOIS HUNTER _seizes and retains him with a sudden grasp._

    _C. Hun_. Hold, madman!--though aweary of thy life,                110
    Stain not our pure vales with thy guilty blood:
    Away with me----I will not quit my hold.

    _Man_. I am most sick at heart--nay, grasp me not--
    I am all feebleness--the mountains whirl
    Spinning around me----I grow blind----What art thou?

    _C. Hun_. I'll answer that anon.--Away with me----
    The clouds grow thicker----there--now lean on me--
    Place your foot here--here, take this staff, and cling
    A moment to that shrub--now give me your hand,
    And hold fast by my girdle--softly--well--                         120
    The Chalet will be gained within an hour:
    Come on, we'll quickly find a surer footing,
    And something like a pathway, which the torrent
    Hath washed since winter.--Come,'tis bravely done--
    You should have been a hunter.--Follow me.

           [_As they descend the rocks with difficulty, the scene closes._




                                 ACT II.


             SCENE I.--_A Cottage among the Bernese Alps_.--
                    MANFRED _and the_ CHAMOIS HUNTER.

    _C. Hun_. No--no--yet pause--thou must not yet go forth;
    Thy mind and body are alike unfit
    To trust each other, for some hours, at least;
    When thou art better, I will be thy guide--
    But whither?

    _Man_.       It imports not: I do know
    My route full well, and need no further guidance.

    _C. Hun_. Thy garb and gait bespeak thee of high lineage--
    One of the many chiefs, whose castled crags
    Look o'er the lower valleys--which of these
    May call thee lord? I only know their portals;                      10
    My way of life leads me but rarely down
    To bask by the huge hearths of those old halls,
    Carousing with the vassals; but the paths,
    Which step from out our mountains to their doors,
    I know from childhood--which of these is thine?

    _Man_. No matter.

    _C. Hun_.         Well, Sir, pardon me the question,
    And be of better cheer. Come, taste my wine;
    'Tis of an ancient vintage; many a day
    'T has thawed my veins among our glaciers, now
    Let it do thus for thine--Come, pledge me fairly!                   20

    _Man_. Away, away! there's blood upon the brim!
    Will it then never--never sink in the earth?

    _C. Hun_. What dost thou mean? thy senses wander from thee.

    _Man_. I say 'tis blood--my blood! the pure warm stream
    Which ran in the veins of my fathers, and in ours
    When we were in our youth, and had one heart,
    And loved each other as we should not love,[127]
    And this was shed: but still it rises up,
    Colouring the clouds, that shut me out from Heaven,
    Where thou art not--and I shall never be.                           30

    _C. Hun_. Man of strange words, and some half-maddening sin,[ax]
    Which makes thee people vacancy, whate'er
    Thy dread and sufferance be, there's comfort yet--
    The aid of holy men, and heavenly patience----

    _Man_. Patience--and patience! Hence--that word was made
    For brutes of burthen, not for birds of prey!
    Preach it to mortals of a dust like thine,--
    I am not of thine order.

    _C. Hun_.                Thanks to Heaven!
    I would not be of thine for the free fame
    Of William Tell; but whatsoe'er thine ill,                          40
    It must be borne, and these wild starts are useless.

    _Man_. Do I not bear it?--Look on me--I live.

    _C. Hun._ This is convulsion, and no healthful life.

    _Man_. I tell thee, man! I have lived many years,
    Many long years, but they are nothing now
    To those which I must number: ages--ages--
    Space and eternity--and consciousness,
    With the fierce thirst of death--and still unslaked!

    _C. Hun_. Why on thy brow the seal of middle age
    Hath scarce been set; I am thine elder far.                         50

    _Man_. Think'st thou existence doth depend on time?[128]
    It doth; but actions are our epochs: mine
    Have made my days and nights imperishable,
    Endless, and all alike, as sands on the shore,
    Innumerable atoms; and one desert,
    Barren and cold, on which the wild waves break,
    But nothing rests, save carcasses and wrecks,
    Rocks, and the salt-surf weeds of bitterness.

    _C. Hun_. Alas! he's mad--but yet I must not leave him.

    _Man_. I would I were--for then the things I see                    60
    Would be but a distempered dream.

    _C. Hun_.                         What is it
    That thou dost see, or think thou look'st upon?

    _Man_. Myself, and thee--a peasant of the Alps--
    Thy humble virtues, hospitable home,
    And spirit patient, pious, proud, and free;
    Thy self-respect, grafted on innocent thoughts;
    Thy days of health, and nights of sleep; thy toils,
    By danger dignified, yet guiltless; hopes
    Of cheerful old age and a quiet grave,
    With cross and garland over its green turf,                         70
    And thy grandchildren's love for epitaph!
    This do I see--and then I look within--
    It matters not--my Soul was scorched already!

    _C. Hun_. And would'st thou then exchange thy lot for mine?

    _Man_. No, friend! I would not wrong thee, nor exchange
    My lot with living being: I can bear--
    However wretchedly, 'tis still to bear--
    In life what others could not brook to dream,
    But perish in their slumber.

    _C. Hun_.                    And with this--
    This cautious feeling for another's pain,                           80
    Canst thou be black with evil?--say not so.
    Can one of gentle thoughts have wreaked revenge
    Upon his enemies?

    _Man_.             Oh! no, no, no!
    My injuries came down on those who loved me--
    On those whom I best loved: I never quelled
    An enemy, save in my just defence--
    But my embrace was fatal.

    _C. Hun_.                Heaven give thee rest!
    And Penitence restore thee to thyself;
    My prayers shall be for thee.

    _Man_.                        I need them not,
    But can endure thy pity. I depart--                                 90
    'Tis time--farewell!--Here's gold, and thanks for thee--
    No words--it is thy due.--Follow me not--
    I know my path--the mountain peril's past:
    And once again I charge thee, follow not!
                                                          [_Exit_ MANFRED.


          SCENE II.--_A lower Valley in the Alps.--A Cataract_.

                             _Enter_ MANFRED.

    It is not noon--the Sunbow's rays[129] still arch
    The torrent with the many hues of heaven,
    And roll the sheeted silver's waving column
    O'er the crag's headlong perpendicular,
    And fling its lines of foaming light along,
    And to and fro, like the pale courser's tail,
    The Giant steed, to be bestrode by Death,
    As told in the Apocalypse.[130] No eyes
    But mine now drink this sight of loveliness;
    I should be sole in this sweet solitude,                            10
    And with the Spirit of the place divide
    The homage of these waters.--I will call her.

                 [MANFRED _takes some of the water into the palm of his
                 hand and flings it into the air, muttering the ajuration.
                 After a pause, the_ WITCH OF THE ALPS _rises beneath
                 the arch of the sunbow of the torrent._

    Beautiful Spirit! with thy hair of light,
    And dazzling eyes of glory, in whose form
    The charms of Earth's least mortal daughters grow
    To an unearthly stature, in an essence
    Of purer elements; while the hues of youth,--
    Carnationed like a sleeping Infant's cheek,
    Rocked by the beating of her mother's heart,
    Or the rose tints, which Summer's twilight leaves                   20
    Upon the lofty Glacier's virgin snow,
    The blush of earth embracing with her Heaven,--
    Tinge thy celestial aspect, and make tame
    The beauties of the Sunbow which bends o'er thee.
    Beautiful Spirit! in thy calm clear brow,
    Wherein is glassed serenity of Soul,[ay]
    Which of itself shows immortality,
    I read that thou wilt pardon to a Son
    Of Earth, whom the abstruser powers permit
    At times to commune with them--if that he                           30
    Avail him of his spells--to call thee thus,
    And gaze on thee a moment.

    _Witch_.                   Son of Earth!
    I know thee, and the Powers which give thee power!
    I know thee for a man of many thoughts,
    And deeds of good and ill, extreme in both,
    Fatal and fated in thy sufferings.
    I have expected this--what would'st thou with me?

    _Man_. To look upon thy beauty--nothing further.
    The face of the earth hath maddened me, and I
    Take refuge in her mysteries, and pierce                            40
    To the abodes of those who govern her--
    But they can nothing aid me. I have sought
    From them what they could not bestow, and now
    I search no further.

    _Witch_.             What could be the quest
    Which is not in the power of the most powerful,
    The rulers of the invisible?

    _Man_.                       A boon;--
    But why should I repeat it? 'twere in vain.

    _Witch_. I know not that; let thy lips utter it.

    _Man_. Well, though it torture me, 'tis but the same;
    My pang shall find a voice. From my youth upwards                   50
    My Spirit walked not with the souls of men,
    Nor looked upon the earth with human eyes;
    The thirst of their ambition was not mine,
    The aim of their existence was not mine;
    My joys--my griefs--my passions--and my powers,
    Made me a stranger; though I wore the form,
    I had no sympathy with breathing flesh,
    Nor midst the Creatures of Clay that girded me
    Was there but One who--but of her anon.
    I said with men, and with the thoughts of men,                      60
    I held but slight communion; but instead,
    My joy was in the wilderness,--to breathe
    The difficult air of the iced mountain's top,[131]
    Where the birds dare not build--nor insect's wing
    Flit o'er the herbless granite; or to plunge
    Into the torrent, and to roll along
    On the swift whirl of the new-breaking wave
    Of river-stream, or Ocean, in their flow.[132]
    In these my early strength exulted; or
    To follow through the night the moving moon,[133]                   70
    The stars and their development; or catch
    The dazzling lightnings till my eyes grew dim;
    Or to look, list'ning, on the scattered leaves,
    While Autumn winds were at their evening song.
    These were my pastimes, and to be alone;
    For if the beings, of whom I was one,--
    Hating to be so,--crossed me in my path,
    I felt myself degraded back to them,
    And was all clay again. And then I dived,
    In my lone wanderings, to the caves of Death,                       80
    Searching its cause in its effect; and drew
    From withered bones, and skulls, and heaped up dust
    Conclusions most forbidden.[134] Then I passed--
    The nights of years in sciences untaught,
    Save in the old-time; and with time and toil,
    And terrible ordeal, and such penance
    As in itself hath power upon the air,
    And spirits that do compass air and earth,
    Space, and the peopled Infinite, I made
    Mine eyes familiar with Eternity,                                   90
    Such as, before me, did the Magi, and
    He who from out their fountain-dwellings raised
    Eros and Anteros,[135] at Gadara,
    As I do thee;--and with my knowledge grew
    The thirst of knowledge, and the power and joy
    Of this most bright intelligence, until----

    _Witch_. Proceed.

    _Man_.            Oh! I but thus prolonged my words,
    Boasting these idle attributes, because
    As I approach the core of my heart's grief--
    But--to my task. I have not named to thee                          100
    Father or mother, mistress, friend, or being,
    With whom I wore the chain of human ties;
    If I had such, they seemed not such to me--
    Yet there was One----

    _Witch_.                Spare not thyself--proceed.

    _Man_. She was like me in lineaments--her eyes--
    Her hair--her features--all, to the very tone
    Even of her voice, they said were like to mine;
    But softened all, and tempered into beauty:
    She had the same lone thoughts and wanderings,
    The quest of hidden knowledge, and a mind                          110
    To comprehend the Universe: nor these
    Alone, but with them gentler powers than mine,
    Pity, and smiles, and tears--which I had not;
    And tenderness--but that I had for her;
    Humility--and that I never had.
    Her faults were mine--her virtues were her own--
    I loved her, and destroyed her!

    _Witch_.                          With thy hand?

    _Man_. Not with my hand, but heart, which broke her heart;
    It gazed on mine, and withered. I have shed
    Blood, but not hers--and yet her blood was shed;                   120
    I saw--and could not stanch it.

    _Witch_.                         And for this--
    A being of the race thou dost despise--
    The order, which thine own would rise above,
    Mingling with us and ours,--thou dost forego
    The gifts of our great knowledge, and shrink'st back
    To recreant mortality----Away!

    _Man_. Daughter of Air! I tell thee, since that hour--
    But words are breath--look on me in my sleep,
    Or watch my watchings--Come and sit by me!
    My solitude is solitude no more,                                   130
    But peopled with the Furies;--I have gnashed
    My teeth in darkness till returning morn,
    Then cursed myself till sunset;--I have prayed
    For madness as a blessing--'tis denied me.
    I have affronted Death--but in the war
    Of elements the waters shrunk from me,[136]
    And fatal things passed harmless; the cold hand
    Of an all-pitiless Demon held me back,
    Back by a single hair, which would not break.
    In Fantasy, Imagination, all                                       140
    The affluence of my soul--which one day was
    A Croesus in creation--I plunged deep,
    But, like an ebbing wave, it dashed me back
    Into the gulf of my unfathomed thought.
    I plunged amidst Mankind--Forgetfulness[137]
    I sought in all, save where 'tis to be found--
    And that I have to learn--my Sciences,
    My long pursued and superhuman art,
    Is mortal here: I dwell in my despair--
    And live--and live for ever.[az]

    _Witch_.                     It may be                            150
    That I can aid thee.

    _Man_.               To do this thy power
    Must wake the dead, or lay me low with them.
    Do so--in any shape--in any hour--
    With any torture--so it be the last.

    _Witch_. That is not in my province; but if thou
    Wilt swear obedience to my will, and do
    My bidding, it may help thee to thy wishes.

    _Man_. I will not swear--Obey! and whom? the Spirits
    Whose presence I command, and be the slave
    Of those who served me--Never!

    _Witch_.                       Is this all?                        160
    Hast thou no gentler answer?--Yet bethink thee,
    And pause ere thou rejectest.

    _Man_.                       I have said it.

    _Witch_. Enough! I may retire then--say!

    _Man_.                                       Retire!

                                                [_The_ WITCH _disappears._

    _Man_. (_alone_). We are the fools of Time and Terror: Days
    Steal on us, and steal from us; yet we live,
    Loathing our life, and dreading still to die.
    In all the days of this detested yoke--
    This vital weight upon the struggling heart,
    Which sinks with sorrow, or beats quick with pain,
    Or joy that ends in agony or faintness--                           170
    In all the days of past and future--for
    In life there is no present--we can number
    How few--how less than few--wherein the soul
    Forbears to pant for death, and yet draws back
    As from a stream in winter, though the chill[ba]
    Be but a moment's. I have one resource
    Still in my science--I can call the dead,
    And ask them what it is we dread to be:
    The sternest answer can but be the Grave,
    And that is nothing: if they answer not--                          180
    The buried Prophet answered to the Hag
    Of Endor; and the Spartan Monarch drew
    From the Byzantine maid's unsleeping spirit
    An answer and his destiny--he slew
    That which he loved, unknowing what he slew,
    And died unpardoned--though he called in aid
    The Phyxian Jove, and in Phigalia roused
    The Arcadian Evocators to compel
    The indignant shadow to depose her wrath,
    Or fix her term of vengeance--she replied                          190
    In words of dubious import, but fulfilled.[138]
    If I had never lived, that which I love
    Had still been living; had I never loved,
    That which I love would still be beautiful,
    Happy and giving happiness. What is she?
    What is she now?--a sufferer for my sins--
    A thing I dare not think upon--or nothing.
    Within few hours I shall not call in vain--
    Yet in this hour I dread the thing I dare:
    Until this hour I never shrunk to gaze                             200
    On spirit, good or evil--now I tremble,
    And feel a strange cold thaw upon my heart.
    But I can act even what I most abhor,
    And champion human fears.--The night approaches.
                                                                  [_Exit._


            SCENE III.--_The summit of the Jungfrau Mountain._

                          _Enter_ FIRST DESTINY.

    The Moon is rising broad, and round, and bright;
    And here on snows, where never human foot[139]
    Of common mortal trod, we nightly tread,
    And leave no traces: o'er the savage sea,
    The glassy ocean of the mountain ice,
    We skim its rugged breakers, which put on
    The aspect of a tumbling tempest's foam,
    Frozen in a moment[140]--a dead Whirlpool's image:
    And this most steep fantastic pinnacle,
    The fretwork of some earthquake--where the clouds                   10
    Pause to repose themselves in passing by--
    Is sacred to our revels, or our vigils;
    Here do I wait my sisters, on our way
    To the Hall of Arimanes--for to-night
    Is our great festival[141]--'tis strange they come not.

                       _A Voice without, singing._

              The Captive Usurper,
                Hurled down from the throne,
              Lay buried in torpor,
                Forgotten and lone;
              I broke through his slumbers,                             20
                I shivered his chain,
              I leagued him with numbers--
                He's Tyrant again!
    With the blood of a million he'll answer my care,
    With a Nation's destruction--his flight and despair![142]


                         _Second Voice, without._

    The Ship sailed on, the Ship sailed fast,
    But I left not a sail, and I left not a mast;
    There is not a plank of the hull or the deck,
    And there is not a wretch to lament o'er his wreck;
    Save one, whom I held, as he swam, by the hair,                     30
    And he was a subject well worthy my care;
    A traitor on land, and a pirate at sea--[143]
    But I saved him to wreak further havoc for me!

                       FIRST DESTINY, _answering._

          The City lies sleeping;
            The morn, to deplore it,
          May dawn on it weeping:
            Sullenly, slowly,
          The black plague flew o'er it--
            Thousands lie lowly;
          Tens of thousands shall perish;                               40
            The living shall fly from
          The sick they should cherish;
            But nothing can vanquish
          The touch that they die from.
            Sorrow and anguish,
          And evil and dread,
            Envelope a nation;
          The blest are the dead,
          Who see not the sight
            Of their own desolation;                                    50
          This work of a night--
    This wreck of a realm--this deed of my doing--
    For ages I've done, and shall still be renewing!

                _Enter the_ SECOND _and_ THIRD DESTINIES.

                               _The Three._

    Our hands contain the hearts of men,
      Our footsteps are their graves;
    We only give to take again
      The Spirits of our slaves!

    _First Des_. Welcome!--Where's Nemesis?

    _Second Des_.                          At some great work;
    But what I know not, for my hands were full.

    _Third Des_. Behold she cometh.

                             _Enter_ NEMESIS.

    _First Des_.                     Say, where hast thou been?         60
    My Sisters and thyself are slow to-night.

    _Nem_. I was detained repairing shattered thrones--
    Marrying fools, restoring dynasties--
    Avenging men upon their enemies,
    And making them repent their own revenge;
    Goading the wise to madness; from the dull
    Shaping out oracles to rule the world
    Afresh--for they were waxing out of date,
    And mortals dared to ponder for themselves,
    To weigh kings in the balance--and to speak                         70
    Of Freedom, the forbidden fruit.--Away!
    We have outstayed the hour--mount we our clouds!
                                                                [_Exeunt._


    SCENE IV.--_The Hall of Arimanes._[144]--_Arimanes on his Throne,
            a Globe of Fire,[145] surrounded by the Spirits._

                          _Hymn of the_ SPIRITS.

    Hail to our Master!--Prince of Earth and Air!
      Who walks the clouds and waters--in his hand
    The sceptre of the Elements, which tear
      Themselves to chaos at his high command!
    He breatheth--and a tempest shakes the sea;
      He speaketh--and the clouds reply in thunder;
    He gazeth--from his glance the sunbeams flee;
      He moveth--Earthquakes rend the world asunder.
    Beneath his footsteps the Volcanoes rise;
      His shadow is the Pestilence: his path                            10
    The comets herald through the crackling skies;[bb]
      And Planets turn to ashes at his wrath.
    To him War offers daily sacrifice;
      To him Death pays his tribute; Life is his,
    With all its Infinite of agonies--
      And his the Spirit of whatever is!

                   _Enter the_ DESTINIES _and_ NEMESIS.

    _First Des_. Glory to Arimanes! on the earth
    His power increaseth--both my sisters did
    His bidding, nor did I neglect my duty!

    _Second Des_. Glory to Arimanes! we who bow                         20
    The necks of men, bow down before his throne!

    _Third Des_. Glory to Arimanes! we await
    His nod!

    _Nem_.    Sovereign of Sovereigns! we are thine,
    And all that liveth, more or less, is ours,
    And most things wholly so; still to increase
    Our power, increasing thine, demands our care,
    And we are vigilant. Thy late commands
    Have been fulfilled to the utmost.

                             _Enter_ MANFRED.

    _A Spirit_.                         What is here?
    A mortal!--Thou most rash and fatal wretch,
    Bow down and worship!

    _Second Spirit_.              I do know the man--                   30
    A Magian of great power, and fearful skill!

    _Third Spirit_. Bow down and worship, slave!--What, know'st thou not
    Thine and our Sovereign?--Tremble, and obey!

    _All the Spirits_. Prostrate thyself, and thy condemned clay,
    Child of the Earth! or dread the worst.

    _Man_.                                   I know it;
    And yet ye see I kneel not.

    _Fourth Spirit_.             'Twill be taught thee.

    _Man_. 'Tis taught already;--many a night on the earth,
    On the bare ground, have I bowed down my face,
    And strewed my head with ashes; I have known
    The fulness of humiliation--for                                     40
    I sunk before my vain despair, and knelt
    To my own desolation.

    _Fifth Spirit_.         Dost thou dare
    Refuse to Arimanes on his throne
    What the whole earth accords, beholding not
    The terror of his Glory?--Crouch! I say.

    _Man_. Bid _him_ bow down to that which is above him,
    The overruling Infinite--the Maker
    Who made him not for worship--let him kneel,
    And we will kneel together.

    _The Spirits_.               Crush the worm!
    Tear him in pieces!--

    _First Des_.            Hence! Avaunt!--he's mine.                  50
    Prince of the Powers invisible! This man
    Is of no common order, as his port
    And presence here denote: his sufferings
    Have been of an immortal nature--like
    Our own; his knowledge, and his powers and will,
    As far as is compatible with clay,
    Which clogs the ethereal essence, have been such
    As clay hath seldom borne; his aspirations
    Have been beyond the dwellers of the earth,
    And they have only taught him what we know--                        60
    That knowledge is not happiness, and science[146]
    But an exchange of ignorance for that
    Which is another kind of ignorance.
    This is not all--the passions, attributes
    Of Earth and Heaven, from which no power, nor being,
    Nor breath from the worm upwards is exempt,
    Have pierced his heart; and in their consequence
    Made him a thing--which--I who pity not,
    Yet pardon those who pity. He is mine--
    And thine it may be; be it so, or not--                             70
    No other Spirit in this region hath
    A soul like his--or power upon his soul.

    _Nem_. What doth he here then?

    _First Des_.                   Let _him_ answer that.

    _Man_. Ye know what I have known; and without power
    I could not be amongst ye: but there are
    Powers deeper still beyond--I come in quest
    Of such, to answer unto what I seek.

    _Nem_. What would'st thou?

    _Man_.                     _Thou_ canst not reply to me.
    Call up the dead--my question is for them.

    _Nem_. Great Arimanes, doth thy will avouch                         80
    The wishes of this mortal?

    _Ari_.                       Yea.

    _Nem_.                            Whom wouldst thou
    Uncharnel?

    _Man_.      One without a tomb--call up
    Astarte.[147]


                                 NEMESIS.

              Shadow! or Spirit!
                Whatever thou art,
              Which still doth inherit[bc]
                The whole or a part
              Of the form of thy birth,
                Of the mould of thy clay,
              Which returned to the earth,                              90
                Re-appear to the day!
              Bear what thou borest,
                The heart and the form,
              And the aspect thou worest
                Redeem from the worm.
            Appear!--Appear!--Appear!
            Who sent thee there requires thee here!

                [_The Phantom of_ ASTARTE _rises and stands in the midst_.

    _Man_. Can this be death? there's bloom upon her cheek;
    But now I see it is no living hue,
    But a strange hectic--like the unnatural red                       100
    Which Autumn plants upon the perished leaf.[148]
    It is the same! Oh, God! that I should dread
    To look upon the same--Astarte!--No,
    I cannot speak to her--but bid her speak--
    Forgive me or condemn me.

                                 NEMESIS.

            By the Power which hath broken
              The grave which enthralled thee,
            Speak to him who hath spoken.
              Or those who have called thee!

    _Man_.                      She is silent,
    And in that silence I am more than answered.                       110

    _Nem_. My power extends no further. Prince of Air!
    It rests with thee alone--command her voice.

    _Ari_. Spirit--obey this sceptre!

    _Nem_.                            Silent still!
    She is not of our order, but belongs
    To the other powers. Mortal! thy quest is vain,
    And we are baffled also.

    _Man_.                  Hear me, hear me--
    Astarte! my beloved! speak to me:
    I have so much endured--so much endure--
    Look on me! the grave hath not changed thee more
    Than I am changed for thee. Thou lovedst me                        120
    Too much, as I loved thee: we were not made
    To torture thus each other--though it were
    The deadliest sin to love as we have loved.
    Say that thou loath'st me not--that I do bear
    This punishment for both--that thou wilt be
    One of the blessed--and that I shall die;
    For hitherto all hateful things conspire
    To bind me in existence--in a life
    Which makes me shrink from Immortality--
    A future like the past. I cannot rest.                             130
    I know not what I ask, nor what I seek:
    I feel but what thou art, and what I am;
    And I would hear yet once before I perish
    The voice which was my music--Speak to me!
    For I have called on thee in the still night,
    Startled the slumbering birds from the hushed boughs,
    And woke the mountain wolves, and made the caves
    Acquainted with thy vainly echoed name,
    Which answered me--many things answered me--
    Spirits and men--but thou wert silent all.                         140
    Yet speak to me! I have outwatched the stars,
    And gazed o'er heaven in vain in search of thee.
    Speak to me! I have wandered o'er the earth,
    And never found thy likeness--Speak to me!
    Look on the fiends around--they feel for me:
    I fear them not, and feel for thee alone.
    Speak to me! though it be in wrath;--but say--
    I reck not what--but let me hear thee once--
    This once--once more!

    _Phantom of Astarte_.   Manfred!

    _Man_.                           Say on, say on--
    I live but in the sound--it is thy voice!                          150

    _Phan_. Manfred! To-morrow ends thine earthly ills.
    Farewell!

    _Man_.    Yet one word more--am I forgiven?

    _Phan_. Farewell!

    _Man_.            Say, shall we meet again?

    _Phan_.                                    Farewell!

    _Man_. One word for mercy! Say thou lovest me.

    _Phan_. Manfred!

                                    [_The Spirit of_ ASTARTE _disappears_.

    _Nem_.           She's gone, and will not be recalled:
    Her words will be fulfilled. Return to the earth.

    _A Spirit_. He is convulsed--This is to be a mortal,
    And seek the things beyond mortality.

    _Another Spirit_. Yet, see, he mastereth himself, and makes
    His torture tributary to his will.[149]                            160
    Had he been one of us, he would have made
    An awful Spirit.

    _Nem_.           Hast thou further question
    Of our great Sovereign, or his worshippers?

    _Man_. None.

    _Nem_.       Then for a time farewell.

    _Man_. We meet then! Where? On the earth?--
    Even as thou wilt: and for the grace accorded
    I now depart a debtor. Fare ye well!
                                                          [_Exit_ MANFRED.

                                 ACT III.

             SCENE I.--_A Hall in the Castle of Manfred_.[150]

                          MANFRED _and_ HERMAN.

    _Man_. What is the hour?

    _Her_.                   It wants but one till sunset,
    And promises a lovely twilight.

    _Man_.                          Say,
    Are all things so disposed of in the tower
    As I directed?

    _Her_.        All, my Lord, are ready:
    Here is the key and casket.[151]

    _Man_.                        It is well:
    Thou mayst retire.                                     [_Exit_ HERMAN.

    _Man_. (_alone_).     There is a calm upon me--
    Inexplicable stillness! which till now
    Did not belong to what I knew of life.
    If that I did not know Philosophy
    To be of all our vanities the motliest,                             10
    The merest word that ever fooled the ear
    From out the schoolman's jargon, I should deem
    The golden secret, the sought "Kalon," found,[152]
    And seated in my soul. It will not last,
    But it is well to have known it, though but once:
    It hath enlarged my thoughts with a new sense,
    And I within my tablets would note down
    That there is such a feeling. Who is there?

                            _Re-enter_ HERMAN.

    _Her_. My Lord, the Abbot of St. Maurice craves[153]
    To greet your presence.

                    _Enter the_ ABBOT OF ST. MAURICE.

    _Abbot_.                 Peace be with Count Manfred!              20

    _Man_. Thanks, holy father! welcome to these walls;
    Thy presence honours them, and blesseth those
    Who dwell within them.

    _Abbot_.              Would it were so, Count!--
    But I would fain confer with thee alone.

    _Man_. Herman, retire.--What would my reverend guest?

    _Abbot_. Thus, without prelude:--Age and zeal--my office--
    And good intent must plead my privilege;
    Our near, though not acquainted neighbourhood,
    May also be my herald. Rumours strange,
    And of unholy nature, are abroad,                                   30
    And busy with thy name--a noble name
    For centuries: may he who bears it now
    Transmit it unimpaired!

    _Man_.                  Proceed,--I listen.

    _Abbot_. 'Tis said thou holdest converse with the things
    Which are forbidden to the search of man;
    That with the dwellers of the dark abodes,
    The many evil and unheavenly spirits
    Which walk the valley of the Shade of Death,
    Thou communest. I know that with mankind,
    Thy fellows in creation, thou dost rarely                           40
    Exchange thy thoughts, and that thy solitude
    Is as an Anchorite's--were it but holy.

    _Man_. And what are they who do avouch these things?

    _Abbot_. My pious brethren--the scared peasantry--
    Even thy own vassals--who do look on thee
    With most unquiet eyes. Thy life's in peril!

    _Man_. Take it.

    _Abbot_.        I come to save, and not destroy:
    I would not pry into thy secret soul;
    But if these things be sooth, there still is time
    For penitence and pity: reconcile thee                              50
    With the true church, and through the church to Heaven.

    _Man_. I hear thee. This is my reply--whate'er
    I may have been, or am, doth rest between
    Heaven and myself--I shall not choose a mortal
    To be my mediator--Have I sinned
    Against your ordinances? prove and punish![154]

    _Abbot_. My son! I did not speak of punishment,[155]
    But penitence and pardon;--with thyself
    The choice of such remains--and for the last,
    Our institutions and our strong belief                              60
    Have given me power to smooth the path from sin
    To higher hope and better thoughts; the first
    I leave to Heaven,--"Vengeance is mine alone!"
    So saith the Lord, and with all humbleness
    His servant echoes back the awful word.

    _Man_. Old man! there is no power in holy men,
    Nor charm in prayer, nor purifying form
    Of penitence, nor outward look, nor fast,
    Nor agony--nor, greater than all these,
    The innate tortures of that deep Despair,                           70
    Which is Remorse without the fear of Hell,
    But all in all sufficient to itself
    Would make a hell of Heaven--can exorcise
    From out the unbounded spirit the quick sense
    Of its own sins--wrongs--sufferance--and revenge
    Upon itself; there is no future pang
    Can deal that justice on the self--condemned
    He deals on his own soul.

    _Abbot_.                 All this is well;
    For this will pass away, and be succeeded
    By an auspicious hope, which shall look up                          80
    With calm assurafice to that blessed place,
    Which all who seek may win, whatever be
    Their earthly errors, so they be atoned:
    And the commencement of atonement is
    The sense of its necessity. Say on--
    And all our church can teach thee shall be taught;
    And all we can absolve thee shall be pardoned.

    _Man_. When Rome's sixth Emperor[156] was near his last,
    The victim of a self-inflicted wound,
    To shun the torments of a public death[bd]                          90
    From senates once his slaves, a certain soldier,
    With show of loyal pity, would have stanched
    The gushing throat with his officious robe;
    The dying Roman thrust him back, and said--
    Some empire still in his expiring glance--
    "It is too late--is this fidelity?"

    _Abbot_. And what of this?

    _Man_.                     I answer with the Roman--
    "It is too late!"

    _Abbot_.           It never can be so,
    To reconcile thyself with thy own soul,
    And thy own soul with Heaven. Hast thou no hope?                   100
    'Tis strange--even those who do despair above,
    Yet shape themselves some fantasy on earth,
    To which frail twig they cling, like drowning men.

    _Man_. Aye--father! I have had those early visions,
    And noble aspirations in my youth,
    To make my own the mind of other men,
    The enlightener of nations; and to rise
    I knew not whither--it might be to fall;
    But fall, even as the mountain-cataract,
    Which having leapt from its more dazzling height,                  110
    Even in the foaming strength of its abyss,
    (Which casts up misty columns that become
    Clouds raining from the re-ascended skies,)[157]
    Lies low but mighty still.--But this is past,
    My thoughts mistook themselves.

    _Abbot_.                         And wherefore so?

    _Man_.I could not tame my nature down; for he
    Must serve who fain would sway; and soothe, and sue,
    And watch all time, and pry into all place,
    And be a living Lie, who would become
    A mighty thing amongst the mean--and such                          120
    The mass are; I disdained to mingle with
    A herd, though to be leader--and of wolves,
    The lion is alone, and so am I.

    _Abbot_. And why not live and act with other men?

    _Man_. Because my nature was averse from life;
    And yet not cruel; for I would not make,
    But find a desolation. Like the Wind,
    The red-hot breath of the most lone Simoom,[158]
    Which dwells but in the desert, and sweeps o'er
    The barren sands which bear no shrubs to blast,                    130
    And revels o'er their wild and arid waves,
    And seeketh not, so that it is not sought,
    But being met is deadly,--such hath been
    The course of my existence; but there came
    Things in my path which are no more.

    _Abbot_.                             Alas!
    I 'gin to fear that thou art past all aid
    From me and from my calling; yet so young,
    I still would----

    _Man_.              Look on me! there is an order
    Of mortals on the earth, who do become
    Old in their youth, and die ere middle age,[159]                   140
    Without the violence of warlike death;
    Some perishing of pleasure--some of study--
    Some worn with toil, some of mere weariness,--
    Some of disease--and some insanity--
    And some of withered, or of broken hearts;
    For this last is a malady which slays
    More than are numbered in the lists of Fate,
    Taking all shapes, and bearing many names.
    Look upon me! for even of all these things
    Have I partaken; and of all these things,                          150
    One were enough; then wonder not that I
    Am what I am, but that I ever was,
    Or having been, that I am still on earth.

    _Abbot_. Yet, hear me still--

    _Man_.                        Old man! I do respect
    Thine order, and revere thine years; I deem
    Thy purpose pious, but it is in vain:
    Think me not churlish; I would spare thyself,
    Far more than me, in shunning at this time
    All further colloquy--and so--farewell.
                                                            [Exit MANFRED.

    _Abbot_. This should have been a noble creature: he                160
    Hath all the energy which would have made
    A goodly frame of glorious elements,
    Had they been wisely mingled; as it is,
    It is an awful chaos--Light and Darkness--
    And mind and dust--and passions and pure thoughts
    Mixed, and contending without end or order,--
    All dormant or destructive. He will perish--
    And yet he must not--I will try once more,
    For such are worth redemption; and my duty
    Is to dare all things for a righteous end.                         170
    I'll follow him--but cautiously, though surely.
                                                              [Exit ABBOT.


                      SCENE II.--_Another Chamber_.

                          MANFRED _and_ HERMAN.

    _Her_. My lord, you bade me wait on you at sunset:
    He sinks behind the mountain.

    _Man_.                        Doth he so?
    I will look on him.
                            [MANFRED _advances to the Window of the Hall_.
                        Glorious Orb! the idol[160]
    Of early nature, and the vigorous race
    Of undiseased mankind, the giant sons[161]
    Of the embrace of Angels, with a sex
    More beautiful than they, which did draw down
    The erring Spirits who can ne'er return.--
    Most glorious Orb! that wert a worship, ere
    The mystery of thy making was revealed!                             10
    Thou earliest minister of the Almighty,
    Which gladdened, on their mountain tops, the hearts
    Of the Chaldean shepherds, till they poured[162]
    Themselves in orisons! Thou material God!
    And representative of the Unknown--
    Who chose thee for his shadow! Thou chief Star!
    Centre of many stars! which mak'st our earth
    Endurable and temperest the hues
    And hearts of all who walk within thy rays!
    Sire of the seasons! Monarch of the climes,                         20
    And those who dwell in them! for near or far,
    Our inborn spirits have a tint of thee
    Even as our outward aspects;--thou dost rise,
    And shine, and set in glory. Fare thee well!
    I ne'er shall see thee more. As my first glance
    Of love and wonder was for thee, then take
    My latest look: thou wilt not beam on one
    To whom the gifts of life and warmth have been
    Of a more fatal nature. He is gone--
    I follow.                                             [_Exit_ MANFRED.


       SCENE III.--_The Mountains_--_The Castle of Manfred at some
        distance_--_A Terrace before a Tower_.--_Time, Twilight_.

            HERMAN, MANUEL, _and other dependants of_ MANFRED.

    _Her_. 'Tis strange enough! night after night, for years,
    He hath pursued long vigils in this tower,
    Without a witness. I have been within it,--
    So have we all been oft-times; but from it,
    Or its contents, it were impossible
    To draw conclusions absolute, of aught
    His studies tend to. To be sure, there is
    One chamber where none enter: I would give
    The fee of what I have to come these three years,
    To pore upon its mysteries.

    _Manuel_.                  'Twere dangerous;                        10
    Content thyself with what thou know'st already.

    _Her_. Ah! Manuel! thou art elderly and wise,
    And couldst say much; thou hast dwelt within the castle--
    How many years is't?

    _Manuel_.            Ere Count Manfred's birth,
    I served his father, whom he nought resembles.

    _Her_. There be more sons in like predicament!
    But wherein do they differ?

    _Manuel_.                   I speak not
    Of features or of form, but mind and habits;
    Count Sigismund was proud, but gay and free,--
    A warrior and a reveller; he dwelt not                              20
    With books and solitude, nor made the night
    A gloomy vigil, but a festal time,
    Merrier than day; he did not walk the rocks
    And forests like a wolf, nor turn aside
    From men and their delights.

    _Her_.                       Beshrew the hour,
    But those were jocund times! I would that such
    Would visit the old walls again; they look
    As if they had forgotten them.

    _Manuel_.                      These walls
    Must change their chieftain first. Oh! I have seen
    Some strange things in them, Herman.[be]

    _Her_.                               Come, be friendly;             30
    Relate me some to while away our watch:
    I've heard thee darkly speak of an event
    Which happened hereabouts, by this same tower.

    _Manuel_. That was a night indeed! I do remember
    'Twas twilight, as it may be now, and such
    Another evening:--yon red cloud, which rests
    On Eigher's pinnacle,[163] so rested then,--
    So like that it might be the same; the wind
    Was faint and gusty, and the mountain snows
    Began to glitter with the climbing moon;                            40
    Count Manfred was, as now, within his tower,--
    How occupied, we knew not, but with him
    The sole companion of his wanderings
    And watchings--her, whom of all earthly things
    That lived, the only thing he seemed to love,--
    As he, indeed, by blood was bound to do,
    The Lady Astarte, his----[164]
                              Hush! who comes here?

                            _Enter the_ ABBOT.

    _Abbot_. Where is your master?

    _Her_.                          Yonder in the tower.

    _Abbot_. I must speak with him.

    _Manuel_.                       'Tis impossible;
    He is most private, and must not be thus                            50
    Intruded on.

    _Abbot_.      Upon myself I take
    The forfeit of my fault, if fault there be--
    But I must see him.

    _Her_.              Thou hast seen him once
    his eve already.

    _Abbot_.          Herman! I command thee,[bf]
    Knock, and apprize the Count of my approach.

    _Her_. We dare not.

    _Abbot_.            Then it seems I must be herald
    Of my own purpose.

    _Manuel_.          Reverend father, stop--
    I pray you pause.

    _Abbot_.          Why so?

    _Manuel_.                 But step this way,
    And I will tell you further.                                [_Exeunt_.


                   SCENE IV.--_Interior of the Tower_.

                             MANFRED _alone_.

    The stars are forth, the moon above the tops
    Of the snow-shining mountains.--Beautiful!
    I linger yet with Nature, for the Night[165]
    Hath been to me a more familiar face
    Than that of man; and in her starry shade
    Of dim and solitary loveliness,
    I learned the language of another world.
    I do remember me, that in my youth,
    When I was wandering,--upon such a night
    I stood within the Coliseum's wall,[166]                            10
    'Midst the chief relics of almighty Rome;
    The trees which grew along the broken arches
    Waved dark in the blue midnight, and the stars
    Shone through the rents of ruin; from afar
    The watch-dog bayed beyond the Tiber; and
    More near from out the Caesars' palace came
    The owl's long cry, and, interruptedly,[167]
    Of distant sentinels the fitful song
    Begun and died upon the gentle wind.[168]
    Some cypresses beyond the time-worn breach                          20
    Appeared to skirt the horizon, yet they stood
    Within a bowshot. Where the Caesars dwelt,
    And dwell the tuneless birds of night, amidst
    A grove which springs through levelled battlements,
    And twines its roots with the imperial hearths,
    Ivy usurps the laurel's place of growth;
    But the gladiators' bloody Circus stands,
    A noble wreck in ruinous perfection,
    While Caesar's chambers, and the Augustan halls,
    Grovel on earth in indistinct decay.--                              30
    And thou didst shine, thou rolling Moon, upon
    All this, and cast a wide and tender light,
    Which softened down the hoar austerity
    Of rugged desolation, and filled up,
    As 'twere anew, the gaps of centuries;
    Leaving that beautiful which still was so,
    And making that which was not--till the place
    Became religion, and the heart ran o'er
    With silent worship of the Great of old,--
    The dead, but sceptred, Sovereigns, who still rule                  40
    Our spirits from their urns.
                                 'Twas such a night!
    'Tis strange that I recall it at this time;
    But I have found our thoughts take wildest flight
    Even at the moment when they should array
    Themselves in pensive order.

                            _Enter the_ ABBOT.

    _Abbot_.                     My good Lord!
    I crave a second grace for this approach;
    But yet let not my humble zeal offend
    By its abruptness--all it hath of ill
    Recoils on me; its good in the effect
    May light upon your head--could I say _heart_--                      50
    Could I touch _that_, with words or prayers, I should
    Recall a noble spirit which hath wandered,
    But is not yet all lost.

    _Man_.                  Thou know'st me not;
    My days are numbered, and my deeds recorded:
    Retire, or 'twill be dangerous--Away!

    _Abbot_. Thou dost not mean to menace me?

    _Man_.                                   Not I!
    I simply tell thee peril is at hand,
    And would preserve thee.

    _Abbot_.                 What dost thou mean?

    _Man_.                                       Look there!
    What dost thou see?

    _Abbot_.           Nothing.

    _Man_.                      Look there, I say,
    And steadfastly;--now tell me what thou seest?                      60

    _Abbot_. That which should shake me,--but I fear it not:
    I see a dusk and awful figure rise,
    Like an infernal god, from out the earth;
    His face wrapt in a mantle, and his form
    Robed as with angry clouds: he stands between
    Thyself and me--but I do fear him not.

    _Man_. Thou hast no cause--he shall not harm thee--but
    His sight may shock thine old limbs into palsy.
    I say to thee--Retire!

    _Abbot_.              And I reply--
    Never--till I have battled with this fiend:--                       70
    What doth he here?

    _Man_.             Why--aye--what doth he here?
    I did not send for him,--he is unbidden.

    _Abbot_. Alas! lost Mortal! what with guests like these
    Hast thou to do? I tremble for thy sake:
    Why doth he gaze on thee, and thou on him?
    Ah! he unveils his aspect: on his brow
    The thunder-scars are graven; from his eye[169]
    Glares forth the immortality of Hell--
    Avaunt!--

    _Man_.        Pronounce--what is thy mission?

    _Spirit_.                                     Come!

    _Abbot_. What art thou, unknown being? answer!--speak!              80

    _Spirit_. The genius of this mortal.--Come!'tis time.

    _Man_. I am prepared for all things, but deny
    The Power which summons me. Who sent thee here?

    _Spirit_. Thou'lt know anon--Come! come!

    _Man_.                                  I have commanded
    Things of an essence greater far than thine,
    And striven with thy masters. Get thee hence!

    _Spirit_. Mortal! thine hour is come--Away! I say.

    _Man_. I knew, and know my hour is come, but not
    To render up my soul to such as thee:
    Away! I'll die as I have lived--alone.                              90

    _Spirit_. Then I must summon up my brethren.--Rise![bg]
                                                    [_Other Spirits rise._

    _Abbot_. Avaunt! ye evil ones!--Avaunt! I say,--
    Ye have no power where Piety hath power,
    And I do charge ye in the name--

    _Spirit_.                        Old man!
    We know ourselves, our mission, and thine order;
    Waste not thy holy words on idle uses,
    It were in vain: this man is forfeited.
    Once more--I summon him--Away! Away!

    _Man_. I do defy ye,--though I feel my soul
    Is ebbing from me, yet I do defy ye;                               100
    Nor will I hence, while I have earthly breath
    To breathe my scorn upon ye--earthly strength
    To wrestle, though with spirits; what ye take
    Shall be ta'en limb by limb.

    _Spirit_.                    Reluctant mortal!
    Is this the Magian who would so pervade
    The world invisible, and make himself
    Almost our equal? Can it be that thou
    Art thus in love with life? the very life
    Which made thee wretched?

    _Man_.                   Thou false fiend, thou liest!
    My life is in its last hour,--_that_ I know,                       110
    Nor would redeem a moment of that hour;
    I do not combat against Death, but thee
    And thy surrounding angels; my past power
    Was purchased by no compact with thy crew,
    But by superior science--penance, daring,
    And length of watching, strength of mind, and skill
    In knowledge of our Fathers--when the earth
    Saw men and spirits walking side by side,
    And gave ye no supremacy: I stand
    Upon my strength--I do defy--deny--                                120
    Spurn back, and scorn ye!--

    _Spirit_.                 But thy many crimes
    Have made thee--

    _Man_.          What are they to such as thee?
    Must crimes be punished but by other crimes,
    And greater criminals?--Back to thy hell!
    Thou hast no power upon me, _that_ I feel;
    Thou never shalt possess me, _that_ I know:
    What I have done is done; I bear within
    A torture which could nothing gain from thine:
    The Mind which is immortal makes itself
    Requital for its good or evil thoughts,--                          130
    Is its own origin of ill and end--
    And its own place and time:[170] its innate sense,
    When stripped of this mortality, derives
    No colour from the fleeting things without,
    But is absorbed in sufferance or in joy,
    Born from the knowledge of its own desert.
    _Thou_ didst not tempt me, and thou couldst not tempt me;
    I have not been thy dupe, nor am thy prey--
    But was my own destroyer, and will be
    My own hereafter.--Back, ye baffled fiends!                        140
    The hand of Death is on me--but not yours!
                                                  [_The Demons disappear._

    _Abbot_. Alas! how pale thou art--thy lips are white--
    And thy breast heaves--and in thy gasping throat
    The accents rattle: Give thy prayers to Heaven--
    Pray--albeit but in thought,--but die not thus.

    _Man_. 'Tis over--my dull eyes can fix thee not;
    But all things swim around me, and the earth
    Heaves as it were beneath me. Fare thee well--
    Give me thy hand.

    _Abbot_.            Cold--cold--even to the heart--
    But yet one prayer--Alas! how fares it with thee?                  150

    _Man_. Old man! 'tis not so difficult to die.[171]
                                                       [MANFRED _expires._

    _Abbot_. He's gone--his soul hath ta'en its earthless flight;
    Whither? I dread to think--but he is gone.[172]

                        THE LAMENT OF TASSO.[175]

                        I.

    Long years!--It tries the thrilling frame to bear
    And eagle-spirit of a Child of Song--
    Long years of outrage--calumny--and wrong;
    Imputed madness, prisoned solitude,[176]
    And the Mind's canker in its savage mood,
    When the impatient thirst of light and air
    Parches the heart; and the abhorred grate,
    Marring the sunbeams with its hideous shade,
    Works through the throbbing eyeball to the brain,
    With a hot sense of heaviness and pain;                             10
    And bare, at once, Captivity displayed
    Stands scoffing through the never-opened gate,
    Which nothing through its bars admits, save day,
    And tasteless food, which I have eat alone
    Till its unsocial bitterness is gone;
    And I can banquet like a beast of prey,
    Sullen and lonely, couching in the cave
    Which is my lair, and--it may be--my grave.
    All this hath somewhat worn me, and may wear,
    But must be borne. I stoop not to despair;                          20
    For I have battled with mine agony,
    And made me wings wherewith to overfly
    The narrow circus of my dungeon wall,
    And freed the Holy Sepulchre from thrall;
    And revelled among men and things divine,
    And poured my spirit over Palestine,[177]
    In honour of the sacred war for Him,
    The God who was on earth and is in Heaven,
    For He has strengthened me in heart and limb.
    That through this sufferance I might be forgiven,                   30
    I have employed my penance to record
    How Salem's shrine was won, and how adored.

                        II.

    But this is o'er--my pleasant task is done:--[178]
    My long-sustaining Friend of many years!
    If I do blot thy final page with tears,[179]
    Know, that my sorrows have wrung from me none.
    But Thou, my young creation! my Soul's child!
    Which ever playing round me came and smiled,
    And wooed me from myself with thy sweet sight,
    Thou too art gone--and so is my delight:                            40
    And therefore do I weep and inly bleed
    With this last bruise upon a broken reed.
    Thou too art ended--what is left me now?
    For I have anguish yet to bear--and how?
    I know not that--but in the innate force
    Of my own spirit shall be found resource.
    I have not sunk, for I had no remorse,
    Nor cause for such: they called me mad--and why?
    Oh Leonora! wilt not thou reply?[180]
    I was indeed delirious in my heart                                  50
    To lift my love so lofty as thou art;
    But still my frenzy was not of the mind:
    I knew my fault, and feel my punishment
    Not less because I suffer it unbent.
    That thou wert beautiful, and I not blind,
    Hath been the sin which shuts me from mankind;
    But let them go, or torture as they will,
    My heart can multiply thine image still;
    Successful Love may sate itself away;
    The wretched are the faithful; 't is their fate                     60
    To have all feeling, save the one, decay,
    And every passion into one dilate,
    As rapid rivers into Ocean pour;
    But ours is fathomless, and hath no shore.

                        III.

    Above me, hark! the long and maniac cry
    Of minds and bodies in captivity.
    And hark! the lash and the increasing howl,
    And the half-inarticulate blasphemy!
    There be some here with worse than frenzy foul,
    Some who do still goad on the o'er-laboured mind,                   70
    And dim the little light that's left behind
    With needless torture, as their tyrant Will
    Is wound up to the lust of doing ill:[181]
    With these and with their victims am I classed,
    'Mid sounds and sights like these long years have passed;
    'Mid sights and sounds like these my life may close:
    So let it be--for then I shall repose.

                        IV.

    I have been patient, let me be so yet;
    I had forgotten half I would forget,
    But it revives--Oh! would it were my lot                            80
    To be forgetful as I am forgot!--
    Feel I not wroth with those who bade me dwell
    In this vast Lazar-house of many woes?
    Where laughter is not mirth, nor thought the mind,
    Nor words a language, nor ev'n men mankind;
    Where cries reply to curses, shrieks to blows,
    And each is tortured in his separate hell--
    For we are crowded in our solitudes--
    Many, but each divided by the wall,
    Which echoes Madness in her babbling moods;                         90
    While all can hear, none heed his neighbour's call--
    None! save that One, the veriest wretch of all,
    Who was not made to be the mate of these,
    Nor bound between Distraction and Disease.
    Feel I not wroth with those who placed me here?
    Who have debased me in the minds of men,
    Debarring me the usage of my own,
    Blighting my life in best of its career,
    Branding my thoughts as things to shun and fear?
    Would I not pay them back these pangs again,                       100
    And teach them inward Sorrow's stifled groan?
    The struggle to be calm, and cold distress,
    Which undermines our Stoical success?
    No!--still too proud to be vindictive--I
    Have pardoned Princes' insults, and would die.
    Yes, Sister of my Sovereign! for thy sake
    I weed all bitterness from out my breast,
    It hath no business where _thou_ art a guest:
    Thy brother hates--but I can not detest;
    Thou pitiest not--but I can not forsake.                           110

                        V.

    Look on a love which knows not to despair,
    But all unquenched is still my better part,
    Dwelling deep in my shut and silent heart,
    As dwells the gathered lightning in its cloud,
    Encompassed with its dark and rolling shroud,
    Till struck,--forth flies the all-ethereal dart!
    And thus at the collision of thy name
    The vivid thought still flashes through my frame,
    And for a moment all things as they were
    Flit by me;--they are gone--I am the same.                         120
    And yet my love without ambition grew;
    I knew thy state--my station--and I knew
    A Princess was no love-mate for a bard;[182]
    I told it not--I breathed it not[183]--it was
    Sufficient to itself, its own reward;
    And if my eyes revealed it, they, alas!
    Were punished by the silentness of thine,
    And yet I did not venture to repine.
    Thou wert to me a crystal-girded shrine,
    Worshipped at holy distance, and around                            130
    Hallowed and meekly kissed the saintly ground;
    Not for thou wert a Princess, but that Love
    Had robed thee with a glory, and arrayed
    Thy lineaments in beauty that dismayed--
    Oh! not dismayed--but awed, like One above!
    And in that sweet severity[184] there was
    A something which all softness did surpass--
    I know not how--thy Genius mastered mine--
    My Star stood still before thee:--if it were
    Presumptuous thus to love without design,                          140
    That sad fatality hath cost me dear;
    But thou art dearest still, and I should be
    Fit for this cell, which wrongs me--but for _thee_.
    The very love which locked me to my chain
    Hath lightened half its weight; and for the rest,
    Though heavy, lent me vigour to sustain,
    And look to thee with undivided breast,
    And foil the ingenuity of Pain.

                        VI.

    It is no marvel--from my very birth
    My soul was drunk with Love,--which did pervade                    150
    And mingle with whate'er I saw on earth:
    Of objects all inanimate I made
    Idols, and out of wild and lonely flowers,
    And rocks, whereby they grew, a Paradise,
    Where I did lay me down within the shade
    Of waving trees, and dreamed uncounted hours,
    Though I was chid for wandering; and the Wise
    Shook their white aged heads o'er me, and said
    Of such materials wretched men were made,
    And such a truant boy would end in woe,                            160
    And that the only lesson was a blow;[185]--
    And then they smote me, and I did not weep,
    But cursed them in my heart, and to my haunt
    Returned and wept alone, and dreamed again
    The visions which arise without a sleep.
    And with my years my soul began to pant
    With feelings of strange tumult and soft pain;
    And the whole heart exhaled into One Want,
    But undefined and wandering, till the day
    I found the thing I sought--and that was thee;                     170
    And then I lost my being, all to be
    Absorbed in thine;--the world was past away;--
    _Thou_ didst annihilate the earth to me!


                        VII.

    I loved all Solitude--but little thought
    To spend I know not what of life, remote
    From all communion with existence, save
    The maniac and his tyrant;--had I been
    Their fellow, many years ere this had seen
    My mind like theirs corrupted to its grave.[bh]
    But who hath seen me writhe, or heard me rave?                     180
    Perchance in such a cell we suffer more
    Than the wrecked sailor on his desert shore;
    The world is all before him--_mine_ is _here_,
    Scarce twice the space they must accord my bier.
    What though _he_ perish, he may lift his eye,
    And with a dying glance upbraid the sky;
    I will not raise my own in such reproof,
    Although 'tis clouded by my dungeon roof.

                        VIII.

    Yet do I feel at times my mind decline,[186]
    But with a sense of its decay: I see                               190
    Unwonted lights along my prison shine,
    And a strange Demon,[187] who is vexing me
    With pilfering pranks and petty pains, below
    The feeling of the healthful and the free;
    But much to One, who long hath suffered so,
    Sickness of heart, and narrowness of place,
    And all that may be borne, or can debase.
    I thought mine enemies had been but Man,
    But Spirits may be leagued with them--all Earth
    Abandons--Heaven forgets me;--in the dearth                        200
    Of such defence the Powers of Evil can--
    It may be--tempt me further,--and prevail
    Against the outworn creature they assail.
    Why in this furnace is my spirit proved,
    Like steel in tempering fire? because I loved?
    Because I loved what not to love, and see,
    Was more or less than mortal, and than me.

                        IX.

    I once was quick in feeling--that is o'er;--
    My scars are callous, or I should have dashed
    My brain against these bars, as the sun flashed                    210
    In mockery through them;--- If I bear and bore
    The much I have recounted, and the more
    Which hath no words,--'t is that I would not die
    And sanction with self-slaughter the dull lie
    Which snared me here, and with the brand of shame
    Stamp Madness deep into my memory,
    And woo Compassion to a blighted name,
    Sealing the sentence which my foes proclaim.
    No--it shall be immortal!--and I make
    A future temple of my present cell,                                220
    Which nations yet shall visit for my sake.[bi]
    While thou, Ferrara! when no longer dwell
    The ducal chiefs within thee, shall fall down,
    And crumbling piecemeal view thy hearthless halls,
    A Poet's wreath shall be thine only crown,--
    A Poet's dungeon thy most far renown,
    While strangers wonder o'er thy unpeopled walls!
    And thou, Leonora!--thou--who wert ashamed
    That such as I could love--who blushed to hear
    To less than monarchs that thou couldst be dear,                   230
    Go! tell thy brother, that my heart, untamed
    By grief--years--weariness--and it may be
    A taint of that he would impute to me--
    From long infection of a den like this,
    Where the mind rots congenial with the abyss,--
    Adores thee still;--and add--that when the towers
    And battlements which guard his joyous hours
    Of banquet, dance, and revel, are forgot,
    Or left untended in a dull repose,
    This--this--shall be a consecrated spot!                           240
    But _Thou_--when all that Birth and Beauty throws
    Of magic round thee is extinct--shalt have
    One half the laurel which o'ershades my grave.[188]
    No power in death can tear our names apart,
    As none in life could rend thee from my heart.[bj]
    Yes, Leonora! it shall be our fate
    To be entwined[189] for ever--but too late![190]

                               BEPPO.[194]

                        I.

    'Tis known, at least it should be, that throughout
      All countries of the Catholic persuasion,[195]
    Some weeks before Shrove Tuesday comes about,
      The People take their fill of recreation,
    And buy repentance, ere they grow devout,
      However high their rank, or low their station,
    With fiddling, feasting, dancing, drinking, masquing,
    And other things which may be had for asking.

                        II.

    The moment night with dusky mantle covers
      The skies (and the more duskily the better),
    The Time less liked by husbands than by lovers
      Begins, and Prudery flings aside her fetter;
    And Gaiety on restless tiptoe hovers,
      Giggling with all the gallants who beset her;
    And there are songs and quavers, roaring, humming,
    Guitars, and every other sort of strumming.[196]


                        III.

    And there are dresses splendid, but fantastical,
      Masks of all times and nations, Turks and Jews,
    And harlequins and clowns, with feats gymnastical,
      Greeks, Romans, Yankee-doodles, and Hindoos;
    All kinds of dress, except the ecclesiastical,
      All people, as their fancies hit, may choose,
    But no one in these parts may quiz the Clergy,--
    Therefore take heed, ye Freethinkers! I charge ye.

                        IV.

    You'd better walk about begirt with briars,
      Instead of coat and smallclothes, than put on
    A single stitch reflecting upon friars,
      Although you swore it only was in fun;
    They'd haul you o'er the coals, and stir the fires
      Of Phlegethon with every mother's son,
    Nor say one mass to cool the cauldron's bubble
    That boiled your bones, unless you paid them double.

                        V.

    But saving this, you may put on whate'er
      You like by way of doublet, cape, or cloak,
    Such as in Monmouth-street, or in Rag Fair,
      Would rig you out in seriousness or joke;
    And even in Italy such places are,
      With prettier name in softer accents spoke,
    For, bating Covent Garden, I can hit on
    No place that's called "Piazza" in Great Britain.[197]



                        VI.

    This feast is named the Carnival, which being
      Interpreted, implies "farewell to flesh:"
    So called, because the name and thing agreeing,
      Through Lent they live on fish both salt and fresh.
    But why they usher Lent with so much glee in,
      Is more than I can tell, although I guess
    'Tis as we take a glass with friends at parting,
    In the Stage-Coach or Packet, just at starting.

                        VII.

    And thus they bid farewell to carnal dishes,
      And solid meats, and highly spiced ragouts,
    To live for forty days on ill-dressed fishes,
      Because they have no sauces to their stews;
    A thing which causes many "poohs" and "pishes,"
      And several oaths (which would not suit the Muse),
    From travellers accustomed from a boy
    To eat their salmon, at the least, with soy;

                        VIII.

    And therefore humbly I would recommend
      "The curious in fish-sauce," before they cross
    The sea, to bid their cook, or wife, or friend,
       Walk or ride to the Strand, and buy in gross
    (Or if set out beforehand, these may send
       By any means least liable to loss),
    Ketchup, Soy, Chili-vinegar, and Harvey,
    Or, by the Lord! a Lent will well nigh starve ye;

                        IX.

    That is to say, if your religion's Roman,
      And you at Rome would do as Romans do,
    According to the proverb,--although no man,
      If foreign, is obliged to fast; and you,
    If Protestant, or sickly, or a woman,
      Would rather dine in sin on a ragout--
    Dine and be d--d! I don't mean to be coarse,
    But that's the penalty, to say no worse.

                        X.

    Of all the places where the Carnival
      Was most facetious in the days of yore,
    For dance, and song, and serenade, and ball,
      And Masque, and Mime, and Mystery, and more
    Than I have time to tell now, or at all,
      Venice the bell from every city bore,--
    And at the moment when I fix my story,
    That sea-born city was in all her glory.

                        XI.

    They've pretty faces yet, those same Venetians,
      Black eyes, arched brows, and sweet expressions still;
    Such as of old were copied from the Grecians,
      In ancient arts by moderns mimicked ill;
    And like so many Venuses of Titian's[198]
      (The best's at Florence--see it, if ye will,)
    They look when leaning over the balcony,
    Or stepped from out a picture by Giorgione,[199]

                        XII.

    Whose tints are Truth and Beauty at their best;
      And when you to Manfrini's palace go,[200]
    That picture (howsoever fine the rest)
      Is loveliest to my mind of all the show;
    It may perhaps be also to _your_ zest,
      And that's the cause I rhyme upon it so:
    Tis but a portrait of his Son, and Wife,
    And self; but _such_ a Woman! Love in life![201]

                        XIII.

    Love in full life and length, not love ideal,
      No, nor ideal beauty, that fine name,
    But something better still, so very real,
      That the sweet Model must have been the same;
    A thing that you would purchase, beg, or steal,
      Wer't not impossible, besides a shame:
    The face recalls some face, as 'twere with pain,
    You once have seen, but ne'er will see again;

                        XIV.

    One of those forms which flit by us, when we
      Are young, and fix our eyes on every face;
    And, oh! the Loveliness at times we see
      In momentary gliding, the soft grace,
    The Youth, the Bloom, the Beauty which agree,
      In many a nameless being we retrace,
    Whose course and home we knew not, nor shall know,
    Like the lost Pleiad[202] seen no more below.

                        XV.

    I said that like a picture by Giorgione
      Venetian women were, and so they _are_,
    Particularly seen from a balcony,
      (For beauty's sometimes best set off afar)
    And there, just like a heroine of Goldoni,[202A]
      They peep from out the blind, or o'er the bar;
    And truth to say, they're mostly very pretty,
    And rather like to show it, more's the pity!

                        XVI.

    For glances beget ogles, ogles sighs,
      Sighs wishes, wishes words, and words a letter,
    Which flies on wings of light-heeled Mercuries,
      Who do such things because they know no better;
    And then, God knows what mischief may arise,
      When Love links two young people in one fetter,
    Vile assignations, and adulterous beds,
    Elopements, broken vows, and hearts, and heads.

                        XVII.

    Shakspeare described the sex in Desdemona
      As very fair, but yet suspect in fame,[202B]
    And to this day from Venice to Verona
      Such matters may be probably the same,
    Except that since those times was never known a
      Husband whom mere suspicion could inflame
    To suffocate a wife no more than twenty,
    Because she had a "Cavalier Servente."[203]

                        XVIII.

    Their jealousy (if they are ever jealous)
      Is of a fair complexion altogether,
    Not like that sooty devil of Othello's,
      Which smothers women in a bed of feather,
    But worthier of these much more jolly fellows,
      When weary of the matrimonial tether
    His head for such a wife no mortal bothers,
    But takes at once another, or _another's_.

                        XIX.

    Didst ever see a Gondola? For fear
      You should not, I'll describe it you exactly:
    'Tis a long covered boat that's common here,
      Carved at the prow, built lightly, but compactly,
    Rowed by two rowers, each call'd "Gondolier,"
      It glides along the water looking blackly,
    Just like a coffin clapt in a canoe,
    Where none can make out what you say or do.

                        XX.

    And up and down the long canals they go,
      And under the Rialto[204] shoot along,
    By night and day, all paces, swift or slow,
      And round the theatres, a sable throng,
    They wait in their dusk livery of woe,--
      But not to them do woeful things belong,
    For sometimes they contain a deal of fun,
    Like mourning coaches when the funeral's done.

                        XXI.

    But to my story.--'Twas some years ago,
      It may be thirty, forty, more or less,
    The Carnival was at its height, and so
      Were all kinds of buffoonery and dress;
    A certain lady went to see the show,
      Her real name I know not, nor can guess,
    And so we'll call her Laura, if you please,
    Because it slips into my verse with ease.

                        XXII.

    She was not old, nor young, nor at the years
      Which certain people call a "_certain age_,"[205]
    Which yet the most uncertain age appears,
      Because I never heard, nor could engage
    A person yet by prayers, or bribes, or tears,
      To name, define by speech, or write on page,
    The period meant precisely by that word,--
    Which surely is exceedingly absurd.

                        XXIII.

    Laura was blooming still, had made the best
      Of Time, and Time returned the compliment,
    And treated her genteelly, so that, dressed,
      She looked extremely well where'er she went;
    A pretty woman is a welcome guest,
      And Laura's brow a frown had rarely bent;
    Indeed, she shone all smiles, and seemed to flatter
    Mankind with her black eyes for looking at her.

                        XXIV.

    She was a married woman; 'tis convenient,
      Because in Christian countries 'tis a rule
    To view their little slips with eyes more lenient;
      Whereas if single ladies play the fool,
    (Unless within the period intervenient
      A well-timed wedding makes the scandal cool)
    I don't know how they ever can get over it,
    Except they manage never to discover it.

                        XXV.

    Her husband sailed upon the Adriatic,
      And made some voyages, too, in other seas,
    And when he lay in Quarantine for pratique[206]
      (A forty days' precaution 'gainst disease),
    His wife would mount, at times, her highest attic,
      For thence she could discern the ship with ease:
    He was a merchant trading to Aleppo,
    His name Giuseppe, called more briefly, Beppo.[207]

                        XXVI.

    He was a man as dusky as a Spaniard,
      Sunburnt with travel, yet a portly figure;
    Though coloured, as it were, within a tanyard,
      He was a person both of sense and vigour--
    A better seaman never yet did man yard;
      And she, although her manners showed no rigour,
    Was deemed a woman of the strictest principle,
    So much as to be thought almost invincible.[208]

                        XXVII.

    But several years elapsed since they had met;
      Some people thought the ship was lost, and some
    That he had somehow blundered into debt,
      And did not like the thought of steering home;
    And there were several offered any bet,
      Or that he would, or that he would not come;
    For most men (till by losing rendered sager)
    Will back their own opinions with a wager.

                        XXVIII.

    'Tis said that their last parting was pathetic,
      As partings often are, or ought to be,
    And their presentiment was quite prophetic,
      That they should never more each other see,
    (A sort of morbid feeling, half poetic,
      Which I have known occur in two or three,)
    When kneeling on the shore upon her sad knee
    He left this Adriatic Ariadne.

                        XXIX.

    And Laura waited long, and wept a little,
      And thought of wearing weeds, as well she might;
    She almost lost all appetite for victual,
      And could not sleep with ease alone at night;
    She deemed the window-frames and shutters brittle
      Against a daring housebreaker or sprite,
    And so she thought it prudent to connect her
    With a vice-husband, _chiefly_ to _protect her_.

                        XXX.

    She chose, (and what is there they will not choose,
      If only you will but oppose their choice?)
    Till Beppo should return from his long cruise,
      And bid once more her faithful heart rejoice,
    A man some women like, and yet abuse--
      A Coxcomb was he by the public voice;
    A Count of wealth, they said as well as quality,
    And in his pleasures of great liberality.[bk]

                        XXXI.

    And then he was a Count, and then he knew
      Music, and dancing, fiddling, French and Tuscan;
    The last not easy, be it known to you,
      For few Italians speak the right Etruscan.
    He was a critic upon operas, too,
      And knew all niceties of sock and buskin;
    And no Venetian audience could endure a
    Song, scene, or air, when he cried "seccatura!"[209]

                        XXXII.

    His "bravo" was decisive, for that sound
      Hushed "Academie" sighed in silent awe;
    The fiddlers trembled as he looked around,
      For fear of some false note's detected flaw;
    The "Prima Donna's" tuneful heart would bound,
      Dreading the deep damnation of his "Bah!"
    Soprano, Basso, even the Contra-Alto,
    Wished him five fathom under the Rialto.

                        XXXIII.

    He patronised the Improvisatori,
      Nay, could himself extemporise some stanzas,
    Wrote rhymes, sang songs, could also tell a story,
      Sold pictures, and was skilful in the dance as
    Italians can be, though in this their glory
      Must surely yield the palm to that which France has;
    In short, he was a perfect Cavaliero,
    And to his very valet seemed a hero.[210]

                        XXXIV.

    Then he was faithful too, as well as amorous;
      So that no sort of female could complain,
    Although they're now and then a little clamorous,
      He never put the pretty souls in pain;
    His heart was one of those which most enamour us,
      Wax to receive, and marble to retain:
    He was a lover of the good old school,
    Who still become more constant as they cool.

                        XXXV.

    No wonder such accomplishments should turn
      A female head, however sage and steady--
    With scarce a hope that Beppo could return,
      In law he was almost as good as dead, he
    Nor sent, nor wrote, nor showed the least concern,
      And she had waited several years already:
    And really if a man won't let us know
    That he's alive, he's _dead_--or should be so.

                        XXXVI.

    Besides, within the Alps, to every woman,
      (Although, God knows, it is a grievous sin,)
    'Tis, I may say, permitted to have _two_ men;
      I can't tell who first brought the custom in,
    But "Cavalier Serventes" are quite common,
      And no one notices or cares a pin;
    An we may call this (not to say the worst)
    A _second_ marriage which corrupts the _first_.

                        XXXVII.

    The word was formerly a "Cicisbeo,"[211]
      But _that_ is now grown vulgar and indecent;
    The Spaniards call the person a "_Cortejo_,"[212]
      For the same mode subsists in Spain, though recent;
    In short it reaches from the Po to Teio,
      And may perhaps at last be o'er the sea sent:
    But Heaven preserve Old England from such courses!
    Or what becomes of damage and divorces?

                        XXXVIII.[213]

    However, I still think, with all due deference
      To the fair _single_ part of the creation,
    That married ladies should preserve the preference
      In _tete a tete_ or general conversation--
    And this I say without peculiar reference
      To England, France, or any other nation--
    Because they know the world, and are at ease,
    And being natural, naturally please.

                        XXXIX.

    'Tis true, your budding Miss is very charming,
      But shy and awkward at first coming out,
    So much alarmed, that she is quite alarming,
      All Giggle, Blush; half Pertness, and half Pout;
    And glancing at _Mamma_, for fear there's harm in
      What you, she, it, or they, may be about:
    The Nursery still lisps out in all they utter--
    Besides, they always smell of bread and butter.[214]

                        XL.

    But "Cavalier Servente" is the phrase
      Used in politest circles to express
    This supernumerary slave, who stays
      Close to the lady as a part of dress,
    Her word the only law which he obeys.
      His is no sinecure, as you may guess;
    Coach, servants, gondola, he goes to call,
    And carries fan and tippet, gloves and shawl.

                        XLI.

    With all its sinful doings, I must say,
      That Italy's a pleasant place to me,
    Who love to see the Sun shine every day,
      And vines (not nailed to walls) from tree to tree
    Festooned, much like the back scene of a play,
      Or melodrame, which people flock to see,
    When the first act is ended by a dance
    In vineyards copied from the South of France.

                        XLII.

    I like on Autumn evenings to ride out,
      Without being forced to bid my groom be sure
    My cloak is round his middle strapped about,
      Because the skies are not the most secure;
    I know too that, if stopped upon my route,
      Where the green alleys windingly allure,
    Reeling with _grapes_ red wagons choke the way,--
    In England 'twould be dung, dust, or a dray.

                        XLIII.

    I also like to dine on becaficas,
      To see the Sun set, sure he'll rise to-morrow,
    Not through a misty morning twinkling weak as
      A drunken man's dead eye in maudlin sorrow,
    But with all Heaven t'himself; the day will break as
      Beauteous as cloudless, nor be forced to borrow
    That sort of farthing candlelight which glimmers
    Where reeking London's smoky cauldron simmers.

                        XLIV.

    I love the language, that soft bastard Latin,[215]
      Which melts like kisses from a female mouth,
    And sounds as if it should be writ on satin,[216]
      With syllables which breathe of the sweet South,
    And gentle liquids gliding all so pat in,
      That not a single accent seems uncouth,
    Like our harsh northern whistling, grunting guttural,
    Which we're obliged to hiss, and spit, and sputter all.

                        XLV.

    I like the women too (forgive my folly!),
      From the rich peasant cheek of ruddy bronze,[bl]
    And large black eyes that flash on you a volley
      Of rays that say a thousand things at once,
    To the high Dama's brow, more melancholy,
      But clear, and with a wild and liquid glance,
    Heart on her lips, and soul within her eyes,
    Soft as her clime, and sunny as her skies.[bm]

                        XLVI.

    Eve of the land which still is Paradise!
      Italian Beauty didst thou not inspire
    Raphael,[217] who died in thy embrace, and vies
      With all we know of Heaven, or can desire,
    In what he hath bequeathed us?--in what guise,
      Though flashing from the fervour of the Lyre,
    Would _words_ describe thy past and present glow,
    While yet Canova[218] can create below?[219]

                        XLVII.

    "England! with all thy faults I love thee still,"[220]
      I said at Calais, and have not forgot it;
    I like to speak and lucubrate my fill;
      I like the government (but that is not it);
    I like the freedom of the press and quill;
      I like the Habeas Corpus (when we've got it);
    I like a Parliamentary debate,
    Particularly when 'tis not too late;

                        XLVIII.

    I like the taxes, when they're not too many;
      I like a seacoal fire, when not too dear;
    I like a beef-steak, too, as well as any;
      Have no objection to a pot of beer;
    I like the weather,--when it is not rainy,
      That is, I like two months of every year.
    And so God save the Regent, Church, and King!
    Which means that I like all and every thing.

                        XLIX.

    Our standing army, and disbanded seamen,
      Poor's rate, Reform, my own, the nation's debt,
    Our little riots just to show we're free men,
      Our trifling bankruptcies in the Gazette,
    Our cloudy climate, and our chilly women,
      All these I can forgive, and those forget,
    And greatly venerate our recent glories,
    And wish they were not owing to the Tories.

                        L.

    But to my tale of Laura,--for I find
      Digression is a sin, that by degrees
    Becomes exceeding tedious to my mind,
      And, therefore, may the reader too displease--
    The gentle reader, who may wax unkind,
      And caring little for the Author's ease,
    Insist on knowing what he means--a hard
    And hapless situation for a Bard.

                        LI.

    Oh! that I had the art of easy writing
      What should be easy reading! could I scale
    Parnassus, where the Muses sit inditing
      Those pretty poems never known to fail,
    How quickly would I print (the world delighting)
      A Grecian, Syrian,[221] or _Ass_yrian tale;
    And sell you, mixed with western Sentimentalism,
    Some samples of the _finest Orientalism._

                        LII.

    But I am but a nameless sort of person,
      (A broken Dandy[222] lately on my travels)
    And take for rhyme, to hook my rambling verse on,
      The first that Walker's Lexicon unravels,
    And when I can't find that, I put a worse on,
      Not caring as I ought for critics' cavils;
    I've half a mind to tumble down to prose,
    But verse is more in fashion--so here goes!

                        LIII.

    The Count and Laura made their new arrangement,
      Which lasted, as arrangements sometimes do,
    For half a dozen years without estrangement;
      They had their little differences, too;
    Those jealous whiffs, which never any change meant;
      In such affairs there probably are few
    Who have not had this pouting sort of squabble,
    From sinners of high station to the rabble.

                        LIV.

    But, on the whole, they were a happy pair,
      As happy as unlawful love could make them;
    The gentleman was fond, the lady fair,
      Their chains so slight, 'twas not worth while to break them:
    The World beheld them with indulgent air;
      The pious only wished "the Devil take them!"
    He took them not; he very often waits,
    And leaves old sinners to be young ones' baits.

                        LV.

    But they were young: Oh! what without our Youth
      Would Love be! What would Youth be without Love!
    Youth lends its joy, and sweetness, vigour, truth,
      Heart, soul, and all that seems as from above;
    But, languishing with years, it grows uncouth--
      One of few things Experience don't improve;
    Which is, perhaps, the reason why old fellows
    Are always so preposterously jealous.

                        LVI.

    It was the Carnival, as I have said
      Some six and thirty stanzas back, and so
    Laura the usual preparations made,
      Which you do when your mind's made up to go
    To-night to Mrs. Boehm's masquerade,[223]
      Spectator, or Partaker in the show;
    The only difference known between the cases
    Is--_here_, we have six weeks of "varnished faces."


                        LVII.

    Laura, when dressed, was (as I sang before)
      A pretty woman as was ever seen,
    Fresh as the Angel o'er a new inn door,
      Or frontispiece of a new Magazine,[224]
    With all the fashions which the last month wore,
      Coloured, and silver paper leaved between
    That and the title-page, for fear the Press
    Should soil with parts of speech the parts of dress.

                        LVIII.

    They went to the Ridotto;[225] 'tis a hall
      Where People dance, and sup, and dance again;
    Its proper name, perhaps, were a masqued ball,
      But that's of no importance to my strain;
    'Tis (on a smaller scale) like our Vauxhall,
      Excepting that it can't be spoilt by rain;
    The company is "mixed" (the phrase I quote is
    As much as saying, they're below your notice);

                        LIX.

    For a "mixed company" implies that, save
      Yourself and friends, and half a hundred more,
    Whom you may bow to without looking grave,
      The rest are but a vulgar set, the Bore
    Of public places, where they basely brave
      The fashionable stare of twenty score
    Of well-bred persons, called "_The World_;" but I,
    Although I know them, really don't know why.

                        LX.

    This is the case in England; at least was
      During the dynasty of Dandies, now
    Perchance succeeded by some other class
      Of imitated Imitators:--how[bn]
    Irreparably soon decline, alas!
      The Demagogues of fashion: all below
    Is frail; how easily the world is lost
    By Love, or War, and, now and then,--by Frost!

                        LXI.

    Crushed was Napoleon by the northern Thor,
      Who knocked his army down with icy hammer,
    Stopped by the _Elements_[226]--like a Whaler--or
      A blundering novice in his new French grammar;
    Good cause had he to doubt the chance of war,
      And as for Fortune--but I dare not d--n her,
    Because, were I to ponder to Infinity,
    The more I should believe in her Divinity.[227]

                        LXII.

    She rules the present, past, and all to be yet,
      She gives us luck in lotteries, love, and marriage;
    I cannot say that she's done much for me yet;
      Not that I mean her bounties to disparage,
    We've not yet closed accounts, and we shall see yet
      How much she'll make amends for past miscarriage;
    Meantime the Goddess I'll no more importune,
    Unless to thank her when she's made my fortune.

                        LXIII.

    To turn,--and to return;--the Devil take it!
      This story slips for ever through my fingers,
    Because, just as the stanza likes to make it,
      It needs must be--and so it rather lingers;
    This form of verse began, I can't well break it,
      But must keep time and tune like public singers;
    But if I once get through my present measure,
    I'll take another when I'm next at leisure.

                        LXIV.

    They went to the Ridotto ('tis a place
      To which I mean to go myself to-morrow,[228]
    Just to divert my thoughts a little space
      Because I'm rather hippish, and may borrow
    Some spirits, guessing at what kind of face
      May lurk beneath each mask; and as my sorrow
    Slackens its pace sometimes, I'll make, or find,
    Something shall leave it half an hour behind.)

                        LXV.

    Now Laura moves along the joyous crowd,
      Smiles in her eyes, and simpers on her lips;
    To some she whispers, others speaks aloud;
      To some she curtsies, and to some she dips,
    Complains of warmth, and this complaint avowed,
      Her lover brings the lemonade, she sips;
    She then surveys, condemns, but pities still
    Her dearest friends for being dressed so ill.

                        LXVI.

    One has false curls, another too much paint,
      A third--where did she buy that frightful turban?
    A fourth's so pale she fears she's going to faint,
      A fifth's look's vulgar, dowdyish, and suburban,
    A sixth's white silk has got a yellow taint,
      A seventh's thin muslin surely will be her bane,
    And lo! an eighth appears,--"I'll see no more!"
    For fear, like Banquo's kings, they reach a score.

                        LXVII.

    Meantime, while she was thus at others gazing,
      Others were levelling their looks at her;
    She heard the men's half-whispered mode of praising
      And, till 'twas done, determined not to stir;
    The women only thought it quite amazing
      That, at her time of life, so many were
    Admirers still,--but "Men are so debased,
    Those brazen Creatures always suit their taste."

                        LXVIII.

    For my part, now, I ne'er could understand
      Why naughty women--but I won't discuss
    A thing which is a scandal to the land,
      I only don't see why it should be thus;
    And if I were but in a gown and band,
      Just to entitle me to make a fuss,
    I'd preach on this till Wilberforce and Romilly
    Should quote in their next speeches from my homily.

                        LXIX.

    While Laura thus was seen, and seeing, smiling,
      Talking, she knew not why, and cared not what,
    So that her female friends, with envy broiling,
      Beheld her airs, and triumph, and all that;
    And well-dressed males still kept before her filing,
      And passing bowed and mingled with her chat;
    More than the rest one person seemed to stare
    With pertinacity that's rather rare.

                        LXX.

    He was a Turk, the colour of mahogany;
      And Laura saw him, and at first was glad,
    Because the Turks so much admire philogyny,[bo]
      Although their usage of their wives is sad;
    'Tis said they use no better than a dog any
      Poor woman, whom they purchase like a pad:
    They have a number, though they ne'er exhibit 'em,
    Four wives by law, and concubines "ad libitum."

                        LXXI.

    They lock them up, and veil, and guard them daily,
      They scarcely can behold their male relations,
    So that their moments do not pass so gaily
      As is supposed the case with northern nations;
    Confinement, too, must make them look quite palely;
      And as the Turks abhor long conversations,
    Their days are either passed in doing nothing,
    Or bathing, nursing, making love, and clothing.

                        LXXII.

    They cannot read, and so don't lisp in criticism;
      Nor write, and so they don't affect the Muse;
    Were never caught in epigram or witticism,
      Have no romances, sermons, plays, reviews,--
    In Harams learning soon would make a pretty schism,
      But luckily these Beauties are no "Blues;"
    No bustling _Botherby_[229] have they to show 'em
    "That charming passage in the last new poem:"


                        LXXIII.

    No solemn, antique gentleman of rhyme,
      Who having angled all his life for Fame,
    And getting but a nibble at a time,
      Still fussily keeps fishing on, the same
    Small "Triton of the minnows," the sublime
      Of Mediocrity, the furious tame,
    The Echo's echo, usher of the school
    Of female wits, boy bards--in short, a fool!

                        LXXIV.

    A stalking oracle of awful phrase,
      The approving _"Good!"_ (by no means good in law)
    Humming like flies around the newest blaze,
      The bluest of bluebottles you e'er saw,
    Teasing with blame, excruciating with praise,
      Gorging the little fame he gets all raw,[bp]
    Translating tongues he knows not even by letter,
    And sweating plays so middling, bad were better.

                        LXXV.

    One hates an author that's _all author_--fellows
      In foolscap uniforms turned up with ink,
    So very anxious, clever, fine, and jealous,
      One don't know what to say to them, or think,
    Unless to puff them with a pair of bellows;
      Of Coxcombry's worst coxcombs e'en the pink
    Are preferable to these shreds of paper,
    These unquenched snuffings of the midnight taper.

                        LXXVI.

    Of these same we see several, and of others.
      Men of the world, who know the World like Men,
    Scott, Rogers, Moore, and all the better brothers,
      Who think of something else besides the pen;
    But for the children of the "Mighty Mother's,"
      The would-be wits, and can't-be gentlemen,
    I leave them to their daily "tea is ready,"[230]
    Smug coterie, and literary lady.

                        LXXVII.

    The poor dear Mussul_women_ whom I mention
      Have none of these instructive pleasant people,
    And _one_ would seem to them a new invention,
      Unknown as bells within a Turkish steeple;
    I think 'twould almost be worth while to pension
      (Though best-sown projects very often reap ill)
    A missionary author--just to preach
    Our Christian usage of the parts of speech.

                        LXXVIII.

    No Chemistry for them unfolds her gases,
      No Metaphysics are let loose in lectures,
    No Circulating Library amasses
      Religious novels, moral tales, and strictures
    Upon the living manners, as they pass us;
      No Exhibition glares with annual pictures;
    They stare not on the stars from out their attics,
    Nor deal (thank God for that!) in Mathematics.[231]

                        LXXIX.

    Why I thank God for that is no great matter,
      I have my reasons, you no doubt suppose,
    And as, perhaps, they would not highly flatter,
      I'll keep them for my life (to come) in prose;
    I fear I have a little turn for Satire,
      And yet methinks the older that one grows
    Inclines us more to laugh than scold, though Laughter
    Leaves us so doubly serious shortly after.

                        LXXX.[232]

    Oh, Mirth and Innocence! Oh, Milk and Water!
      Ye happy mixtures of more happy days!
    In these sad centuries of sin and slaughter,
      Abominable Man no more allays
    His thirst with such pure beverage. No matter,
      I love you both, and both shall have my praise:
    Oh, for old Saturn's reign of sugar-candy!---
    Meantime I drink to your return in brandy.

                        LXXXI.

    Our Laura's Turk still kept his eyes upon her,
      Less in the Mussulman than Christian way,
    Which seems to say, "Madam, I do you honour,
      And while I please to stare, you'll please to stay."
    Could staring win a woman, this had won her,
      But Laura could not thus be led astray;
    She had stood fire too long and well, to boggle
    Even at this Stranger's most outlandish ogle.

                        LXXXII.

    The morning now was on the point of breaking,
      A turn of time at which I would advise
    Ladies who have been dancing, or partaking
      In any other kind of exercise,
    To make their preparations for forsaking
      The ball-room ere the Sun begins to rise,
    Because when once the lamps and candles fail,
    His blushes make them look a little pale.

                        LXXXIII.

    I've seen some balls and revels in my time,
      And stayed them over for some silly reason,
    And then I looked (I hope it was no crime)
      To see what lady best stood out the season;
    And though I've seen some thousands in their prime
      Lovely and pleasing, and who still may please on,
    I never saw but one (the stars withdrawn)
    Whose bloom could after dancing dare the Dawn.

                        LXXXIV.

    The name of this Aurora I'll not mention,
      Although I might, for she was nought to me
    More than that patent work of God's invention,
      A charming woman, whom we like to see;
    But writing names would merit reprehension,
      Yet if you like to find out this fair _She,_
    At the next London or Parisian ball
    You still may mark her cheek, out-blooming all.

                        LXXXV.

    Laura, who knew it would not do at all
      To meet the daylight after seven hours' sitting
    Among three thousand people at a ball,
      To make her curtsey thought it right and fitting;
    The Count was at her elbow with her shawl,
      And they the room were on the point of quitting,
    When lo! those cursed Gondoliers had got
    Just in the very place where they _should not._

                        LXXXVI.

    In this they're like our coachmen, and the cause
      Is much the same--the crowd, and pulling, hauling,
    With blasphemies enough to break their jaws,
      They make a never intermitted bawling.
    At home, our Bow-street gem'men keep the laws,
      And here a sentry stands within your calling;
    But for all that, there is a deal of swearing,
    And nauseous words past mentioning or bearing.

                        LXXXVII.

    The Count and Laura found their boat at last,
      And homeward floated o'er the silent tide,
    Discussing all the dances gone and past;
      The dancers and their dresses, too, beside;
    Some little scandals eke; but all aghast
      (As to their palace-stairs the rowers glide)
    Sate Laura by the side of her adorer,[bq]
    When lo! the Mussulman was there before her!


                        LXXXVIII.

    "Sir," said the Count, with brow exceeding grave,
      "Your unexpected presence here will make
    It necessary for myself to crave
      Its import? But perhaps 'tis a mistake;
    I hope it is so; and, at once to waive
      All compliment, I hope so for _your_ sake;
    You understand my meaning, or you _shall._"
    "Sir," (quoth the Turk) "'tis no mistake at all:

                        LXXXIX.

    "That Lady is _my wife!_" Much wonder paints
      The lady's changing cheek, as well it might;
    But where an Englishwoman sometimes faints,
      Italian females don't do so outright;
    They only call a little on their Saints,
      And then come to themselves, almost, or quite;
    Which saves much hartshorn, salts, and sprinkling faces,
    And cutting stays, as usual in such cases.

                        XC.

    She said,--what could she say? Why, not a word;
      But the Count courteously invited in
    The Stranger, much appeased by what he heard:
      "Such things, perhaps, we'd best discuss within,"
    Said he; "don't let us make ourselves absurd
      In public, by a scene, nor raise a din,
    For then the chief and only satisfaction
    Will be much quizzing on the whole transaction."

                        XCI.

    They entered, and for Coffee called--it came,
      A beverage for Turks and Christians both,
    Although the way they make it's not the same.
      Now Laura, much recovered, or less loth
    To speak, cries "Beppo! what's your pagan name?
      Bless me! your beard is of amazing growth!
    And how came you to keep away so long?
    Are you not sensible 'twas very wrong?

                        XCII.

    "And are you _really, truly,_ now a Turk?
      With any other women did you wive?
    Is't true they use their fingers for a fork?
      Well, that's the prettiest Shawl--as I'm alive!
    You'll give it me? They say you eat no pork.
      And how so many years did you contrive
    To--Bless me! did I ever? No, I never
    Saw a man grown so yellow! How's your liver?

                        XCIII.

    "Beppo! that beard of yours becomes you not;
      It shall be shaved before you're a day older:
    Why do you wear it? Oh! I had forgot--
      Pray don't you think the weather here is colder?
    How do I look? You shan't stir from this spot
      In that queer dress, for fear that some beholder
    Should find you out, and make the story known.
    How short your hair is! Lord! how grey it's grown!"

                        XCIV.

    What answer Beppo made to these demands
      Is more than I know. He was cast away
    About where Troy stood once, and nothing stands;
      Became a slave of course, and for his pay
    Had bread and bastinadoes, till some bands
      Of pirates landing in a neighbouring bay,
    He joined the rogues and prospered, and became
    A renegade of indifferent fame.

                        XCV.

    But he grew rich, and with his riches grew so
      Keen the desire to see his home again,
    He thought himself in duty bound to do so,
      And not be always thieving on the main;
    Lonely he felt, at times, as Robin Crusoe,
      And so he hired a vessel come from Spain,
    Bound for Corfu: she was a fine polacca,
    Manned with twelve hands, and laden with tobacco.

                        XCVI.

    Himself, and much (heaven knows how gotten!) cash,
      He then embarked, with risk of life and limb,
    And got clear off, although the attempt was rash;
      _He_ said that _Providence_ protected him--
    For my part, I say nothing--lest we clash
      In our opinions:--well--the ship was trim,
    Set sail, and kept her reckoning fairly on,
    Except three days of calm when off Cape Bonn.[233]

                        XCVII.

    They reached the Island, he transferred his lading,
      And self and live stock to another bottom,
    And passed for a true Turkey-merchant, trading
      With goods of various names--but I've forgot 'em.
    However, he got off by this evading,
      Or else the people would perhaps have shot him;
    And thus at Venice landed to reclaim
    His wife, religion, house, and Christian name.

                        XCVIII.

    His wife received, the Patriarch re-baptised him,
      (He made the Church a present, by the way;)
    He then threw off the garments which disguised him,
      And borrowed the Count's smallclothes for a day:
    His friends the more for his long absence prized him,
      Finding he'd wherewithal to make them gay,
    With dinners, where he oft became the laugh of them,
    For stories--but _I_ don't believe the half of them.

                        XCIX.

    Whate'er his youth had suffered, his old age
      With wealth and talking made him some amends;
    Though Laura sometimes put him in a rage,
      I've heard the Count and he were always friends.
    My pen is at the bottom of a page,
      Which being finished, here the story ends:
    'Tis to be wished it had been sooner done,
    But stories somehow lengthen when begun.

      But every body knows the Regent's heart;
        I trust he won't reject a well-meant hint;
      Each Board to have twelve members, with a seat
        To bring them in per ann. five hundred neat:--

      "From Princes I descend to the Nobility:
        In former times all persons of high stations,
      Lords, Baronets, and Persons of gentility,
        Paid twenty guineas for the dedications;
      This practice was attended with utility;
        The patrons lived to future generations,
      The poets lived by their industrious earning,--
      So men alive and dead could live by Learning.

      "Then twenty guineas was a little fortune;
        Now, we must starve unless the times should mend:
      Our poets now-a-days are deemed importune
        If their addresses are diffusely penned;
      Most fashionable authors make a short one
        To their own wife, or child, or private friend,
      To show their independence, I suppose;
      And that may do for Gentlemen like those.

    "Lastly, the common people I beseech--
        Dear People! if you think my verses clever,
      Preserve with care your noble parts of speech,
        And take it as a maxim to endeavour
      To talk as your good mothers used to teach,
        And then these lines of mine may last for ever;
      And don't confound the language of the nation
      With long-tailed words in _osity_ and _ation_."


                            ODE ON VENICE[234]

                        I.

    Oh Venice! Venice! when thy marble walls
      Are level with the waters, there shall be
    A cry of nations o'er thy sunken halls,
      A loud lament along the sweeping sea!
    If I, a northern wanderer, weep for thee,
    What should thy sons do?--anything but weep:
    And yet they only murmur in their sleep.
    In contrast with their fathers--as the slime,
    The dull green ooze of the receding deep,
    Is with the dashing of the spring-tide foam,                        10
    That drives the sailor shipless to his home,
    Are they to those that were; and thus they creep,
    Crouching and crab-like, through their sapping streets.
    Oh! agony--that centuries should reap
    No mellower harvest! Thirteen hundred years[235]
    Of wealth and glory turned to dust and tears;
    And every monument the stranger meets,
    Church, palace, pillar, as a mourner greets;
    And even the Lion all subdued appears,[236]
    And the harsh sound of the barbarian drum,                          20
    With dull and daily dissonance, repeats
    The echo of thy Tyrant's voice along
    The soft waves, once all musical to song,
    That heaved beneath the moonlight with the throng
    Of gondolas[237]--and to the busy hum
    Of cheerful creatures, whose most sinful deeds
    Were but the overbeating of the heart,
    And flow of too much happiness, which needs
    The aid of age to turn its course apart
    From the luxuriant and voluptuous flood                             30
    Of sweet sensations, battling with the blood.
    But these are better than the gloomy errors,
    The weeds of nations in their last decay,
    When Vice walks forth with her unsoftened terrors,
    And Mirth is madness, and but smiles to slay;
    And Hope is nothing but a false delay,
    The sick man's lightning half an hour ere Death,
    When Faintness, the last mortal birth of Pain,
    And apathy of limb, the dull beginning
    Of the cold staggering race which Death is winning,                 40
    Steals vein by vein and pulse by pulse away;
    Yet so relieving the o'er-tortured clay,
    To him appears renewal of his breath,
    And freedom the mere numbness of his chain;
    And then he talks of Life, and how again
    He feels his spirit soaring--albeit weak,
    And of the fresher air, which he would seek;
    And as he whispers knows not that he gasps,
    That his thin finger feels not what it clasps,
    And so the film comes o'er him--and the dizzy                       50
    Chamber swims round and round--and shadows busy,
    At which he vainly catches, flit and gleam,
    Till the last rattle chokes the strangled scream,
    And all is ice and blackness,--and the earth
    That which it was the moment ere our birth.[238]

                        II.

    There is no hope for nations!--Search the page
      Of many thousand years--the daily scene,
    The flow and ebb of each recurring age,
      The everlasting _to be_ which _hath been_,
      Hath taught us nought or little: still we lean                    60
    On things that rot beneath our weight, and wear
    Our strength away in wrestling with the air;
    For't is our nature strikes us down: the beasts
    Slaughtered in hourly hecatombs for feasts
    Are of as high an order--they must go
    Even where their driver goads them, though to slaughter.
    Ye men, who pour your blood for kings as water,
    What have they given your children in return?
    A heritage of servitude and woes,
    A blindfold bondage, where your hire is blows.                      70
    What! do not yet the red-hot ploughshares burn,[239]
    O'er which you stumble in a false ordeal,
    And deem this proof of loyalty the _real_;
    Kissing the hand that guides you to your scars,
    And glorying as you tread the glowing bars?
    All that your Sires have left you, all that Time
    Bequeaths of free, and History of sublime,
    Spring from a different theme!--Ye see and read,
    Admire and sigh, and then succumb and bleed!
    Save the few spirits who, despite of all,                           80
    And worse than all, the sudden crimes engendered
    By the down-thundering of the prison-wall,
    And thirst to swallow the sweet waters tendered,
    Gushing from Freedom's fountains--when the crowd,[240]
    Maddened with centuries of drought, are loud,
    And trample on each other to obtain
    The cup which brings oblivion of a chain
    Heavy and sore,--in which long yoked they ploughed
    The sand,--or if there sprung the yellow grain,
    'Twas not for them, their necks were too much bowed,                90
    And their dead palates chewed the cud of pain:--
    Yes! the few spirits--who, despite of deeds
    Which they abhor, confound not with the cause
    Those momentary starts from Nature's laws,
    Which, like the pestilence and earthquake, smite
    But for a term, then pass, and leave the earth
    With all her seasons to repair the blight
    With a few summers, and again put forth
    Cities and generations--fair, when free--
    For, Tyranny, there blooms no bud for thee!                        100

                        III.

    Glory and Empire! once upon these towers[241]
      With Freedom--godlike Triad! how you sate!
    The league of mightiest nations, in those hours
      When Venice was an envy, might abate,
      But did not quench, her spirit--in her fate
    All were enwrapped: the feasted monarchs knew
      And loved their hostess, nor could learn to hate,
    Although they humbled--with the kingly few
    The many felt, for from all days and climes
    She was the voyager's worship;--even her crimes                    110
    Were of the softer order, born of Love--
    She drank no blood, nor fattened on the dead,
    But gladdened where her harmless conquests spread;
    For these restored the Cross, that from above
    Hallowed her sheltering banners, which incessant
    Flew between earth and the unholy Crescent,[242]
    Which, if it waned and dwindled, Earth may thank
    The city it has clothed in chains, which clank
    Now, creaking in the ears of those who owe
    The name of Freedom to her glorious struggles;                     120
    Yet she but shares with them a common woe,
    And called the "kingdom"[243] of a conquering foe,--
    But knows what all--and, most of all, _we_ know--
    With what set gilded terms a tyrant juggles!

                        IV.

    The name of Commonwealth is past and gone
      O'er the three fractions of the groaning globe;
    Venice is crushed, and Holland deigns to own
      A sceptre, and endures the purple robe;[244]
    If the free Switzer yet bestrides alone
    His chainless mountains, 't is but for a time,                     130
    For Tyranny of late is cunning grown,
    And in its own good season tramples down
    The sparkles of our ashes. One great clime,
    Whose vigorous offspring by dividing ocean[245]
    Are kept apart and nursed in the devotion
    Of Freedom, which their fathers fought for, and
    Bequeathed--a heritage of heart and hand,
    And proud distinction from each other land,
    Whose sons must bow them at a Monarch's motion,
    As if his senseless sceptre were a wand                            140
    Full of the magic of exploded science--
    Still one great clime, in full and free defiance,
    Yet rears her crest, unconquered and sublime,
    Above the far Atlantic!--She has taught
    Her Esau-brethren that the haughty flag,
    The floating fence of Albion's feebler crag,[246]
    May strike to those whose red right hands have bought
    Rights cheaply earned with blood.--Still, still, for ever
    Better, though each man's life-blood were a river,
    That it should flow, and overflow, than creep                      150
    Through thousand lazy channels in our veins,
    Dammed like the dull canal with locks and chains,
    And moving, as a sick man in his sleep,
    Three paces, and then faltering:--better be
    Where the extinguished Spartans still are free,
    In their proud charnel of Thermopylae,
    Than stagnate in our marsh,--or o'er the deep
    Fly, and one current to the ocean add,
    One spirit to the souls our fathers had,
    One freeman more, America, to thee![247]                           160



                                 MAZEPPA

                        I.

    'Twas after dread Pultowa's day,[248]
      When Fortune left the royal Swede--
    Around a slaughtered army lay,
      No more to combat and to bleed.
    The power and glory of the war,
      Faithless as their vain votaries, men,
    Had passed to the triumphant Czar,
      And Moscow's walls were safe again--
    Until a day more dark and drear,[249]
    And a more memorable year,                                          10
    Should give to slaughter and to shame
    A mightier host and haughtier name;
    A greater wreck, a deeper fall,
    A shock to one--a thunderbolt to all.

                        II.

    Such was the hazard of the die;
    The wounded Charles was taught to fly[250]
    By day and night through field and flood,
    Stained with his own and subjects' blood;
    For thousands fell that flight to aid:
    And not a voice was heard to upbraid                                20
    Ambition in his humbled hour,
    When Truth had nought to dread from Power.
    His horse was slain, and Gieta gave
    His own--and died the Russians' slave.
    This, too, sinks after many a league
    Of well-sustained, but vain fatigue;
    And in the depth of forests darkling,
    The watch-fires in the distance sparkling--
      The beacons of surrounding foes--
    A King must lay his limbs at length.                                30
      Are these the laurels and repose
    For which the nations strain their strength?
    They laid him by a savage tree,[251]
    In outworn Nature's agony;
    His wounds were stiff, his limbs were stark;
    The heavy hour was chill and dark;
    The fever in his blood forbade
    A transient slumber's fitful aid:
    And thus it was; but yet through all,
    Kinglike the monarch bore his fall,                                 40
    And made, in this extreme of ill,
    His pangs the vassals of his will:
    All silent and subdued were they.
    As once the nations round him lay.

                        III.

    A band of chiefs!--alas! how few,
      Since but the fleeting of a day
    Had thinned it; but this wreck was true
      And chivalrous: upon the clay
    Each sate him down, all sad and mute,
      Beside his monarch and his steed;                                 50
    For danger levels man and brute,
      And all are fellows in their need.
    Among the rest, Mazeppa made[252]
    His pillow in an old oak's shade--
    Himself as rough, and scarce less old,
    The Ukraine's Hetman, calm and bold;
    But first, outspent with this long course,
    The Cossack prince rubbed down his horse,
    And made for him a leafy bed,
      And smoothed his fetlocks and his mane,                           60
      And slacked his girth, and stripped his rein,
    And joyed to see how well he fed;
    For until now he had the dread
    His wearied courser might refuse
    To browse beneath the midnight dews:
    But he was hardy as his lord,
    And little cared for bed and board;
    But spirited and docile too,
    Whate'er was to be done, would do.
    Shaggy and swift, and strong of limb,                               70
    All Tartar-like he carried him;
    Obeyed his voice, and came to call,
    And knew him in the midst of all:
    Though thousands were around,--and Night,
    Without a star, pursued her flight,--
    That steed from sunset until dawn
    His chief would follow like a fawn.


                        IV.

    This done, Mazeppa spread his cloak,
    And laid his lance beneath his oak,
    Felt if his arms in order good                                      80
    The long day's march had well withstood--
    If still the powder filled the pan,
      And flints unloosened kept their lock--
    His sabre's hilt and scabbard felt,
    And whether they had chafed his belt;
    And next the venerable man,
    From out his havresack and can,
      Prepared and spread his slender stock;
    And to the Monarch and his men
    The whole or portion offered then                                   90
    With far less of inquietude
    Than courtiers at a banquet would.
    And Charles of this his slender share
    With smiles partook a moment there,
    To force of cheer a greater show,
    And seem above both wounds and woe;--
    And then he said--"Of all our band,
    Though firm of heart and strong of hand,
    In skirmish, march, or forage, none
    Can less have said or more have done                               100
    Than thee, Mazeppa! On the earth
    So fit a pair had never birth,
    Since Alexander's days till now,
    As thy Bucephalus and thou:
    All Scythia's fame to thine should yield
    For pricking on o'er flood and field."
    Mazeppa answered--"Ill betide
    The school wherein I learned to ride!"
    Quoth Charles--"Old Hetman, wherefore so,
    Since thou hast learned the art so well?"                          110
    Mazeppa said--"'Twere long to tell;
    And we have many a league to go,
    With every now and then a blow,
    And ten to one at least the foe,
    Before our steeds may graze at ease,
    Beyond the swift Borysthenes:[253]
    And, Sire, your limbs have need of rest,
    And I will be the sentinel
    Of this your troop."--"But I request,"
    Said Sweden's monarch, "thou wilt tell                             120
    This tale of thine, and I may reap,
    Perchance, from this the boon of sleep;
    For at this moment from my eyes
    The hope of present slumber flies."

    "Well, Sire, with such a hope, I'll track
    My seventy years of memory back:
    I think 'twas in my twentieth spring,--
    Aye 'twas,--when Casimir was king[254]--
    John Casimir,--I was his page
    Six summers, in my earlier age:[255]                               130
    A learned monarch, faith! was he,
    And most unlike your Majesty;
    He made no wars, and did not gain
    New realms to lose them back again;
    And (save debates in Warsaw's diet)
    He reigned in most unseemly quiet;
    Not that he had no cares to vex;
    He loved the Muses and the Sex;[256]
    And sometimes these so froward are,
    They made him wish himself at war;                                 140
    But soon his wrath being o'er, he took
    Another mistress--or new book:
    And then he gave prodigious fetes--
    All Warsaw gathered round his gates
    To gaze upon his splendid court,
    And dames, and chiefs, of princely port.
    He was the Polish Solomon,
    So sung his poets, all but one,
    Who, being unpensioned, made a satire,
    And boasted that he could not flatter.                             150
    It was a court of jousts and mimes,
    Where every courtier tried at rhymes;
    Even I for once produced some verses,
    And signed my odes 'Despairing Thyrsis.'
    There was a certain Palatine,[257]
      A Count of far and high descent,
    Rich as a salt or silver mine;[258]
    And he was proud, ye may divine,
      As if from Heaven he had been sent;
    He had such wealth in blood and ore                                160
      As few could match beneath the throne;
    And he would gaze upon his store,
    And o'er his pedigree would pore,
    Until by some confusion led,
    Which almost looked like want of head,
      He thought their merits were his own.
    His wife was not of this opinion;
      His junior she by thirty years,
    Grew daily tired of his dominion;
      And, after wishes, hopes, and fears,                             170
      To Virtue a few farewell tears,
    A restless dream or two--some glances
    At Warsaw's youth--some songs, and dances,
    Awaited but the usual chances,
    Those happy accidents which render
    The coldest dames so very tender,
    To deck her Count with titles given,
    'Tis said, as passports into Heaven;
    But, strange to say, they rarely boast
    Of these, who have deserved them most.                             180

                        V.

    "I was a goodly stripling then;
      At seventy years I so may say,
    That there were few, or boys or men,
      Who, in my dawning time of day,
    Of vassal or of knight's degree,
    Could vie in vanities with me;
    For I had strength--youth--gaiety,
    A port, not like to this ye see,
    But smooth, as all is rugged now;
      For Time, and Care, and War, have ploughed                       190
    My very soul from out my brow;
      And thus I should be disavowed
    By all my kind and kin, could they
    Compare my day and yesterday;
    This change was wrought, too, long ere age
    Had ta'en my features for his page:
    With years, ye know, have not declined
    My strength--my courage--or my mind,
    Or at this hour I should not be
    Telling old tales beneath a tree,                                  200
    With starless skies my canopy.
      But let me on: Theresa's[259] form--
    Methinks it glides before me now,
    Between me and yon chestnut's bough,
      The memory is so quick and warm;
    And yet I find no words to tell
    The shape of her I loved so well:
    She had the Asiatic eye,
      Such as our Turkish neighbourhood
      Hath mingled with our Polish blood,                              210
    Dark as above us is the sky;
    But through it stole a tender light,
    Like the first moonrise of midnight;
    Large, dark, and swimming in the stream,
    Which seemed to melt to its own beam;
    All love, half languor, and half fire,
    Like saints that at the stake expire,
    And lift their raptured looks on high,
    As though it were a joy to die.[bs]
    A brow like a midsummer lake,                                      220
      Transparent with the sun therein,
    When waves no murmur dare to make,
      And heaven beholds her face within.
    A cheek and lip--but why proceed?
      I loved her then, I love her still;
    And such as I am, love indeed
      In fierce extremes--in good and ill.
    But still we love even in our rage,
    And haunted to our very age
    With the vain shadow of the past,--                                230
    As is Mazeppa to the last.

                        VI.

    "We met--we gazed--I saw, and sighed;
    She did not speak, and yet replied;
    There are ten thousand tones and signs
    We hear and see, but none defines--
    Involuntary sparks of thought,
    Which strike from out the heart o'erwrought,
    And form a strange intelligence,
    Alike mysterious and intense,
    Which link the burning chain that binds,                           240
    Without their will, young hearts and minds;
    Conveying, as the electric[260] wire,
    We know not how, the absorbing fire.
    I saw, and sighed--in silence wept,
    And still reluctant distance kept,
    Until I was made known to her,
    And we might then and there confer
    Without suspicion--then, even then,
      I longed, and was resolved to speak;
    But on my lips they died again,                                    250
      The accents tremulous and weak,
    Until one hour.--There is a game,
      A frivolous and foolish play,
      Wherewith we while away the day;
    It is--I have forgot the name--
    And we to this, it seems, were set,
    By some strange chance, which I forget:
    I recked not if I won or lost,
      It was enough for me to be
      So near to hear, and oh! to see                                  260
    The being whom I loved the most.
    I watched her as a sentinel,
    (May ours this dark night watch as well!)
      Until I saw, and thus it was,
    That she was pensive, nor perceived
    Her occupation, nor was grieved
    Nor glad to lose or gain; but still
    Played on for hours, as if her will
    Yet bound her to the place, though not
    That hers might be the winning lot[bt].                            270
      Then through my brain the thought did pass,
    Even as a flash of lightning there,
    That there was something in her air
    Which would not doom me to despair;
    And on the thought my words broke forth,
      All incoherent as they were;
    Their eloquence was little worth,
    But yet she listened--'tis enough--
      Who listens once will listen twice;
      Her heart, be sure, is not of ice--                              280
    And one refusal no rebuff.

                        VII.

    "I loved, and was beloved again--
      They tell me, Sire, you never knew
      Those gentle frailties; if 'tis true,
    I shorten all my joy or pain;
    To you 'twould seem absurd as vain;
    But all men are not born to reign,
    Or o'er their passions, or as you
    Thus o'er themselves and nations too.
    I am--or rather _was_--a Prince,                                   290
      A chief of thousands, and could lead
      Them on where each would foremost bleed;
    But could not o'er myself evince
    The like control--But to resume:
      I loved, and was beloved again;
    In sooth, it is a happy doom,
      But yet where happiest ends in pain.--
    We met in secret, and the hour
    Which led me to that lady's bower
    Was fiery Expectation's dower.                                     300
    My days and nights were nothing--all
    Except that hour which doth recall,
    In the long lapse from youth to age,
      No other like itself: I'd give
      The Ukraine back again to live
    It o'er once more, and be a page,
    The happy page, who was the lord
    Of one soft heart, and his own sword,
    And had no other gem nor wealth,
    Save Nature's gift of Youth and Health.                            310
    We met in secret--doubly sweet[261],
    Some say, they find it so to meet;
    I know not that--I would have given
      My life but to have called her mine
    In the full view of Earth and Heaven;
      For I did oft and long repine
    That we could only meet by stealth.

                        VIII.

    "For lovers there are many eyes,
      And such there were on us; the Devil
      On such occasions should be civil--                              320
    The Devil!--I'm loth to do him wrong,
      It might be some untoward saint,
    Who would not be at rest too long,
      But to his pious bile gave vent--
    But one fair night, some lurking spies
    Surprised and seized us both.
    The Count was something more than wroth--
    I was unarmed; but if in steel,
    All cap-a-pie from head to heel,
    What 'gainst their numbers could I do?                             330
    'Twas near his castle, far away
      From city or from succour near,
    And almost on the break of day;
    I did not think to see another,
      My moments seemed reduced to few;
    And with one prayer to Mary Mother,
      And, it may be, a saint or two,
    As I resigned me to my fate,
    They led me to the castle gate:
      Theresa's doom I never knew,                                     340
    Our lot was henceforth separate.
    An angry man, ye may opine,
    Was he, the proud Count Palatine;
    And he had reason good to be,
      But he was most enraged lest such
      An accident should chance to touch
    Upon his future pedigree;
    Nor less amazed, that such a blot
    His noble 'scutcheon should have got,
    While he was highest of his line;                                  350
      Because unto himself he seemed
      The first of men, nor less he deemed
    In others' eyes, and most in mine.
    'Sdeath! with a _page_--perchance a king
    Had reconciled him to the thing;
    But with a stripling of a page--
    I felt--but cannot paint his rage.

                        IX.

    "'Bring forth the horse!'--the horse was brought!
    In truth, he was a noble steed,
      A Tartar of the Ukraine breed,                                   360
    Who looked as though the speed of thought
    Were in his limbs; but he was wild,
      Wild as the wild deer, and untaught,
    With spur and bridle undefiled--
      'Twas but a day he had been caught;
    And snorting, with erected mane,
    And struggling fiercely, but in vain,
    In the full foam of wrath and dread
    To me the desert-born was led:
    They bound me on, that menial throng,
    Upon his back with many a thong;                                   370
    They loosed him with a sudden lash--
    Away!--away!--and on we dash!--
    Torrents less rapid and less rash.

                        X.

    "Away!--away!--My breath was gone,
    I saw not where he hurried on:
    'Twas scarcely yet the break of day,
    And on he foamed--away!--away!
    The last of human sounds which rose,
    As I was darted from my foes,                                      380
    Was the wild shout of savage laughter,
    Which on the wind came roaring after
    A moment from that rabble rout:
    With sudden wrath I wrenched my head,
      And snapped the cord, which to the mane
      Had bound my neck in lieu of rein,
    And, writhing half my form about,
    Howled back my curse; but 'midst the tread,
    The thunder of my courser's speed,
    Perchance they did not hear nor heed:                              390
    It vexes me--for I would fain
    Have paid their insult back again.
    I paid it well in after days:
    There is not of that castle gate,
    Its drawbridge and portcullis' weight,
    Stone--bar--moat--bridge--or barrier left;
    Nor of its fields a blade of grass,
      Save what grows on a ridge of wall,
      Where stood the hearth-stone of the hall;
    And many a time ye there might pass,                               400
    Nor dream that e'er the fortress was.
    I saw its turrets in a blaze,
    Their crackling battlements all cleft,
      And the hot lead pour down like rain
    From off the scorched and blackening roof,
    Whose thickness was not vengeance-proof.
      They little thought that day of pain,
    When launched, as on the lightning's flash,
    They bade me to destruction dash,
      That one day I should come again,                                410
    With twice five thousand horse, to thank
      The Count for his uncourteous ride.
    They played me then a bitter prank,
      When, with the wild horse for my guide,
    They bound me to his foaming flank:
    At length I played them one as frank--
    For Time at last sets all things even--
      And if we do but watch the hour,
      There never yet was human power
    Which could evade, if unforgiven,                                  420
    The patient search and vigil long
    Of him who treasures up a wrong.

                        XI.

    "Away!--away!--my steed and I,
      Upon the pinions of the wind!
      All human dwellings left behind,
    We sped like meteors through the sky,
    When with its crackling sound the night[262]
    Is chequered with the Northern light.
    Town--village--none were on our track,
      But a wild plain of far extent,                                  430
    And bounded by a forest black[263];
      And, save the scarce seen battlement
    On distant heights of some strong hold,
    Against the Tartars built of old,
    No trace of man. The year before
    A Turkish army had marched o'er;
    And where the Spahi's hoof hath trod,
    The verdure flies the bloody sod:
    The sky was dull, and dim, and gray,
      And a low breeze crept moaning by--                              440
      I could have answered with a sigh--
    But fast we fled,--away!--away!--
    And I could neither sigh nor pray;
    And my cold sweat-drops fell like rain
    Upon the courser's bristling mane;
    But, snorting still with rage and fear,
    He flew upon his far career:
    At times I almost thought, indeed,
    He must have slackened in his speed;
    But no--my bound and slender frame                                 450
      Was nothing to his angry might,
    And merely like a spur became:
    Each motion which I made to free
    My swoln limbs from their agony
      Increased his fury and affright:
    I tried my voice,--'twas faint and low--
    But yet he swerved as from a blow;
    And, starting to each accent, sprang
    As from a sudden trumpet's clang:
    Meantime my cords were wet with gore,                              460
    Which, oozing through my limbs, ran o'er;
    And in my tongue the thirst became
    A something fierier far than flame.

                        XII.

    "We neared the wild wood--'twas so wide,
    I saw no bounds on either side:
    'Twas studded with old sturdy trees,
    That bent not to the roughest breeze
    Which howls down from Siberia's waste,
    And strips the forest in its haste,--
    But these were few and far between,                                470
    Set thick with shrubs more young and green,
    Luxuriant with their annual leaves,
    Ere strown by those autumnal eyes
    That nip the forest's foliage dead,
    Discoloured with a lifeless red[bu],
    Which stands thereon like stiffened gore
    Upon the slain when battle's o'er;
    And some long winter's night hath shed
    Its frost o'er every tombless head--
    So cold and stark--the raven's beak                                480
    May peck unpierced each frozen cheek:
    'Twas a wild waste of underwood,
    And here and there a chestnut stood,
    The strong oak, and the hardy pine;
      But far apart--and well it were,
    Or else a different lot were mine--
      The boughs gave way, and did not tear
    My limbs; and I found strength to bear
    My wounds, already scarred with cold;
    My bonds forbade to loose my hold.                                 490
    We rustled through the leaves like wind,--
    Left shrubs, and trees, and wolves behind;
    By night I heard them on the track,
    Their troop came hard upon our back,
    With their long gallop, which can tire
    The hound's deep hate, and hunter's fire:
    Where'er we flew they followed on,
    Nor left us with the morning sun;
    Behind I saw them, scarce a rood,
    At day-break winding through the wood,                             500
    And through the night had heard their feet
    Their stealing, rustling step repeat.
    Oh! how I wished for spear or sword,
    At least to die amidst the horde,
    And perish--if it must be so--
    At bay, destroying many a foe!
    When first my courser's race begun,
    I wished the goal already won;
    But now I doubted strength and speed:
    Vain doubt! his swift and savage breed                             510
    Had nerved him like the mountain-roe--
    Nor faster falls the blinding snow
    Which whelms the peasant near the door
    Whose threshold he shall cross no more,
    Bewildered with the dazzling blast,
    Than through the forest-paths he passed--
    Untired, untamed, and worse than wild--
    All furious as a favoured child
    Balked of its wish; or--fiercer still--
    A woman piqued--who has her will!                                  520

                        XIII.

    "The wood was passed; 'twas more than noon,
    But chill the air, although in June;
    Or it might be my veins ran cold--
    Prolonged endurance tames the bold;
    And I was then not what I seem,
    But headlong as a wintry stream,
    And wore my feelings out before
    I well could count their causes o'er:
    And what with fury, fear, and wrath,
    The tortures which beset my path--                                 530
    Cold--hunger--sorrow--shame--distress--
    Thus bound in Nature's nakedness;
    Sprung from a race whose rising blood
    When stirred beyond its calmer mood,
    And trodden hard upon, is like
    The rattle-snake's, in act to strike--
    What marvel if this worn-out trunk
    Beneath its woes a moment sunk?[264]
    The earth gave way, the skies rolled round,
    I seemed to sink upon the ground;                                  540
    But erred--for I was fastly bound.
    My heart turned sick, my brain grew sore,
    And throbbed awhile, then beat no more:
    The skies spun like a mighty wheel;
    I saw the trees like drunkards reel,
    And a slight flash sprang o'er my eyes,
    Which saw no farther. He who dies
    Can die no more than then I died,
    O'ertortured by that ghastly ride.[265]
    I felt the blackness come and go,                                  550
      And strove to wake; but could not make
    My senses climb up from below:
    I felt as on a plank at sea,
    When all the waves that dash o'er thee,
    At the same time upheave and whelm,
    And hurl thee towards a desert realm.
    My undulating life was as
    The fancied lights that flitting pass
    Our shut eyes in deep midnight, when
    Fever begins upon the brain;                                       560
    But soon it passed, with little pain,
      But a confusion worse than such:
      I own that I should deem it much,
    Dying, to feel the same again;
    And yet I do suppose we must
    Feel far more ere we turn to dust!
    No matter! I have bared my brow
    Full in Death's face--before--and now.

                        XIV.

    "My thoughts came back. Where was I? Cold,
      And numb, and giddy: pulse by pulse                              570
    Life reassumed its lingering hold,
    And throb by throb,--till grown a pang
      Which for a moment would convulse,
      My blood reflowed, though thick and chill;
    My ear with uncouth noises rang,
      My heart began once more to thrill;
    My sight returned, though dim; alas!
    And thickened, as it were, with glass.
    Methought the dash of waves was nigh;
    There was a gleam too of the sky,                                  580
    Studded with stars;--it is no dream;
    The wild horse swims the wilder stream!
    The bright broad river's gushing tide
    Sweeps, winding onward, far and wide,
    And we are half-way, struggling o'er
    To yon unknown and silent shore.
    The waters broke my hollow trance,
    And with a temporary strength
      My stiffened limbs were rebaptized.
    My courser's broad breast proudly braves,                          590
    And dashes off the ascending waves,
    And onward we advance!
    We reach the slippery shore at length,
      A haven I but little prized,
    For all behind was dark and drear,
    And all before was night and fear.
    How many hours of night or day[266]
    In those suspended pangs I lay,
    I could not tell; I scarcely knew
    If this were human breath I drew.                                  600

                        XV.

    "With glossy skin, and dripping mane,
      And reeling limbs, and reeking flank,
    The wild steed's sinewy nerves still strain
      Up the repelling bank.
    We gain the top: a boundless plain
    Spreads through the shadow of the night,
      And onward, onward, onward--seems,
      Like precipices in our dreams,[267]
    To stretch beyond the sight;
    And here and there a speck of white,                               610
      Or scattered spot of dusky green,
    In masses broke into the light,
    As rose the moon upon my right:
      But nought distinctly seen
    In the dim waste would indicate
    The omen of a cottage gate;
    No twinkling taper from afar
    Stood like a hospitable star;
    Not even an ignis-fatuus rose[268]
    To make him merry with my woes:                                    620
      That very cheat had cheered me then!
    Although detected, welcome still,
    Reminding me, through every ill,
      Of the abodes of men.

                        XVI.

    "Onward we went--but slack and slow;
      His savage force at length o'erspent,
    The drooping courser, faint and low,
      All feebly foaming went:
    A sickly infant had had power
    To guide him forward in that hour!                                 630
      But, useless all to me,
    His new-born tameness nought availed--
    My limbs were bound; my force had failed,
      Perchance, had they been free.
    With feeble effort still I tried
    To rend the bonds so starkly tied,
      But still it was in vain;
    My limbs were only wrung the more,
    And soon the idle strife gave o'er,
      Which but prolonged their pain.                                  640
    The dizzy race seemed almost done,
    Although no goal was nearly won:
    Some streaks announced the coming sun--
      How slow, alas! he came!
    Methought that mist of dawning gray
    Would never dapple into day,
    How heavily it rolled away!
      Before the eastern flame
    Rose crimson, and deposed the stars,
    And called the radiance from their cars,[bv]                       650
    And filled the earth, from his deep throne,
    With lonely lustre, all his own.

                        XVII.

    "Uprose the sun; the mists were curled
    Back from the solitary world
    Which lay around--behind--before.
    What booted it to traverse o'er
    Plain--forest--river? Man nor brute,
    Nor dint of hoof, nor print of foot,
    Lay in the wild luxuriant soil--
    No sign of travel, none of toil--                                  660
    The very air was mute:
    And not an insect's shrill small horn,[269]
    Nor matin bird's new voice was borne
    From herb nor thicket. Many a _werst,_
    Panting as if his heart would burst,
    The weary brute still staggered on;
    And still we were--or seemed--alone:
    At length, while reeling on our way,
    Methought I heard a courser neigh,
    From out yon tuft of blackening firs.                              670
    Is it the wind those branches stirs?[270]
    No, no! from out the forest prance
      A trampling troop; I see them come!
    In one vast squadron they advance!
      I strove to cry--my lips were dumb!
    The steeds rush on in plunging pride;
    But where are they the reins to guide?
    A thousand horse, and none to ride!
    With flowing tail, and flying mane,
    Wide nostrils never stretched by pain,                             680
    Mouths bloodless to the bit or rein,
    And feet that iron never shod,
    And flanks unscarred by spur or rod,
    A thousand horse, the wild, the free,
    Like waves that follow o'er the sea,
      Came thickly thundering on,
    As if our faint approach to meet!
    The sight re-nerved my courser's feet,
    A moment staggering, feebly fleet,
    A moment, with a faint low neigh,                                  690
      He answered, and then fell!
    With gasps and glazing eyes he lay,
      And reeking limbs immoveable,
        His first and last career is done!
    On came the troop--they saw him stoop,
      They saw me strangely bound along
      His back with many a bloody thong.
    They stop--they start--they snuff the air,
    Gallop a moment here and there,
    Approach, retire, wheel round and round,                           700
    Then plunging back with sudden bound,
    Headed by one black mighty steed,
    Who seemed the Patriarch of his breed,
      Without a single speck or hair
    Of white upon his shaggy hide;
    They snort--they foam--neigh--swerve aside,
    And backward to the forest fly,
    By instinct, from a human eye.
      They left me there to my despair,
    Linked to the dead and stiffening wretch,                          710
    Whose lifeless limbs beneath me stretch,
    Relieved from that unwonted weight,
    From whence I could not extricate
    Nor him nor me--and there we lay,
      The dying on the dead!
    I little deemed another day
      Would see my houseless, helpless head.

    "And there from morn to twilight bound,
    I felt the heavy hours toil round,
    With just enough of life to see                                    720
    My last of suns go down on me,
    In hopeless certainty of, mind,
    That makes us feel at length resigned
    To that which our foreboding years
    Present the worst and last of fears:
    Inevitable--even a boon,
    Nor more unkind for coming soon,
    Yet shunned and dreaded with such care,
    As if it only were a snare
      That Prudence might escape:                                      730
    At times both wished for and implored,
    At times sought with self-pointed sword,
    Yet still a dark and hideous close
    To even intolerable woes,
      And welcome in no shape.
    And, strange to say, the sons of pleasure,
    They who have revelled beyond measure
    In beauty, wassail, wine, and treasure,
    Die calm, or calmer, oft than he
    Whose heritage was Misery.                                         740
    For he who hath in turn run through
    All that was beautiful and new,
      Hath nought to hope, and nought to leave;
    And, save the future, (which is viewed
    Not quite as men are base or good,
    But as their nerves may be endued,)
      With nought perhaps to grieve:
    The wretch still hopes his woes must end,
    And Death, whom he should deem his friend,
    Appears, to his distempered eyes,                                  750
    Arrived to rob him of his prize,
    The tree of his new Paradise.
    To-morrow would have given him all,
    Repaid his pangs, repaired his fall;
    To-morrow would have been the first
    Of days no more deplored or curst,
    But bright, and long, and beckoning years,
    Seen dazzling through the mist of tears,
    Guerdon of many a painful hour;
    To-morrow would have given him power                               760
    To rule--to shine--to smite--to save--
    And must it dawn upon his grave?

                        XVIII.

    "The sun was sinking--still I lay
      Chained to the chill and stiffening steed!
    I thought to mingle there our clay;[271]
      And my dim eyes of death had need,
      No hope arose of being freed.
    I cast my last looks up the sky,
      And there between me and the sun[272]
    I saw the expecting raven fly,                                     770
    Who scarce would wait till both should die,
      Ere his repast begun;[273]
    He flew, and perched, then flew once more,
    And each time nearer than before;
    I saw his wing through twilight flit,
    And once so near me he alit
      I could have smote, but lacked the strength;
    But the slight motion of my hand,
    And feeble scratching of the sand,
    The exerted throat's faint struggling noise,                       780
    Which scarcely could be called a voice,
      Together scared him off at length.
    I know no more--my latest dream
      Is something of a lovely star
      Which fixed my dull eyes from afar,
    And went and came with wandering beam,
    And of the cold--dull--swimming--dense
    Sensation of recurring sense,
    And then subsiding back to death,
    And then again a little breath,                                    790
    A little thrill--a short suspense,
      An icy sickness curdling o'er
    My heart, and sparks that crossed my brain--
    A gasp--a throb--a start of pain,
      A sigh--and nothing more.

                        XIX.

    "I woke--where was I?--Do I see
    A human face look down on me?
    And doth a roof above me close?
    Do these limbs on a couch repose?
    Is this a chamber where I lie?                                     800
    And is it mortal yon bright eye,
    That watches me with gentle glance?
      I closed my own again once more,
    As doubtful that my former trance
      Could not as yet be o'er.
    A slender girl, long-haired, and tall,
    Sate watching by the cottage wall.
    The sparkle of her eye I caught,
    Even with my first return of thought;
    For ever and anon she threw                                        810
      A prying, pitying glance on me
      With her black eyes so wild and free:
    I gazed, and gazed, until I knew
      No vision it could be,--
    But that I lived, and was released
    From adding to the vulture's feast:
    And when the Cossack maid beheld
    My heavy eyes at length unsealed,
    She smiled--and I essayed to speak,
      But failed--and she approached, and made                         820
      With lip and finger signs that said,
    I must not strive as yet to break
    The silence, till my strength should be
    Enough to leave my accents free;
    And then her hand on mine she laid,
    And smoothed the pillow for my head,
    And stole along on tiptoe tread,
      And gently oped the door, and spake
    In whispers--ne'er was voice so sweet![274]
    Even music followed her light feet.                                830
      But those she called were not awake,
    And she went forth; but, ere she passed,
    Another look on me she cast,
      Another sign she made, to say,
    That I had nought to fear, that all
    Were near, at my command or call,
      And she would not delay
    Her due return:--while she was gone,
    Methought I felt too much alone.

                        XX.

    "She came with mother and with sire--                              840
    What need of more?--I will not tire
    With long recital of the rest,
    Since I became the Cossack's guest.
    They found me senseless on the plain,
      They bore me to the nearest hut,
    They brought me into life again--
    Me--one day o'er their realm to reign!
      Thus the vain fool who strove to glut
    His rage, refining on my pain,
      Sent me forth to the wilderness,                                 850
    Bound--naked--bleeding--and alone,
    To pass the desert to a throne,--
      What mortal his own doom may guess?
      Let none despond, let none despair!
    To-morrow the Borysthenes
    May see our coursers graze at ease
    Upon his Turkish bank,--and never
    Had I such welcome for a river
      As I shall yield when safely there.[275]
    Comrades, good night!"--The Hetman threw                           860
      His length beneath the oak-tree shade,
      With leafy couch already made--
    A bed nor comfortless nor new
    To him, who took his rest whene'er
    The hour arrived, no matter where:
      His eyes the hastening slumbers steep.
    And if ye marvel Charles forgot
    To thank his tale, _he_ wondered not,--
      The King had been an hour asleep!


                               DEDICATION.


    Lady! if for the cold and cloudy clime
      Where I was born, but where I would not die,
      Of the great Poet-Sire of Italy
    I dare to build[276] the imitative rhyme,
    Harsh Runic[277] copy of the South's sublime,
      Thou art the cause; and howsoever I
      Fall short of his immortal harmony,
    Thy gentle heart will pardon me the crime.
    Thou, in the pride of Beauty and of Youth,
       Spakest; and for thee to speak and be obeyed
    Are one; but only in the sunny South
      Such sounds are uttered, and such charms displayed,
    So sweet a language from so fair a mouth--[278]
      Ah! to what effort would it not persuade?

                                                 Ravenna, June 21, 1819.





                                 PREFACE

In the course of a visit to the city of Ravenna in the summer of 1819,
it was suggested to the author that having composed something on the
subject of Tasso's confinement, he should do the same on Dante's
exile,--the tomb of the poet forming one of the principal objects[279]
of interest in that city, both to the native and to the stranger.

"On this hint I spake," and the result has been the following four
cantos, in _terza rima_, now offered to the reader. If they are
understood and approved, it is my purpose to continue the poem in
various other cantos to its natural conclusion in the present age. The
reader is requested to suppose that Dante addresses him in the interval
between the conclusion of the _Divina Commedia_ and his death, and
shortly before the latter event, foretelling the fortunes of Italy in
general in the ensuing centuries. In adopting this plan I have had in my
mind the Cassandra of Lycophron,[280] and the Prophecy of Nereus by
Horace, as well as the Prophecies of Holy Writ. The measure adopted is
the _terza rima_ of Dante, which I am not aware to have seen hitherto
_tried in our language, except it may be by Mr. Hayley_,[281] of whose
translation I never saw but one extract, quoted in the notes to _Caliph
Vathek_; so that--if I do not err--this poem may be considered as a
metrical experiment. The cantos are short, and about the same length of
those of the poet, whose name I have borrowed and most likely taken in
vain.

Amongst the inconveniences of authors in the present day, it is
difficult for any who have a name, good or bad, to escape translation. I
have had the fortune to see the fourth canto of _Childe Harold_[282]
translated into Italian _versi sciolti_,--that is, a poem written in the
_Spenserean stanza_ into _blank verse_, without regard to the natural
divisions of the stanza or the sense. If the present poem, being on a
national topic, should chance to undergo the same fate, I would request
the Italian reader to remember that when I have failed in the imitation
of his great "Padre Alighier,"[283] I have failed in imitating that
which all study and few understand, since to this very day it is not yet
settled what was the meaning of the allegory[284] in the first canto of
the _Inferno_, unless Count Marchetti's ingenious and probable
conjecture may be considered as having decided the question.

He may also pardon my failure the more, as I am not quite sure that he
would be pleased with my success, since the Italians, with a pardonable
nationality, are particularly jealous of all that is left them as a
nation--their literature; and in the present bitterness of the classic
and romantic war, are but ill disposed to permit a foreigner even to
approve or imitate them, without finding some fault with his
ultramontane presumption. I can easily enter into all this, knowing what
would be thought in England of an Italian imitator of Milton, or if a
translation of Monti, Pindemonte, or Arici,[285] should be held up to
the rising generation as a model for their future poetical essays. But I
perceive that I am deviating into an address to the Italian reader,
where my business is with the English one; and be they few or many, I
must take my leave of both.




                          THE PROPHECY OF DANTE.


                             CANTO THE FIRST.

    Once more in Man's frail world! which I had left
      So long that 'twas forgotten; and I feel
      The weight of clay again,--too soon bereft
    Of the Immortal Vision which could heal
      My earthly sorrows, and to God's own skies
      Lift me from that deep Gulf without repeal,
    Where late my ears rung with the damned cries
      Of Souls in hopeless bale; and from that place
      Of lesser torment, whence men may arise
    Pure from the fire to join the Angelic race;                        10
      Midst whom my own bright Beatric?[286] blessed
      My spirit with her light; and to the base
    Of the Eternal Triad! first, last, best,[287]
      Mysterious, three, sole, infinite, great God!
      Soul universal! led the mortal guest,
    Unblasted by the Glory, though he trod
      From star to star to reach the almighty throne.[bw]
      Oh Beatrice! whose sweet limbs the sod
    So long hath pressed, and the cold marble stone,
      Thou sole pure Seraph of my earliest love,                        20
      Love so ineffable, and so alone,
    That nought on earth could more my bosom move,
      And meeting thee in Heaven was but to meet
      That without which my Soul, like the arkless dove,
    Had wandered still in search of, nor her feet
      Relieved her wing till found; without thy light
      My Paradise had still been incomplete.[288]
    Since my tenth sun gave summer to my sight
      Thou wert my Life, the Essence of my thought,
      Loved ere I knew the name of Love,[289] and bright                30
    Still in these dim old eyes, now overwrought
      With the World's war, and years, and banishment,
      And tears for thee, by other woes untaught;
    For mine is not a nature to be bent
      By tyrannous faction, and the brawling crowd,
      And though the long, long conflict hath been spent
    In vain,--and never more, save when the cloud
      Which overhangs the Apennine my mind's eye
      Pierces to fancy Florence, once so proud
    Of me, can I return, though but to die,                             40
      Unto my native soil,--they have not yet
      Quenched the old exile's spirit, stern and high.
    But the Sun, though not overcast, must set
      And the night cometh; I am old in days,
      And deeds, and contemplation, and have met
    Destruction face to face in all his ways.
      The World hath left me, what it found me, pure,
      And if I have not gathered yet its praise,
    I sought it not by any baser lure;
      Man wrongs, and Time avenges, and my name                         50
      May form a monument not all obscure,
    Though such was not my Ambition's end or aim,
      To add to the vain-glorious list of those
      Who dabble in the pettiness of fame,
    And make men's fickle breath the wind that blows
      Their sail, and deem it glory to be classed
      With conquerors, and Virtue's other foes,
    In bloody chronicles of ages past.
      I would have had my Florence great and free;[290]
      Oh Florence! Florence![291] unto me thou wast                     60
    Like that Jerusalem which the Almighty He
      Wept over, "but thou wouldst not;" as the bird
      Gathers its young, I would have gathered thee
    Beneath a parent pinion, hadst thou heard
      My voice; but as the adder, deaf and fierce,
      Against the breast that cherished thee was stirred
    Thy venom, and my state thou didst amerce,
      And doom this body forfeit to the fire.[292]
      Alas! how bitter is his country's curse
    To him who _for_ that country would expire,                         70
      But did not merit to expire _by_ her,
      And loves her, loves her even in her ire.
    The day may come when she will cease to err,
      The day may come she would be proud to have
      The dust she dooms to scatter, and transfer[bx]
    Of him, whom she denied a home, the grave.
      But this shall not be granted; let my dust
      Lie where it falls; nor shall the soil which gave
    Me breath, but in her sudden fury thrust
      Me forth to breathe elsewhere, so reassume                        80
      My indignant bones, because her angry gust
    Forsooth is over, and repealed her doom;
      No,--she denied me what was mine--my roof,
      And shall not have what is not hers--my tomb.
    Too long her armed wrath hath kept aloof
      The breast which would have bled for her, the heart
      That beat, the mind that was temptation proof,
    The man who fought, toiled, travelled, and each part
      Of a true citizen fulfilled, and saw
      For his reward the Guelf's ascendant art                          90
    Pass his destruction even into a law.
      These things are not made for forgetfulness,
      Florence shall be forgotten first; too raw
    The wound, too deep the wrong, and the distress
      Of such endurance too prolonged to make
      My pardon greater, her injustice less,
    Though late repented; yet--yet for her sake
      I feel some fonder yearnings, and for thine,
      My own Beatric?, I would hardly take
    Vengeance upon the land which once was mine,                       100
      And still is hallowed by thy dust's return,
      Which would protect the murderess like a shrine,
    And save ten thousand foes by thy sole urn.
      Though, like old Marius from Minturnae's marsh
      And Carthage ruins, my lone breast may burn
    At times with evil feelings hot and harsh,[293]
      And sometimes the last pangs of a vile foe
      Writhe in a dream before me, and o'erarch
    My brow with hopes of triumph,--let them go!
      Such are the last infirmities of those                           110
      Who long have suffered more than mortal woe,
    And yet being mortal still, have no repose
      But on the pillow of Revenge--Revenge,
      Who sleeps to dream of blood, and waking glows
    With the oft-baffled, slakeless thirst of change,
      When we shall mount again, and they that trod
      Be trampled on, while Death and Ate range
    O'er humbled heads and severed necks----Great God!
      Take these thoughts from me--to thy hands I yield
      My many wrongs, and thine Almighty rod                           120
    Will fall on those who smote me,--be my Shield!
      As thou hast been in peril, and in pain,
      In turbulent cities, and the tented field--
    In toil, and many troubles borne in vain
      For Florence,--I appeal from her to Thee!
      Thee, whom I late saw in thy loftiest reign,
    Even in that glorious Vision, which to see
      And live was never granted until now,
      And yet thou hast permitted this to me.
    Alas! with what a weight upon my brow                              130
      The sense of earth and earthly things come back,
      Corrosive passions, feelings dull and low,
    The heart's quick throb upon the mental rack,
      Long day, and dreary night; the retrospect
      Of half a century bloody and black,
    And the frail few years I may yet expect
      Hoary and hopeless, but less hard to bear,
      For I have been too long and deeply wrecked
    On the lone rock of desolate Despair,
      To lift my eyes more to the passing sail                         140
      Which shuns that reef so horrible and bare;
    Nor raise my voice--for who would heed my wail?
      I am not of this people, nor this age,
      And yet my harpings will unfold a tale
    Which shall preserve these times when not a page
      Of their perturbed annals could attract
      An eye to gaze upon their civil rage,[by]
    Did not my verse embalm full many an act
      Worthless as they who wrought it: 'tis the doom
      Of spirits of my order to be racked                              150
    In life, to wear their hearts out, and consume
      Their days in endless strife, and die alone;
      Then future thousands crowd around their tomb,
    And pilgrims come from climes where they have known
      The name of him--who now is but a name,
      And wasting homage o'er the sullen stone,
    Spread his--by him unheard, unheeded--fame;
      And mine at least hath cost me dear: to die
      Is nothing; but to wither thus--to tame
    My mind down from its own infinity--                               160
      To live in narrow ways with little men,
      A common sight to every common eye,
    A wanderer, while even wolves can find a den,
      Ripped from all kindred, from all home, all things
      That make communion sweet, and soften pain--
    To feel me in the solitude of kings
      Without the power that makes them bear a crown--
      To envy every dove his nest and wings
    Which waft him where the Apennine looks down
      On Arno, till he perches, it may be,                             170
      Within my all inexorable town,
    Where yet my boys are, and that fatal She,[294]
      Their mother, the cold partner who hath brought
      Destruction for a dowry--this to see
    And feel, and know without repair, hath taught
      A bitter lesson; but it leaves me free:
      I have not vilely found, nor basely sought,
    They made an Exile--not a Slave of me.


                            CANTO THE SECOND.

    The Spirit of the fervent days of Old,
      When words were things that came to pass, and Thought
      Flashed o'er the future, bidding men behold
    Their children's children's doom already brought
      Forth from the abyss of Time which is to be,
      The Chaos of events, where lie half-wrought
    Shapes that must undergo mortality;
      What the great Seers of Israel wore within,
      That Spirit was on them, and is on me,
    And if, Cassandra-like, amidst the din                              10
      Of conflict none will hear, or hearing heed
      This voice from out the Wilderness, the sin
    Be theirs, and my own feelings be my meed,
      The only guerdon I have ever known.
      Hast thou not bled? and hast thou still to bleed,
    Italia? Ah! to me such things, foreshown
      With dim sepulchral light, bid me forget
      In thine irreparable wrongs my own;
    We can have but one Country, and even yet
      Thou'rt mine--my bones shall be within thy breast,                20
      My Soul within thy language, which once set
    With our old Roman sway in the wide West;
      But I will make another tongue arise
      As lofty and more sweet, in which expressed
    The hero's ardour, or the lover's sighs,
      Shall find alike such sounds for every theme
      That every word, as brilliant as thy skies,
    Shall realise a Poet's proudest dream,
      And make thee Europe's Nightingale of Song;[295]
      So that all present speech to thine shall seem                    30
    The note of meaner birds, and every tongue
      Confess its barbarism when compared with thine.[bz]
      This shalt thou owe to him thou didst so wrong,
    Thy Tuscan bard, the banished Ghibelline.
      Woe! woe! the veil of coming centuries
      Is rent,--a thousand years which yet supine
    Lie like the ocean waves ere winds arise,
      Heaving in dark and sullen undulation,
      Float from Eternity into these eyes;
    The storms yet sleep, the clouds still keep their station,          40
      The unborn Earthquake yet is in the womb,
      The bloody Chaos yet expects Creation,
    But all things are disposing for thy doom;
      The Elements await but for the Word,
      "Let there be darkness!" and thou grow'st a tomb!
    Yes! thou, so beautiful, shalt feel the sword,[296]
      Thou, Italy! so fair that Paradise,
      Revived in thee, blooms forth to man restored:
    Ah! must the sons of Adam lose it twice?
      Thou, Italy! whose ever golden fields,                            50
      Ploughed by the sunbeams solely, would suffice
    For the world's granary; thou, whose sky Heaven gilds[ca]
      With brighter stars, and robes with deeper blue;
      Thou, in whose pleasant places Summer builds
    Her palace, in whose cradle Empire grew,
      And formed the Eternal City's ornaments
      From spoils of Kings whom freemen overthrew;
    Birthplace of heroes, sanctuary of Saints,
      Where earthly first, then heavenly glory made[cb]
      Her home; thou, all which fondest Fancy paints,                   60
    And finds her prior vision but portrayed
      In feeble colours, when the eye--from the Alp
      Of horrid snow, and rock, and shaggy shade
    Of desert-loving pine, whose emerald scalp
      Nods to the storm--dilates and dotes o'er thee,
      And wistfully implores, as 'twere, for help
    To see thy sunny fields, my Italy,
      Nearer and nearer yet, and dearer still
      The more approached, and dearest were they free,
    Thou--Thou must wither to each tyrant's will:                       70
      The Goth hath been,--the German, Frank, and Hun[297]
      Are yet to come,--and on the imperial hill
    Ruin, already proud of the deeds done
      By the old barbarians, there awaits the new,
      Throned on the Palatine, while lost and won
    Rome at her feet lies bleeding; and the hue
      Of human sacrifice and Roman slaughter
      Troubles the clotted air, of late so blue,
    And deepens into red the saffron water
      Of Tiber, thick with dead; the helpless priest,                   80
      And still more helpless nor less holy daughter,
    Vowed to their God, have shrieking fled, and ceased
      Their ministry: the nations take their prey,
      Iberian, Almain, Lombard, and the beast
    And bird, wolf, vulture, more humane than they
      Are; these but gorge the flesh, and lap the gore
      Of the departed, and then go their way;
    But those, the human savages, explore
      All paths of torture, and insatiate yet,
      With Ugolino hunger prowl for more.                               90
    Nine moons shall rise o'er scenes like this and set;[298]
      The chiefless army of the dead, which late
      Beneath the traitor Prince's banner met,
    Hath left its leader's ashes at the gate;
      Had but the royal Rebel lived, perchance
      Thou hadst been spared, but his involved thy fate.
    Oh! Rome, the Spoiler or the spoil of France,
      From Brennus to the Bourbon, never, never
      Shall foreign standard to thy walls advance,
    But Tiber shall become a mournful river.                           100
      Oh! when the strangers pass the Alps and Po,
      Crush them, ye Rocks! Floods whelm them, and for ever!
    Why sleep the idle Avalanches so,
      To topple on the lonely pilgrim's head?
      Why doth Eridanus but overflow
    The peasant's harvest from his turbid bed?
      Were not each barbarous horde a nobler prey?
      Over Cambyses' host[299] the desert spread
    Her sandy ocean, and the Sea-waves' sway
      Rolled over Pharaoh and his thousands,--why,[cc]                 110
      Mountains and waters, do ye not as they?
    And you, ye Men! Romans, who dare not die,
      Sons of the conquerors who overthrew
      Those who overthrew proud Xerxes, where yet lie
    The dead whose tomb Oblivion never knew,
      Are the Alps weaker than Thermopylae?
      Their passes more alluring to the view
    Of an invader? is it they, or ye,
      That to each host the mountain-gate unbar,
      And leave the march in peace, the passage free?                  120
    Why, Nature's self detains the Victor's car,
      And makes your land impregnable, if earth
      Could be so; but alone she will not war,
    Yet aids the warrior worthy of his birth
      In a soil where the mothers bring forth men:
      Not so with those whose souls are little worth;
    For them no fortress can avail,--the den
      Of the poor reptile which preserves its sting
      Is more secure than walls of adamant, when
    The hearts of those within are quivering.                          130
      Are ye not brave? Yes, yet the Ausonian soil
      Hath hearts, and hands, and arms, and hosts to bring
    Against Oppression; but how vain the toil,
      While still Division sows the seeds of woe
      And weakness, till the Stranger reaps the spoil.[300]
    Oh! my own beauteous land! so long laid low,
      So long the grave of thy own children's hopes,
      When there is but required a single blow
    To break the chain, yet--yet the Avenger stops,
      And Doubt and Discord step 'twixt thine and thee,                140
      And join their strength to that which with thee copes;
    What is there wanting then to set thee free,
      And show thy beauty in its fullest light?
      To make the Alps impassable; and we,
    Her Sons, may do this with one deed--Unite.


                            CANTO THE THIRD.

    From out the mass of never-dying ill,[cd]
      The Plague, the Prince, the Stranger, and the Sword,
      Vials of wrath but emptied to refill
    And flow again, I cannot all record
      That crowds on my prophetic eye: the Earth
      And Ocean written o'er would not afford
    Space for the annal, yet it shall go forth;
      Yes, all, though not by human pen, is graven,
      There where the farthest suns and stars have birth,
    Spread like a banner at the gate of Heaven,                         10
      The bloody scroll of our millennial wrongs
      Waves, and the echo of our groans is driven
    Athwart the sound of archangelic songs,
      And Italy, the martyred nation's gore,
      Will not in vain arise to where belongs[ce]
    Omnipotence and Mercy evermore:
      Like to a harpstring stricken by the wind,
      The sound of her lament shall, rising o'er
    The Seraph voices, touch the Almighty Mind.
      Meantime I, humblest of thy sons, and of                          20
      Earth's dust by immortality refined
    To Sense and Suffering, though the vain may scoff,
      And tyrants threat, and meeker victims bow
      Before the storm because its breath is rough,
    To thee, my Country! whom before, as now,
      I loved and love, devote the mournful lyre
      And melancholy gift high Powers allow
    To read the future: and if now my fire
      Is not as once it shone o'er thee, forgive!
      I but foretell thy fortunes--then expire;                         30
    Think not that I would look on them and live.
      A Spirit forces me to see and speak,
      And for my guerdon grants _not_ to survive;
    My Heart shall be poured over thee and break:
      Yet for a moment, ere I must resume
      Thy sable web of Sorrow, let me take
    Over the gleams that flash athwart thy gloom
      A softer glimpse; some stars shine through thy night,
      And many meteors, and above thy tomb
    Leans sculptured Beauty, which Death cannot blight:                 40
      And from thine ashes boundless Spirits rise
      To give thee honour, and the earth delight;
    Thy soil shall still be pregnant with the wise,
      The gay, the learned, the generous, and the brave,
      Native to thee as Summer to thy skies,
    Conquerors on foreign shores, and the far wave,[301]
      Discoverers of new worlds, which take their name;[302]
      For _thee_ alone they have no arm to save,
    And all thy recompense is in their fame,
      A noble one to them, but not to thee--                            50
      Shall they be glorious, and thou still the same?
    Oh! more than these illustrious far shall be
      The Being--and even yet he may be born--
      The mortal Saviour who shall set thee free,
    And see thy diadem, so changed and worn
      By fresh barbarians, on thy brow replaced;
      And the sweet Sun replenishing thy morn,
    Thy moral morn, too long with clouds defaced,
      And noxious vapours from Avernus risen,
      Such as all they must breathe who are debased                     60
    By Servitude, and have the mind in prison.[303]
      Yet through this centuried eclipse of woe[cf]
      Some voices shall be heard, and Earth shall listen;
    Poets shall follow in the path I show,
      And make it broader: the same brilliant sky
      Which cheers the birds to song shall bid them glow,[cg]
    And raise their notes as natural and high;
      Tuneful shall be their numbers; they shall sing
      Many of Love, and some of Liberty,
    But few shall soar upon that Eagle's wing,                          70
      And look in the Sun's face, with Eagle's gaze,
      All free and fearless as the feathered King,
    But fly more near the earth; how many a phrase
      Sublime shall lavished be on some small prince
      In all the prodigality of Praise!
    And language, eloquently false, evince[ch]
      The harlotry of Genius, which, like Beauty,[ci]
      Too oft forgets its own self-reverence,
    And looks on prostitution as a duty.[304]
      He who once enters in a Tyrant's hall[cj][305]                    80
      As guest is slave--his thoughts become a booty,
    And the first day which sees the chain enthral
      A captive, sees his half of Manhood gone[306]--
      The Soul's emasculation saddens all
    His spirit; thus the Bard too near the throne
      Quails from his inspiration, bound to _please_,--
      How servile is the task to please alone!
    To smooth the verse to suit his Sovereign's ease
      And royal leisure, nor too much prolong
      Aught save his eulogy, and find, and seize,                       90
    Or force, or forge fit argument of Song!
      Thus trammelled, thus condemned to Flattery's trebles,
      He toils through all, still trembling to be wrong:
    For fear some noble thoughts, like heavenly rebels,
      Should rise up in high treason to his brain,
      He sings, as the Athenian spoke, with pebbles
    In's mouth, lest Truth should stammer through his strain.
      But out of the long file of sonneteers
      There shall be some who will not sing in vain,
    And he, their Prince, shall rank among my peers,[307]
      And Love shall be his torment; but his grief
      Shall make an immortality of tears,
    And Italy shall hail him as the Chief
      Of Poet-lovers, and his higher song
      Of Freedom wreathe him with as green a leaf.
    But in a farther age shall rise along
      The banks of Po two greater still than he;
      The World which smiled on him shall do them wrong
    Till they are ashes, and repose with me.
      The first will make an epoch with his lyre,                      110
      And fill the earth with feats of Chivalry:[308]
    His Fancy like a rainbow, and his Fire,
      Like that of Heaven, immortal, and his Thought
      Borne onward with a wing that cannot tire;
    Pleasure shall, like a butterfly new caught,
      Flutter her lovely pinions o'er his theme,
      And Art itself seem into Nature wrought
    By the transparency of his bright dream.--
      The second, of a tenderer, sadder mood,
      Shall pour his soul out o'er Jerusalem;                          120
    He, too, shall sing of Arms, and Christian blood
      Shed where Christ bled for man; and his high harp
      Shall, by the willow over Jordan's flood,
    Revive a song of Sion, and the sharp
      Conflict, and final triumph of the brave
      And pious, and the strife of Hell to warp
    Their hearts from their great purpose, until wave
      The red-cross banners where the first red Cross
      Was crimsoned from His veins who died to save,[ck]
    Shall be his sacred argument; the loss                             130
      Of years, of favour, freedom, even of fame
      Contested for a time, while the smooth gloss
    Of Courts would slide o'er his forgotten name
      And call Captivity a kindness--meant
      To shield him from insanity or shame--
    Such shall be his meek guerdon! who was sent
      To be Christ's Laureate--they reward him well!
      Florence dooms me but death or banishment,
    Ferrara him a pittance and a cell,[309]
      Harder to bear and less deserved, for I                          140
      Had stung the factions which I strove to quell;
    But this meek man who with a lover's eye
      Will look on Earth and Heaven, and who will deign
      To embalm with his celestial flattery,
    As poor a thing as e'er was spawned to reign,[310]
      What will _he_ do to merit such a doom?
      Perhaps he'll _love_,--and is not Love in vain
    Torture enough without a living tomb?
      Yet it will be so--he and his compeer,
      The Bard of Chivalry, will both consume[311]                     150
    In penury and pain too many a year,
      And, dying in despondency, bequeath
      To the kind World, which scarce will yield a tear,
    A heritage enriching all who breathe
      With the wealth of a genuine Poet's soul,
      And to their country a redoubled wreath,
    Unmatched by time; not Hellas can unroll
      Through her Olympiads two such names, though one[312]
      Of hers be mighty;--and is this the whole
    Of such men's destiny beneath the Sun?[313]                        160
      Must all the finer thoughts, the thrilling sense,
      The electric blood with which their arteries run,[cl]
    Their body's self turned soul with the intense
      Feeling of that which is, and fancy of
      That which should be, to such a recompense
    Conduct? shall their bright plumage on the rough
      Storm be still scattered? Yes, and it must be;
      For, formed of far too penetrable stuff,
    These birds of Paradise[314] but long to flee
      Back to their native mansion, soon they find                     170
      Earth's mist with their pure pinions not agree,
    And die or are degraded; for the mind
      Succumbs to long infection, and despair,
      And vulture Passions flying close behind,
    Await the moment to assail and tear;[315]
      And when, at length, the winged wanderers stoop,
      Then is the Prey-birds' triumph, then they share
    The spoil, o'erpowered at length by one fell swoop.
      Yet some have been untouched who learned to bear,
      Some whom no Power could ever force to droop,                    180
    Who could resist themselves even, hardest care!
      And task most hopeless; but some such have been,
      And if my name amongst the number were,
    That Destiny austere, and yet serene,
      Were prouder than more dazzling fame unblessed;
      The Alp's snow summit nearer heaven is seen
    Than the Volcano's fierce eruptive crest,
      Whose splendour from the black abyss is flung,
      While the scorched mountain, from whose burning breast
    A temporary torturing flame is wrung,                              190
      Shines for a night of terror, then repels
      Its fire back to the Hell from whence it sprung,
    The Hell which in its entrails ever dwells.


                           CANTO THE FOURTH.

    Many are Poets who have never penned
      Their inspiration, and perchance the best:
      They felt, and loved, and died, but would not lend
    Their thoughts to meaner beings; they compressed
      The God within them, and rejoined the stars
      Unlaurelled upon earth, but far more blessed
    Than those who are degraded by the jars
      Of Passion, and their frailties linked to fame,
      Conquerors of high renown, but full of scars.
    Many are Poets but without the name;                                10
      For what is Poesy but to create
      From overfeeling Good or Ill; and aim[316]
    At an external life beyond our fate,
      And be the new Prometheus of new men,[317]
      Bestowing fire from Heaven, and then, too late,
    Finding the pleasure given repaid with pain,
      And vultures to the heart of the bestower,
      Who, having lavished his high gift in vain,
    Lies to his lone rock by the sea-shore?
      So be it: we can bear.--But thus all they                         20
      Whose Intellect is an o'ermastering Power
    Which still recoils from its encumbering clay
      Or lightens it to spirit, whatsoe'er
      The form which their creations may essay,
    Are bards; the kindled Marble's bust may wear
      More poesy upon its speaking brow
      Than aught less than the Homeric page may bear;
    One noble stroke with a whole life may glow,
      Or deify the canvass till it shine
      With beauty so surpassing all below,                              30
    That they who kneel to Idols so divine
      Break no commandment, for high Heaven is there
      Transfused, transfigurated:[318] and the line
    Of Poesy, which peoples but the air
      With Thought and Beings of our thought reflected,
      Can do no more: then let the artist share
    The palm, he shares the peril, and dejected
      Faints o'er the labour unapproved--Alas!
      Despair and Genius are too oft connected.
    Within the ages which before me pass                                40
      Art shall resume and equal even the sway
      Which with Apelles and old Phidias
    She held in Hellas' unforgotten day.
      Ye shall be taught by Ruin to revive
      The Grecian forms at least from their decay,
    And Roman souls at last again shall live
      In Roman works wrought by Italian hands,
      And temples, loftier than the old temples, give
    New wonders to the World; and while still stands
      The austere Pantheon, into heaven shall soar                      50
      A Dome,[319] its image, while the base expands
    Into a fane surpassing all before,
      Such as all flesh shall flock to kneel in: ne'er
      Such sight hath been unfolded by a door
    As this, to which all nations shall repair,
      And lay their sins at this huge gate of Heaven.
      And the bold Architect[320] unto whose care
    The daring charge to raise it shall be given,
      Whom all Arts shall acknowledge as their Lord,
      Whether into the marble chaos driven                              60
    His chisel bid the Hebrew,[321] at whose word
      Israel left Egypt, stop the waves in stone,[cm]
      Or hues of Hell be by his pencil poured
    Over the damned before the Judgement-throne,[322]
      Such as I saw them, such as all shall see,
      Or fanes be built of grandeur yet unknown--
    The Stream of his great thoughts shall spring from me[323]
      The Ghibelline, who traversed the three realms
      Which form the Empire of Eternity.
    Amidst the clash of swords, and clang of helms,                     70
      The age which I anticipate, no less
      Shall be the Age of Beauty, and while whelms
    Calamity the nations with distress,
      The Genius of my Country shall arise,
      A Cedar towering o'er the Wilderness,
    Lovely in all its branches to all eyes,
      Fragrant as fair, and recognised afar,
      Wafting its native incense through the skies.
    Sovereigns shall pause amidst their sport of war,
      Weaned for an hour from blood, to turn and gaze                   80
      On canvass or on stone; and they who mar
    All beauty upon earth, compelled to praise,
      Shall feel the power of that which they destroy;
      And Art's mistaken gratitude shall raise
    To tyrants, who but take her for a toy,
      Emblems and monuments, and prostitute
      Her charms to Pontiffs proud,[324] who but employ
    The man of Genius as the meanest brute
      To bear a burthen, and to serve a need,
      To sell his labours, and his soul to boot.                        90
    Who toils for nations may be poor indeed,
      But free; who sweats for Monarchs is no more
      Than the gilt Chamberlain, who, clothed and feed,
    Stands sleek and slavish, bowing at his door.
      Oh, Power that rulest and inspirest! how
      Is it that they on earth, whose earthly power[325]
    Is likest thine in heaven in outward show,
      Least like to thee in attributes divine,
      Tread on the universal necks that bow,
    And then assure us that their rights are thine?                    100
      And how is it that they, the Sons of Fame,
      Whose inspiration seems to them to shine
    From high, they whom the nations oftest name,
      Must pass their days in penury or pain,
      Or step to grandeur through the paths of shame,
    And wear a deeper brand and gaudier chain?
      Or if their Destiny be born aloof
      From lowliness, or tempted thence in vain,
    In their own souls sustain a harder proof,
      The inner war of Passions deep and fierce?                       110
      Florence! when thy harsh sentence razed my roof,
    I loved thee; but the vengeance of my verse,
      The hate of injuries which every year
      Makes greater, and accumulates my curse,
    Shall live, outliving all thou holdest dear--
      Thy pride, thy wealth, thy freedom, and even _that_,
      The most infernal of all evils here,
    The sway of petty tyrants in a state;
      For such sway is not limited to Kings,
      And Demagogues yield to them but in date,                        120
    As swept off sooner; in all deadly things,
      Which make men hate themselves, and one another,
      In discord, cowardice, cruelty, all that springs
    From Death the Sin-born's incest with his mother,[326]
      In rank oppression in its rudest shape,
      The faction Chief is but the Sultan's brother,
    And the worst Despot's far less human ape.
      Florence! when this lone spirit, which so long
      Yearned, as the captive toiling at escape,
    To fly back to thee in despite of wrong,                           130
      An exile, saddest of all prisoners,[327]
      Who has the whole world for a dungeon strong,
    Seas, mountains, and the horizon's[328] verge for bars,[cn]
      Which shut him from the sole small spot of earth
      Where--whatsoe'er his fate--he still were hers,
    His Country's, and might die where he had birth--
      Florence! when this lone Spirit shall return
      To kindred Spirits, thou wilt feel my worth,
    And seek to honour with an empty urn[329]
      The ashes thou shalt ne'er obtain--Alas!                         140
      "What have I done to thee, my People?"[330] Stern
    Are all thy dealings, but in this they pass
      The limits of Man's common malice, for
      All that a citizen could be I was--
    Raised by thy will, all thine in peace or war--
      And for this thou hast warred with me.--'Tis done:
      I may not overleap the eternal bar[331]
    Built up between us, and will die alone,
      Beholding with the dark eye of a Seer
      The evil days to gifted souls foreshown,                         150
    Foretelling them to those who will not hear;
      As in the old time, till the hour be come
      When Truth shall strike their eyes through many a tear,
    And make them own the Prophet in his tomb.

                                                            Ravenna, 1819.


                       THE MORGANTE MAGGIORE.[335]



                             CANTO THE FIRST.


                        I.

    In the beginning was the Word next God;
      God was the Word, the Word no less was He:
    This was in the beginning, to my mode
      Of thinking, and without Him nought could be:
    Therefore, just Lord! from out thy high abode,
      Benign and pious, bid an angel flee,
    One only, to be my companion, who
    Shall help my famous, worthy, old song through.

                        II.

    And thou, oh Virgin! daughter, mother, bride,
      Of the same Lord, who gave to you each key
    Of Heaven, and Hell, and every thing beside,
      The day thy Gabriel said "All hail!" to thee,
    Since to thy servants Pity's ne'er denied,
      With flowing rhymes, a pleasant style and free,
    Be to my verses then benignly kind,
    And to the end illuminate my mind.

                        III.

    'Twas in the season when sad Philomel[336]
      Weeps with her sister, who remembers and
    Deplores the ancient woes which both befel,
      And makes the nymphs enamoured, to the hand
    Of Phaeton, by Phoebus loved so well,
      His car (but tempered by his sire's command)
    Was given, and on the horizon's verge just now
    Appeared, so that Tithonus scratched his brow:

                        IV.

    When I prepared my bark first to obey,
      As it should still obey, the helm, my mind,
    And carry prose or rhyme, and this my lay
      Of Charles the Emperor, whom you will find
    By several pens already praised; but they
      Who to diffuse his glory were inclined,
    For all that I can see in prose or verse,
    Have understood Charles badly, and wrote worse.

                        V.

    Leonardo Aretino said already,[337]
      That if, like Pepin, Charles had had a writer
    Of genius quick, and diligently steady,
      No hero would in history look brighter;
    He in the cabinet being always ready,
      And in the field a most victorious fighter,
    Who for the church and Christian faith had wrought,
    Certes, far more than yet is said or thought.

                        VI.

    You still may see at Saint Liberatore,[338]
      The abbey, no great way from Manopell,
    Erected in the Abruzzi to his glory,
      Because of the great battle in which fell
    A pagan king, according to the story,
      And felon people whom Charles sent to Hell:
    And there are bones so many, and so many,
    Near them Giusaffa's[339] would seem few, if any.

                        VII.

    But the world, blind and ignorant, don't prize
      His virtues as I wish to see them: thou,
    Florence, by his great bounty don't arise,[340]
      And hast, and may have, if thou wilt allow,
    All proper customs and true courtesies:
      Whate'er thou hast acquired from then till now,
    With knightly courage, treasure, or the lance,
    Is sprung from out the noble blood of France.


                        VIII.

    Twelve Paladins had Charles in court, of whom
      The wisest and most famous was Orlando;
    Him traitor Gan[341] conducted to the tomb
      In Roncesvalles, as the villain planned too,
    While the horn rang so loud, and knelled the doom
      Of their sad rout, though he did all knight can do:
    And Dante in his comedy has given
    To him a happy seat with Charles in Heaven.[342]

                        IX.

    'Twas Christmas-day; in Paris all his court
      Charles held; the Chief, I say, Orlando was,
    The Dane; Astolfo there too did resort,
      Also Ansuigi, the gay time to pass
    In festival and in triumphal sport,
      The much-renowned St. Dennis being the cause;
    Angiolin of Bayonne, and Oliver,
    And gentle Belinghieri too came there:

                        X.

    Avolio, and Arino, and Othone
      Of Normandy, and Richard Paladin,
    Wise Hamo, and the ancient Salamone,
      Walter of Lion's Mount, and Baldovin,
    Who was the son of the sad Ganellone,
      Were there, exciting too much gladness in
    The son of Pepin:--when his knights came hither,
    He groaned with joy to see them altogether.

                        XI.

    But watchful Fortune, lurking, takes good heed
      Ever some bar 'gainst our intents to bring.
    While Charles reposed him thus, in word and deed,
      Orlando ruled court, Charles, and every thing;
    Curst Gan, with envy bursting, had such need
      To vent his spite, that thus with Charles the king
    One day he openly began to say,
    "Orlando must we always then obey?

                        XII.

    "A thousand times I've been about to say,
      Orlando too presumptuously goes on;
    Here are we, counts, kings, dukes, to own thy sway,
      Hamo, and Otho, Ogier, Solomon,
    Each have to honour thee and to obey;
      But he has too much credit near the throne,
    Which we won't suffer, but are quite decided
    By such a boy to be no longer guided.

                        XIII.

    "And even at Aspramont thou didst begin
      To let him know he was a gallant knight,
    And by the fount did much the day to win;
      But I know _who_ that day had won the fight
    If it had not for good Gherardo been;
      The victory was Almonte's else; his sight
    He kept upon the standard--and the laurels,
    In fact and fairness, are his earning, Charles!

                        XIV.

    "If thou rememberest being in Gascony,
      When there advanced the nations out of Spain
    The Christian cause had suffered shamefully,
      Had not his valour driven them back again.
    Best speak the truth when there's a reason why:
      Know then, oh Emperor! that all complain:
    As for myself, I shall repass the mounts
    O'er which I crossed with two and sixty counts.

                        XV.

    "'Tis fit thy grandeur should dispense relief,
      So that each here may have his proper part,
    For the whole court is more or less in grief:
      Perhaps thou deem'st this lad a Mars in heart?"
    Orlando one day heard this speech in brief,
      As by himself it chanced he sate apart:
    Displeased he was with Gan because he said it,
    But much more still that Charles should give him credit.

                        XVI.

    And with the sword he would have murdered Gan,
      But Oliver thrust in between the pair,
    And from his hand extracted Durlindan,
      And thus at length they separated were.
    Orlando angry too with Carloman,
      Wanted but little to have slain him there;
    Then forth alone from Paris went the Chief,
    And burst and maddened with disdain and grief.

                        XVII.

    From Ermellina, consort of the Dane,
      He took Cortana, and then took Rondell,
    And on towards Brara pricked him o'er the plain;
      And when she saw him coming, Aldabelle
    Stretched forth her arms to clasp her lord again:
      Orlando, in whose brain all was not well,
    As "Welcome, my Orlando, home," she said,
    Raised up his sword to smite her on the head.

                        XVIII.

    Like him a Fury counsels, his revenge
      On Gan in that rash act he seemed to take,
    Which Aldabella thought extremely strange;
      But soon Orlando found himself awake;
    And his spouse took his bridle on this change,
      And he dismounted from his horse, and spake
    Of every thing which passed without demur,
    And then reposed himself some days with her.

                        XIX.

    Then full of wrath departed from the place,
      As far as pagan countries roamed astray,
    And while he rode, yet still at every pace
      The traitor Gan remembered by the way;
    And wandering on in error a long space,
      An abbey which in a lone desert lay,
    'Midst glens obscure, and distant lands, he found,
    Which formed the Christian's and the Pagan's bound.

                        XX.

    The Abbot was called Clermont, and by blood
      Descended from Angrante: under cover
    Of a great mountain's brow the abbey stood,
      But certain savage giants looked him over;
    One Passamont was foremost of the brood,
      And Alabaster and Morgante hover
    Second and third, with certain slings, and throw
    In daily jeopardy the place below.

                        XXI.

    The monks could pass the convent gate no more,
      Nor leave their cells for water or for wood;
    Orlando knocked, but none would ope, before
      Unto the Prior it at length seemed good;
    Entered, he said that he was taught to adore
      Him who was born of Mary's holiest blood,
    And was baptized a Christian; and then showed
    How to the abbey he had found his road.

                        XXII.

    Said the Abbot, "You are welcome; what is mine
      We give you freely, since that you believe
    With us in Mary Mother's Son divine;
      And that you may not, Cavalier, conceive
    The cause of our delay to let you in
      To be rusticity, you shall receive
    The reason why our gate was barred to you:
    Thus those who in suspicion live must do.

                        XXIII.

    "When hither to inhabit first we came
      These mountains, albeit that they are obscure,
    As you perceive, yet without fear or blame
      They seemed to promise an asylum sure:
    From savage brutes alone, too fierce to tame,
      'Twas fit our quiet dwelling to secure;
    But now, if here we'd stay, we needs must guard
    Against domestic beasts with watch and ward.

                        XXIV.

    "These make us stand, in fact, upon the watch;
      For late there have appeared three giants rough,
    What nation or what kingdom bore the batch
      I know not, but they are all of savage stuff;
    When Force and Malice with some genius match,
      You know, they can do all--_we_ are not enough:
    And these so much our orisons derange,
    I know not what to do, till matters change.

                        XXV.

    "Our ancient fathers, living the desert in,
      For just and holy works were duly fed;
    Think not they lived on locusts sole, 'tis certain
      That manna was rained down from heaven instead;
    But here 'tis fit we keep on the alert in
      Our bounds, or taste the stones showered down for bread,
    From off yon mountain daily raining faster,
    And flung by Passamont and Alabaster.

                        XXVI.

    "The third, Morgante, 's savagest by far; he
      Plucks up pines, beeches, poplar-trees, and oaks,
    And flings them, our community to bury;
      And all that I can do but more provokes."
    While thus they parley in the cemetery,
      A stone from one of their gigantic strokes,
    Which nearly crushed Rondell, came tumbling over,
    So that he took a long leap under cover.

                        XXVII.

    "For God-sake, Cavalier, come in with speed;
      The manna's falling now," the Abbot cried.
    "This fellow does not wish my horse should feed,
      Dear Abbot," Roland unto him replied,
    "Of restiveness he'd cure him had he need;
      That stone seems with good will and aim applied."
    The holy father said, "I don't deceive;
    They'll one day fling the mountain, I believe."

                        XXVIII.

    Orlando bade them take care of Rondello,
      And also made a breakfast of his own;
    "Abbot," he said, "I want to find that fellow
      Who flung at my good horse yon corner-stone."
    Said the abbot, "Let not my advice seem shallow;
      As to a brother dear I speak alone;
    I would dissuade you, Baron, from this strife,
    As knowing sure that you will lose your life.

                        XXIX.

    "That Passamont has in his hand three darts--
      Such slings, clubs, ballast-stones, that yield you must:
    You know that giants have much stouter hearts
      Than us, with reason, in proportion just:
    If go you will, guard well against their arts,
      For these are very barbarous and robust."
    Orlando answered," This I'll see, be sure,
    And walk the wild on foot to be secure."

                        XXX.

    The Abbot signed the great cross on his front,
      "Then go you with God's benison and mine."
    Orlando, after he had scaled the mount,
      As the Abbot had directed, kept the line
    Right to the usual haunt of Passamont;
      Who, seeing him alone in this design,
    Surveyed him fore and aft with eyes observant,
    Then asked him, "If he wished to stay as servant?"

                        XXXI.

    And promised him an office of great ease.
      But, said Orlando, "Saracen insane!
    I come to kill you, if it shall so please
      God, not to serve as footboy in your train;
    You with his monks so oft have broke the peace--
      Vile dog! 'tis past his patience to sustain."
    The Giant ran to fetch his arms, quite furious,
    When he received an answer so injurious.

                        XXXII.

    And being returned to where Orlando stood,
      Who had not moved him from the spot, and swinging
    The cord, he hurled a stone with strength so rude,
      As showed a sample of his skill in slinging;
    It rolled on Count Orlando's helmet good
      And head, and set both head and helmet ringing,
    So that he swooned with pain as if he died,
    But more than dead, he seemed so stupified.

                        XXXIII.

    Then Passamont, who thought him slain outright,
      Said, "I will go, and while he lies along,
    Disarm me: why such craven did I fight?"
      But Christ his servants ne'er abandons long,
    Especially Orlando, such a knight,
      As to desert would almost be a wrong.
    While the giant goes to put off his defences,
    Orlando has recalled his force and senses:

                        XXXIV.

    And loud he shouted, "Giant, where dost go?
      Thou thought'st me doubtless for the bier outlaid;
    To the right about--without wings thou'rt too slow
      To fly my vengeance--currish renegade!
    'Twas but by treachery thou laid'st me low."
      The giant his astonishment betrayed,
    And turned about, and stopped his journey on,
    And then he stooped to pick up a great stone.

                        XXXV.

    Orlando had Cortana bare in hand;
      To split the head in twain was what he schemed:
    Cortana clave the skull like a true brand,
      And pagan Passamont died unredeemed;
    Yet harsh and haughty, as he lay he banned,
      And most devoutly Macon still blasphemed[343];
    But while his crude, rude blasphemies he heard,
    Orlando thanked the Father and the Word,--

                        XXXVI.

    Saying, "What grace to me thou'st this day given!
      And I to thee, O Lord! am ever bound;
    I know my life was saved by thee from Heaven,
      Since by the Giant I was fairly downed.
    All things by thee are measured just and even;
      Our power without thine aid would nought be found:
    I pray thee take heed of me, till I can
    At least return once more to Carloman."

                        XXXVII.

    And having said thus much, he went his way;
      And Alabaster he found out below,
    Doing the very best that in him lay
      To root from out a bank a rock or two.
    Orlando, when he reached him, loud 'gan say,
      "How think'st thou, glutton, such a stone to throw?"
    When Alabaster heard his deep voice ring,
    He suddenly betook him to his sling,

                        XXXVIII.

    And hurled a fragment of a size so large
      That if it had in fact fulfilled its mission,
    And Roland not availed him of his targe,
      There would have been no need of a physician[344].
    Orlando set himself in turn to charge,
      And in his bulky bosom made incision
    With all his sword. The lout fell; but o'erthrown, he
    However by no means forgot Macone.

                        XXXIX.

    Morgante had a palace in his mode,
      Composed of branches, logs of wood, and earth,
    And stretched himself at ease in this abode,
      And shut himself at night within his berth.
    Orlando knocked, and knocked again, to goad
      The giant from his sleep; and he came forth,
    The door to open, like a crazy thing,
    For a rough dream had shook him slumbering.

                        XL.

    He thought that a fierce serpent had attacked him,
      And Mahomet he called; but Mahomet
    Is nothing worth, and, not an instant backed him;
      But praying blessed Jesu, he was set
    At liberty from all the fears which racked him;
      And to the gate he came with great regret--
    "Who knocks here?" grumbling all the while, said he.
    "That," said Orlando, "you will quickly see:

                        XLI.

    "I come to preach to you, as to your brothers,--
      Sent by the miserable monks--repentance;
    For Providence divine, in you and others,
      Condemns the evil done, my new acquaintance!
    'Tis writ on high--your wrong must pay another's:
      From Heaven itself is issued out this sentence.
    Know then, that colder now than a pilaster
    I left your Passamont and Alabaster."

                        XLII.

    Morgante said, "Oh gentle Cavalier!
      Now by thy God say me no villany;
    The favour of your name I fain would hear,
      And if a Christian, speak for courtesy."
    Replied Orlando, "So much to your ear
      I by my faith disclose contentedly;
    Christ I adore, who is the genuine Lord,
    And, if you please, by you may be adored."

                        XLIII.

    The Saracen rejoined in humble tone,
      "I have had an extraordinary vision;
    A savage serpent fell on me alone,
      And Macon would not pity my condition;
    Hence to thy God, who for ye did atone
      Upon the cross, preferred I my petition;
    His timely succour set me safe and free,
    And I a Christian am disposed to be."

                        XLIV.

    Orlando answered, "Baron just and pious,
      If this good wish your heart can really move
    To the true God, who will not then deny us
      Eternal honour, you will go above,
    And, if you please, as friends we will ally us,
      And I will love you with a perfect love.
    Your idols are vain liars, full of fraud:
    The only true God is the Christian's God.

                        XLV.

    "The Lord descended to the virgin breast
      Of Mary Mother, sinless and divine;
    If you acknowledge the Redeemer blest,
      Without whom neither sun nor star can shine,
    Abjure bad Macon's false and felon test,
      Your renegado god, and worship mine,
    Baptize yourself with zeal, since you repent."
    To which Morgante answered, "I'm content."

                        XLVI.

    And then Orlando to embrace him flew,
      And made much of his convert, as he cried,
    "To the abbey I will gladly marshal you."
      To whom Morgante, "Let us go," replied:
    "I to the friars have for peace to sue."
      Which thing Orlando heard with inward pride,
    Saying, "My brother, so devout and good,
    Ask the Abbot pardon, as I wish you would:

                        XLVII.

    "Since God has granted your illumination,
      Accepting you in mercy for his own,
    Humility should be your first oblation."
      Morgante said, "For goodness' sake, make known,--
    Since that your God is to be mine--your station,
      And let your name in verity be shown;
    Then will I everything at your command do."
    On which the other said, he was Orlando.

                        XLVIII.

    "Then," quoth the Giant, "blessed be Jesu
      A thousand times with gratitude and praise!
    Oft, perfect Baron! have I heard of you
      Through all the different periods of my days:
    And, as I said, to be your vassal too
      I wish, for your great gallantry always."
    Thus reasoning, they continued much to say,
    And onwards to the abbey went their way.

                        XLIX.

    And by the way about the giants dead
      Orlando with Morgante reasoned: "Be,
    For their decease, I pray you, comforted,
      And, since it is God's pleasure, pardon me;
    A thousand wrongs unto the monks they bred;
      And our true Scripture soundeth openly,
    Good is rewarded, and chastised the ill,
    Which the Lord never faileth to fulfil:

                        L.

    "Because His love of justice unto all
      Is such, He wills His judgment should devour
    All who have sin, however great or small;
      But good He well remembers to restore.
    Nor without justice holy could we call
      Him, whom I now require you to adore.
    All men must make His will their wishes sway,
    And quickly and spontaneously obey.

                        LI.

    "And here our doctors are of one accord,
      Coming on this point to the same conclusion,--
    That in their thoughts, who praise in Heaven the Lord,
      If Pity e'er was guilty of intrusion
    For their unfortunate relations stored
      In Hell below, and damned in great confusion,
    Their happiness would be reduced to nought,--
    And thus unjust the Almighty's self be thought.

                        LII.

    "But they in Christ have firmest hope, and all
      Which seems to Him, to them too must appear
    Well done; nor could it otherwise befall;
      He never can in any purpose err.
    If sire or mother suffer endless thrall,
      They don't disturb themselves for him or her:
    What pleases God to them must joy inspire;--
    Such is the observance of the eternal choir."

                        LIII.

    "A word unto the wise," Morgante said,
      "Is wont to be enough, and you shall see
    How much I grieve about my brethren dead;
      And if the will of God seem good to me,
    Just, as you tell me, 'tis in Heaven obeyed--
      Ashes to ashes,--merry let us be!
    I will cut off the hands from both their trunks,
    And carry them unto the holy monks.

                        LIV.

    "So that all persons may be sure and certain
      That they are dead, and have no further fear
    To wander solitary this desert in,
      And that they may perceive my spirit clear
    By the Lord's grace, who hath withdrawn the curtain
      Of darkness, making His bright realm appear."
    He cut his brethren's hands off at these words,
    And left them to the savage beasts and birds.

                        LV.

    Then to the abbey they went on together,
      Where waited them the Abbot in great doubt.
    The monks, who knew not yet the fact, ran thither
      To their superior, all in breathless rout,
    Saying with tremor, "Please to tell us whether
      You wish to have this person in or out?"
    The Abbot, looking through upon the Giant,
    Too greatly feared, at first, to be compliant.

                        LVI.

    Orlando seeing him thus agitated,
      Said quickly, "Abbot, be thou of good cheer;
    He Christ believes, as Christian must be rated,
      And hath renounced his Macon false;" which here
    Morgante with the hands corroborated,
      A proof of both the giants' fate quite clear:
    Thence, with due thanks, the Abbot God adored,
    Saying, "Thou hast contented me, O Lord!"

                        LVII.

    He gazed; Morgante's height he calculated,
      And more than once contemplated his size;
    And then he said, "O Giant celebrated!
      Know, that no more my wonder will arise,
    How you could tear and fling the trees you late did,
      When I behold your form with my own eyes.
    You now a true and perfect friend will show
    Yourself to Christ, as once you were a foe.

                        LVIII.

    "And one of our apostles, Saul once named,
      Long persecuted sore the faith of Christ,
    Till, one day, by the Spirit being inflamed,
      'Why dost thou persecute me thus?' said Christ;
    And then from his offence he was reclaimed,
      And went for ever after preaching Christ,
    And of the faith became a trump, whose sounding
    O'er the whole earth is echoing and rebounding.

                        LIX.

    "So, my Morgante, you may do likewise:
      He who repents--thus writes the Evangelist--
    Occasions more rejoicing in the skies
      Than ninety-nine of the celestial list.
    You may be sure, should each desire arise
      With just zeal for the Lord, that you'll exist
    Among the happy saints for evermore;
    But you were lost and damned to Hell before!"

                        LX.

    And thus great honour to Morgante paid
      The Abbot: many days they did repose.
    One day, as with Orlando they both strayed,
      And sauntered here and there, where'er they chose,
    The Abbot showed a chamber, where arrayed
      Much armour was, and hung up certain bows;
    And one of these Morgante for a whim
    Girt on, though useless, he believed, to him.

                        LXI.

    There being a want of water in the place,
      Orlando, like a worthy brother, said,
    "Morgante, I could wish you in this case
      To go for water." "You shall be obeyed
    In all commands," was the reply, "straight ways."
      Upon his shoulder a great tub he laid,
    And went out on his way unto a fountain,
    Where he was wont to drink, below the mountain.

                        LXII.

    Arrived there, a prodigious noise he hears,
      Which suddenly along the forest spread;
    Whereat from out his quiver he prepares
      An arrow for his bow, and lifts his head;
    And lo! a monstrous herd of swine appears,
      And onward rushes with tempestuous tread,
    And to the fountain's brink precisely pours;
    So that the Giant's joined by all the boars.

                        LXIII.

    Morgante at a venture shot an arrow,
      Which pierced a pig precisely in the ear,
    And passed unto the other side quite through;
      So that the boar, defunct, lay tripped up near.
    Another, to revenge his fellow farrow,
      Against the Giant rushed in fierce career,
    And reached the passage with so swift a foot,
    Morgante was not now in time to shoot.

                        LXIV.

    Perceiving that the pig was on him close,
      He gave him such a punch upon the head[345],
    As floored him so that he no more arose,
      Smashing the very bone; and he fell dead
    Next to the other. Having seen such blows,
      The other pigs along the valley fled;
    Morgante on his neck the bucket took,
    Full from the spring, which neither swerved nor shook.

                        LXV.

    The tub was on one shoulder, and there were
      The hogs on t'other, and he brushed apace
    On to the abbey, though by no means near,
      Nor spilt one drop of water in his race.
    Orlando, seeing him so soon appear
      With the dead boars, and with that brimful vase,
    Marvelled to see his strength so very great;
    So did the Abbot, and set wide the gate.

                        LXVI.

    The monks, who saw the water fresh and good[346],
      Rejoiced, but much more to perceive the pork;
    All animals are glad at sight of food:
      They lay their breviaries to sleep, and work
    With greedy pleasure, and in such a mood,
      That the flesh needs no salt beneath their fork.
    Of rankness and of rot there is no fear,
    For all the fasts are now left in arrear.

                        LXVII.

    As though they wished to burst at once, they ate;
      And gorged so that, as if the bones had been
    In water, sorely grieved the dog and cat,
      Perceiving that they all were picked too clean.
    The Abbot, who to all did honour great,
      A few days after this convivial scene,
    Gave to Morgante a fine horse, well trained,
    Which he long time had for himself maintained.

                        LXVIII.

    The horse Morgante to a meadow led,
      To gallop, and to put him to the proof,
    Thinking that he a back of iron had,
      Or to skim eggs unbroke was light enough;
    But the horse, sinking with the pain, fell dead,
      And burst, while cold on earth lay head and hoof.
    Morgante said, "Get up, thou sulky cur!"
    And still continued pricking with the spur.

                        LXIX.

    But finally he thought fit to dismount,
      And said, "I am as light as any feather,
    And he has burst;--to this what say you, Count?"
      Orlando answered, "Like a ship's mast rather
    You seem to me, and with the truck for front:
      Let him go! Fortune wills that we together
    Should march, but you on foot Morgante still."
    To which the Giant answered," So I will.

                        LXX.

    "When there shall be occasion, you will see
      How I approve my courage in the fight."
    Orlando said, "I really think you'll be,
      If it should prove God's will, a goodly knight;
    Nor will you napping there discover me.
      But never mind your horse, though out of sight
    'Twere best to carry him into some wood,
    If but the means or way I understood."

                        LXXI.

    The Giant said, "Then carry him I will,
      Since that to carry me he was so slack--
    To render, as the gods do, good for ill;
      But lend a hand to place him on my back."
    Orlando answered, "If my counsel still
      May weigh, Morgante, do not undertake
    To lift or carry this dead courser, who,
    As you have done to him, will do to you.

                        LXXII.

    "Take care he don't revenge himself, though dead,
      As Nessus did of old beyond all cure.
    I don't know if the fact you've heard or read;
      But he will make you burst, you may be sure."
    "But help him on my back," Morgante said,
      "And you shall see what weight I can endure.
    In place, my gentle Roland, of this palfrey,
    With all the bells, I'd carry yonder belfry."

                        LXXIII.

    The Abbot said, "The steeple may do well,
      But for the bells, you've broken them, I wot."
    Morgante answered, "Let them pay in Hell
      The penalty who lie dead in yon grot;"
    And hoisting up the horse from where he fell,
      He said, "Now look if I the gout have got,
    Orlando, in the legs,--or if I have force;"--
    And then he made two gambols with the horse.

                        LXXIV.

    Morgante was like any mountain framed;
      So if he did this 'tis no prodigy;
    But secretly himself Orlando blamed,
      Because he was one of his family;
    And fearing that he might be hurt or maimed,
      Once more he bade him lay his burden by:
    "Put down, nor bear him further the desert in."
    Morgante said, "I'll carry him for certain."

                        LXXV.

    He did; and stowed him in some nook away,
      And to the abbey then returned with speed.
    Orlando said, "Why longer do we stay?
      Morgante, here is nought to do indeed."
    The Abbot by the hand he took one day,
      And said, with great respect, he had agreed
    To leave his reverence; but for this decision
    He wished to have his pardon and permission.

                        LXXVI.

    The honours they continued to receive
      Perhaps exceeded what his merits claimed:
    He said, "I mean, and quickly, to retrieve
      The lost days of time past, which may be blamed;
    Some days ago I should have asked your leave,
      Kind father, but I really was ashamed,
    And know not how to show my sentiment,
    So much I see you with our stay content.

                        LXXVII.

    "But in my heart I bear through every clime
      The Abbot, abbey, and this solitude--
    So much I love you in so short a time;
      For me, from Heaven reward you with all good
    The God so true, the eternal Lord sublime!
      Whose kingdom at the last hath open stood.
    Meantime we stand expectant of your blessing.
    And recommend us to your prayers with pressing."

                        LXXVIII.

    Now when the Abbot Count Orlando heard,
      His heart grew soft with inner tenderness,
    Such fervour in his bosom bred each word;
      And, "Cavalier," he said, "if I have less
    Courteous and kind to your great worth appeared,
      Than fits me for such gentle blood to express,
    I know I have done too little in this case;
    But blame our ignorance, and this poor place.

                        LXXIX.

    "We can indeed but honour you with masses,
      And sermons, thanksgivings, and pater-nosters,
    Hot suppers, dinners (fitting other places
      In verity much rather than the cloisters);
    But such a love for you my heart embraces,
      For thousand virtues which your bosom fosters,
    That wheresoe'er you go I too shall be,
    And, on the other part, you rest with me.

                        LXXX.

    "This may involve a seeming contradiction;
      But you I know are sage, and feel, and taste,
    And understand my speech with full conviction.
      For your just pious deeds may you be graced
    With the Lord's great reward and benediction,
      By whom you were directed to this waste:
    To His high mercy is our freedom due,
    For which we render thanks to Him and you.

                        LXXXI.

    "You saved at once our life and soul: such fear
      The Giants caused us, that the way was lost
    By which we could pursue a fit career
      In search of Jesus and the saintly Host;
    And your departure breeds such sorrow here,
      That comfortless we all are to our cost;
    But months and years you would not stay in sloth,
    Nor are you formed to wear our sober cloth,

                        LXXXII.

    "But to bear arms, and wield the lance; indeed,
      With these as much is done as with this cowl;
    In proof of which the Scripture you may read,
      This Giant up to Heaven may bear his soul
    By your compassion: now in peace proceed.
      Your state and name I seek not to unroll;
    But, if I'm asked, this answer shall be given,
    That here an angel was sent down from Heaven.

                        LXXXIII.

    "If you want armour or aught else, go in,
      Look o'er the wardrobe, and take what you choose,
    And cover with it o'er this Giant's skin."
      Orlando answered, "If there should lie loose
    Some armour, ere our journey we begin,
      Which might be turned to my companion's use,
    The gift would be acceptable to me."
    The Abbot said to him, "Come in and see."

                        LXXXIV.

    And in a certain closet, where the wall
      Was covered with old armour like a crust,
    The Abbot said to them, "I give you all."
      Morgante rummaged piecemeal from the dust
    The whole, which, save one cuirass[347], was too small,
      And that too had the mail inlaid with rust.
    They wondered how it fitted him exactly,
    Which ne'er had suited others so compactly.

                        LXXXV.

    'Twas an immeasurable Giant's, who
      By the great Milo of Agrante fell
    Before the abbey many years ago.
      The story on the wall was figured well;
    In the last moment of the abbey's foe,
      Who long had waged a war implacable:
    Precisely as the war occurred they drew him,
    And there was Milo as he overthrew him.

                        LXXXVI.

    Seeing this history, Count Orlando said
      In his own heart, "O God who in the sky
    Know'st all things! how was Milo hither led?
      Who caused the Giant in this place to die?"
    And certain letters, weeping, then he read,
      So that he could not keep his visage dry,--
    As I will tell in the ensuing story:
    From evil keep you the high King of Glory!






                         FRANCESCA OF RIMINI[348]


                        FROM THE INFERNO OF DANTE.


                             CANTO THE FIFTH.

    "The Land where I was born[349] sits by the Seas
      Upon that shore to which the Po descends,
      With all his followers, in search of peace.
    Love, which the gentle heart soon apprehends,
      Seized him for the fair person which was ta'en
      From me[350], and me even yet the mode offends.
    Love, who to none beloved to love again
      Remits, seized me with wish to please, so strong[351],
      That, as thou see'st, yet, yet it doth remain.
    Love to one death conducted us along,                               10
      But Caina[352] waits for him our life who ended:"
      These were the accents uttered by her tongue.--
    Since I first listened to these Souls offended,
      I bowed my visage, and so kept it till--
      'What think'st thou?' said the bard[353]; when I unbended,
    And recommenced: 'Alas! unto such ill
      How many sweet thoughts, what strong ecstacies,
      Led these their evil fortune to fulfill!'
    And then I turned unto their side my eyes,
      And said, 'Francesca, thy sad destinies                           20
      Have made me sorrow till the tears arise.
    But tell me, in the Season of sweet sighs,
      By what and how thy Love to Passion rose,
      So as his dim desires to recognize?'
    Then she to me: 'The greatest of all woes
      Is to remind us of our happy days[co][354]
      In misery, and that thy teacher knows.
    But if to learn our Passion's first root preys
      Upon thy spirit with such Sympathy,
      I will do even as he who weeps and says.[cp][355]                 30
    We read one day for pastime, seated nigh,
      Of Lancilot, how Love enchained him too.
      We were alone, quite unsuspiciously.
    But oft our eyes met, and our Cheeks in hue
      All o'er discoloured by that reading were;
      But one point only wholly us o'erthrew;[cq]
    When we read the long-sighed-for smile of her,[cr]
      To be thus kissed by such devoted lover,[cs]
      He, who from me can be divided ne'er,
    Kissed my mouth, trembling in the act all over:                     40
      Accursed was the book and he who wrote![356]
      That day no further leaf we did uncover.'
    While thus one Spirit told us of their lot,
      The other wept, so that with Pity's thralls
      I swooned, as if by Death I had been smote,[357]
    And fell down even as a dead body falls."[358]

                                                         _March_ 20, 1820.




                           FRANCESCA DA RIMINI.


                            DANTE, L'INFERNO.


                              CANTO QUINTO.

    'Siede la terra dove nata fui
      Sulla marina, dove il Po discende
      Per aver pace co' seguaci sui.
    Amor, che al cor gentil ratto s'apprende,
      Prese costui della bella persona
      Che mi fu tolta, e il modo ancor m' offende.
    Amor, che a nullo amato amar perdona,
      Mi prese del costui piacer si forte,
      Che, come vedi, ancor non mi abbandona.
    Amor condusse noi ad una morte:                                     10
      Caino attende chi vita ci spense.'
      Queste parole da lor ci fur porte.
    Da che io intesi quelle anime offense
      Chinai 'l viso, e tanto il tenni basso,
      Finche il Poeta mi disse: 'Che pense?'
    Quando risposi, cominciai: 'O lasso!
      Quanti dolci pensier, quanto disio
      Meno costoro al doloroso passo!'
    Poi mi rivolsi a loro, e parla' io,
      E cominciai: 'Francesca, i tuoi martiri                           20
      A lagrimar mi fanno tristo e pio.
    Ma dimmi: al tempo de' dolci sospiri
      A che e come concedette Amore,
      Che conoscesti i dubbiosi desiri?'
    Ed ella a me: 'Nessun maggior dolore
      Che ricordarsi del tempo felice
      Nella miseria; e cio sa il tuo dottore.
    Ma se a conoscer la prima radice
      Del nostro amor tu hai cotanto affetto
      Faro come colui che piange e dice.                                30
    Noi leggevamo un giorno per diletto
      Di Lancelotto, come Amor lo strinse:
      Soli eravamo, e senza alcun sospetto.
    Per piu fiate gli occhi ci sospinse
      Quella lettura, e scolorocci il viso:
      Ma solo un punto fu quel che ci vinse.
    Quando leggemmo il disiato riso
      Esser baciato da cotanto amante,
      Questi, che mai da me non fia diviso,
    La bocca mi bacio tutto tremante:                                   40
      Galeotto fu il libro, e chi lo scrisse--
      Quel giorno piu non vi leggemmo avante
    Mentre che l'uno spirto questo disse,
      L'altro piangeva si che di pietade
      Io venni meno cos com' io morisse;
    E caddi, come corpo morto cade.

                     MARINO FALIERO, DOGE OF VENICE.


                  (AN HISTORICAL TRAGEDY IN FIVE ACTS.)




                                  ACT I.


             SCENE I.--_An Antechamber in the Ducal Palace_.

                PIETRO _speaks, in entering, to_ BATTISTA.

    _Pie_. Is not the messenger returned?[cv]

    _Bat_.                                   Not yet;
    I have sent frequently, as you commanded,
    But still the Signory[380] is deep in council,
    And long debate on Steno's accusation.

    _Pie_. Too long--at least so thinks the Doge.

    _Bat_.                                       How bears he
    These moments of suspense?

    _Pie_.                    With struggling patience.[cw]
    Placed at the Ducal table, covered o'er
    With all the apparel of the state--petitions,
    Despatches, judgments, acts, reprieves, reports,--
    He sits as rapt in duty; but whene'er[cx]                           10
    He hears the jarring of a distant door,
    Or aught that intimates a coming step,[cy]
    Or murmur of a voice, his quick eye wanders,
    And he will start up from his chair, then pause,
    And seat himself again, and fix his gaze
    Upon some edict; but I have observed
    For the last hour he has not turned a leaf.

    _Bat_. 'Tis said he is much moved,--and doubtless 'twas
    Foul scorn in Steno to offend so grossly.

    _Pie_. Aye, if a poor man: Steno's a patrician,                     20
    Young, galliard, gay, and haughty.[cz]

    _Bat_.                                Then you think
    He will not be judged hardly?

    _Pie_.                       'Twere enough
    He be judged justly; but 'tis not for us
    To anticipate the sentence of the Forty.

    _Bat_. And here it comes.--What news, Vincenzo?

                                _Enter_ VINCENZO.

    _Vin_.                                           'Tis
    Decided; but as yet his doom's unknown:
    I saw the President in act to seal
    The parchment which will bear the Forty's judgment
    Unto the Doge, and hasten to inform him.
    [_Exeunt_.


                      SCENE II.--The Ducal Chamber.

     MARINO FALIERO, _Doge; and his Nephew_, BERTUCCIO FALIERO.[381]

    _Ber. F._ It cannot be but they will do you justice.

    _Doge_. Aye, such as the Avogadori[382] did,
    Who sent up my appeal unto the Forty
    To try him by his peers, his own tribunal.

    _Ber. F._ His peers will scarce protect him; such an act
    Would bring contempt on all authority.

    _Doge_. Know you not Venice? Know you not the Forty?
    But we shall see anon.

    _Ber. F._ (_addressing_ VINCENZO, _then entering_.)
                           How now--what tidings?

    _Vin_. I am charged to tell his Highness that the court
    Has passed its resolution, and that, soon                           10
    As the due forms of judgment are gone through,
    The sentence will be sent up to the Doge;
    In the mean time the Forty doth salute
    The Prince of the Republic, and entreat
    His acceptation of their duty.

    _Doge_.                       Yes--
    They are wond'rous dutiful, and ever humble.
    Sentence is passed, you say?

    _Vin_.                      It is, your Highness:
    The President was sealing it, when I
    Was called in, that no moment might be lost
    In forwarding the intimation due                                    20
    Not only to the Chief of the Republic,
    But the complainant, both in one united.

    _Ber. F._ Are you aware, from aught you have perceived,
    Of their decision?

    _Vin_.            No, my Lord; you know
    The secret custom of the courts in Venice.

    _Ber. F._ True; but there still is something given to guess,
    Which a shrewd gleaner and quick eye would catch at;
    A whisper, or a murmur, or an air
    More or less solemn spread o'er the tribunal.
    The Forty are but men--most worthy men,                             30
    And wise, and just, and cautious--this I grant--
    And secret as the grave to which they doom
    The guilty: but with all this, in their aspects--
    At least in some, the juniors of the number--
    A searching eye, an eye like yours, Vincenzo,
    Would read the sentence ere it was pronounced.

    _Vin_. My Lord, I came away upon the moment,
    And had no leisure to take note of that
    Which passed among the judges, even in seeming;
    My station near the accused too, Michel Steno,                      40
    Made me--

    _Doge_ (_abruptly_). And how looked _he_? deliver that.

    _Vin_. Calm, but not overcast, he stood resigned
    To the decree, whate'er it were;--but lo!
    It comes, for the perusal of his Highness.

                  _Enter the_ SECRETARY _of the Forty_.

    _Sec_. The high tribunal of the Forty sends
    Health and respect to the Doge Faliero,[da]
    Chief magistrate of Venice, and requests
    His Highness to peruse and to approve
    The sentence passed on Michel Steno, born
    Patrician, and arraigned upon the charge                            50
    Contained, together with its penalty,
    Within the rescript which I now present.

    _Doge_. Retire, and wait without.
    [_Exeunt_ SECRETARY _and_ VINCENZO.]
                                               Take thou this paper:
    The misty letters vanish from my eyes;
    I cannot fix them.

    _Ber. F._          Patience, my dear Uncle:
    Why do you tremble thus?--nay, doubt not, all
    Will be as could be wished.

    _Doge_.                    Say on.

    _Ber. F._ (_reading_).           "Decreed
    In council, without one dissenting voice,
    That Michel Steno, by his own confession,
    Guilty on the last night of Carnival                                60
    Of having graven on the ducal throne
    The following words--"[383]

    _Doge_.                Would'st thou repeat them?
    Would'st _thou_ repeat them--_thou_, a Faliero,
    Harp on the deep dishonour of our house,
    Dishonoured in its Chief--that Chief the Prince
    Of Venice, first of cities?--To the sentence.

    _Ber. F._ Forgive me, my good Lord; I will obey--
    (_Reads_) "That Michel Steno be detained a month
    In close arrest."[384]

    _Doge_.             Proceed.

    _Ber. F._                  My Lord, 'tis finished.

    _Doge_. How say you?--finished! Do I dream?--'tis false--           70
    Give me the paper--(_snatches the paper and reads_)--
                      "'Tis decreed in council
    That Michel Steno"--Nephew, thine arm!

    _Ber. F._                          Nay,
    Cheer up, be calm; this transport is uncalled for--
    Let me seek some assistance.

    _Doge_.                     Stop, sir--Stir not--
    'Tis past.

    _Ber. F._   I cannot but agree with you
    The sentence is too slight for the offence;
    It is not honourable in the Forty
    To affix so slight a penalty to that
    Which was a foul affront to you, and even
    To them, as being your subjects; but 'tis not                       80
    Yet without remedy: you can appeal
    To them once more, or to the Avogadori,
    Who, seeing that true justice is withheld,
    Will now take up the cause they once declined,
    And do you right upon the bold delinquent.
    Think you not thus, good Uncle? why do you stand
    So fixed? You heed me not:--I pray you, hear me!

    _Doge_ (_dashing down the ducal bonnet, and offering to
    trample upon it, exclaims, as he is withheld by his nephew_).
    Oh! that the Saracen were in St. Mark's!
    Thus would I do him homage.

    _Ber. F._                  For the sake
    Of Heaven and all its saints, my Lord--

    _Doge_.                                Away!                        90
    Oh, that the Genoese were in the port!
    Oh, that the Huns whom I o'erthrew at Zara[385]
    Were ranged around the palace!

    _Ber. F._                      'Tis not well
    In Venice' Duke to say so.

    _Doge_.                   Venice' Duke!
    Who now is Duke in Venice? let me see him,
    That he may do me right.

    _Ber. F._               If you forget
    Your office, and its dignity and duty.
    Remember that of man, and curb this passion.
    The Duke of Venice----

    _Doge_ (_interrupting him_). There is no such thing--
    It is a word--nay, worse--a worthless by-word:                     100
    The most despised, wronged, outraged, helpless wretch,
    Who begs his bread, if 'tis refused by one,
    May win it from another kinder heart;
    But he, who is denied his right by those
    Whose place it is to do no wrong, is poorer
    Than the rejected beggar--he's a slave--
    And that am I--and thou--and all our house,
    Even from this hour; the meanest artisan
    Will point the finger, and the haughty noble
    May spit upon us:--where is our redress?                           110

    _Ber. F._ The law, my Prince--

    _Doge_ (_interrupting him_). You see what it has done;
    I asked no remedy but from the law--[386]
    I sought no vengeance but redress by law--
    I called no judges but those named by law--
    As Sovereign, I appealed unto my subjects,
    The very subjects who had made me Sovereign,
    And gave me thus a double right to be so.
    The rights of place and choice, of birth and service,
    Honours and years, these scars, these hoary hairs,
    The travel--toil--the perils--the fatigues--                       120
    The blood and sweat of almost eighty years,
    Were weighed i' the balance, 'gainst the foulest stain,
    The grossest insult, most contemptuous crime
    Of a rank, rash patrician--and found wanting!
    And this is to be borne!

    _Ber. F._                I say not that:--
    In case your fresh appeal should be rejected,
    We will find other means to make all even.

    _Doge_. Appeal again! art thou my brother's son?
    A scion of the house of Faliero?
    The nephew of a Doge? and of that blood                            130
    Which hath already given three dukes to Venice?
    But thou say'st well--we must be humble now.

    _Ber. F._ My princely Uncle! you are too much moved;--
    I grant it was a gross offence, and grossly
    Left without fitting punishment: but still
    This fury doth exceed the provocation,
    Or any provocation: if we are wronged,
    We will ask justice; if it be denied,
    We'll take it; but may do all this in calmness--
    Deep Vengeance is the daughter of deep Silence.                    140
    I have yet scarce a third part of your years,
    I love our house, I honour you, its Chief,
    The guardian of my youth, and its instructor--
    But though I understand your grief, and enter
    In part of your disdain, it doth appal me
    To see your anger, like our Adrian waves,
    O'ersweep all bounds, and foam itself to air.

    _Doge_. I tell thee--_must_ I tell thee--what thy father
    Would have required no words to comprehend?
    Hast thou no feeling save the external sense                       150
    Of torture from the touch? hast thou no soul--
    No pride--no passion--no deep sense of honour?

    _Ber. F._ 'Tis the first time that honour has been doubted,
    And were the last, from any other sceptic.

    _Doge_. You know the full offence of this born villain,
    This creeping, coward, rank, acquitted felon,
    Who threw his sting into a poisonous libel,[db]
    And on the honour of--Oh God! my wife,
    The nearest, dearest part of all men's honour,
    Left a base slur to pass from mouth to mouth                       160
    Of loose mechanics, with all coarse foul comments,
    And villainous jests, and blasphemies obscene;
    While sneering nobles, in more polished guise,
    Whispered the tale, and smiled upon the lie
    Which made me look like them--a courteous wittol,
    Patient--aye--proud, it may be, of dishonour.

    _Ber. F._ But still it was a lie--you knew it false,
    And so did all men.

    _Doge_.             Nephew, the high Roman
    Said, "Caesar's wife must not even be suspected,"[387]
    And put her from him.

    _Ber. F._             True--but in those days----                  170

    _Doge_. What is it that a Roman would not suffer,
    That a Venetian Prince must bear? old Dandolo[dc]
    Refused the diadem of all the Caesars,[388]
    And wore the ducal cap _I_ trample on--
    Because 'tis now degraded.

    _Ber. F._                  'Tis even so.

    _Doge_. It is--it is;--I did not visit on
    The innocent creature thus most vilely slandered
    Because she took an old man for her lord,
    For that he had been long her father's friend
    And patron of her house, as if there were                          180
    No love in woman's heart but lust of youth
    And beardless faces;--I did not for this
    Visit the villain's infamy on her,
    But craved my country's justice on his head,
    The justice due unto the humblest being
    Who hath a wife whose faith is sweet to him,
    Who hath a home whose hearth is dear to him--
    Who hath a name whose honour's all to him,
    When these are tainted by the accursing breath
    Of Calumny and Scorn.

    _Ber. F._             And what redress                             190
    Did you expect as his fit punishment?

    _Doge_. Death! Was I not the Sovereign of the state--
    Insulted on his very throne, and made
    A mockery to the men who should obey me?
    Was I not injured as a husband? scorned
    As man? reviled, degraded, as a Prince?
    Was not offence like his a complication
    Of insult and of treason?--and he lives!
    Had he instead of on the Doge's throne
    Stamped the same brand upon a peasant's stool,                     200
    His blood had gilt the threshold; for the carle
    Had stabbed him on the instant.

    _Ber. F._                      Do not doubt it,
    He shall not live till sunset--leave to me
    The means, and calm yourself.

    _Doge_.                       Hold, nephew: this
    Would have sufficed but yesterday; at present
    I have no further wrath against this man.

    _Ber. F._ What mean you? is not the offence redoubled
    By this most rank--I will not say--acquittal;
    For it is worse, being full acknowledgment
    Of the offence, and leaving it unpunished?                         210

    _Doge_. It is _redoubled_, but not now by him:
    The Forty hath decreed a month's arrest--
    We must obey the Forty.

    _Ber. F._               Obey _them_!
    Who have forgot their duty to the Sovereign?

    _Doge_. Why, yes;--boy, you perceive it then at last;
    Whether as fellow citizen who sues
    For justice, or as Sovereign who commands it,
    They have defrauded me of both my rights
    (For here the Sovereign is a citizen);
    But, notwithstanding, harm not thou a hair                         220
    Of Steno's head--he shall not wear it long.

    _Ber. F._ Not twelve hours longer, had you left to me
    The mode and means; if you had calmly heard me,
    I never meant this miscreant should escape,
    But wished you to suppress such gusts of passion,
    That we more surely might devise together
    His taking off.

    _Doge_.         No, nephew, he must live;
    At least, just now--a life so vile as his
    Were nothing at this hour; in th' olden time[dd]
    Some sacrifices asked a single victim,                             230
    Great expiations had a hecatomb.

    _Ber. F._ Your wishes are my law: and yet I fain
    Would prove to you how near unto my heart
    The honour of our house must ever be.

    _Doge_. Fear not; you shall have time and place of proof:
    But be not thou too rash, as I have been.
    I am ashamed of my own anger now;
    I pray you, pardon me.

    _Ber. F._              Why, that's my uncle!
    The leader, and the statesman, and the chief
    Of commonwealths, and sovereign of himself!                        240
    I wondered to perceive you so forget
    All prudence in your fury at these years,
    Although the cause--

    _Doge_.              Aye--think upon the cause--
    Forget it not:--When you lie down to rest,
    Let it be black among your dreams; and when
    The morn returns, so let it stand between
    The Sun and you, as an ill-omened cloud
    Upon a summer-day of festival:
    So will it stand to me;--but speak not, stir not,--
    Leave all to me; we shall have much to do,                         250
    And you shall have a part.--But now retire,
    'Tis fit I were alone.

    _Ber. F._ (_taking up and placing the ducal bonnet on the table_).
                           Ere I depart,
    I pray you to resume what you have spurned,
    Till you can change it--haply, for a crown!
    And now I take my leave, imploring you
    In all things to rely upon my duty,
    As doth become your near and faithful kinsman,
    And not less loyal citizen and subject.
                                                  [Exit BERTUCCIO FALIERO.

    _Doge_ (_solus_). Adieu, my worthy nephew.--Hollow bauble!
                                               [_Taking up the ducal cap_.
    Beset with all the thorns that line a crown,                       260
    Without investing the insulted brow
    With the all-swaying majesty of Kings;
    Thou idle, gilded, and degraded toy,
    Let me resume thee as I would a vizor.                  [_Puts it on_.
    How my brain aches beneath thee! and my temples
    Throb feverish under thy dishonest weight.
    Could I not turn thee to a diadem?
    Could I not shatter the Briarean sceptre
    Which in this hundred-handed Senate rules,
    Making the people nothing, and the Prince                          270
    A pageant? In my life I have achieved
    Tasks not less difficult--achieved for them,
    Who thus repay me! Can I not requite them?
    Oh for one year! Oh! but for even a day
    Of my full youth, while yet my body served
    My soul as serves the generous steed his lord,
    I would have dashed amongst them, asking few
    In aid to overthrow these swoln patricians;
    But now I must look round for other hands
    To serve this hoary head; but it shall plan                        280
    In such a sort as will not leave the task
    Herculean, though as yet 'tis but a chaos
    Of darkly brooding thoughts: my fancy is
    In her first work, more nearly to the light
    Holding the sleeping images of things
    For the selection of the pausing judgment.--
    The troops are few in----

                            _Enter_ VINCENZO.

    _Vin_.                     There is one without
    Craves audience of your Highness.

    _Doge_.                           I'm unwell--
    I can see no one, not even a patrician--
    Let him refer his business to the Council.                         290

    _Vin_. My Lord, I will deliver your reply;
    It cannot much import--he's a plebeian,
    The master of a galley, I believe.

    _Doge_. How! did you say the patron of a galley?[389]
    That is--I mean--a servant of the state:
    Admit him, he may be on public service.
                                                         [_Exit_ VINCENZO.

    _Doge_ (_solus_). This patron may be sounded; I will try him.
    I know the people to be discontented:
    They have cause, since Sapienza's[390] adverse day,
    When Genoa conquered: they have further cause,                     300
    Since they are nothing in the state, and in
    The city worse than nothing--mere machines,
    To serve the nobles' most patrician pleasure.
    The troops have long arrears of pay, oft promised,
    And murmur deeply--any hope of change
    Will draw them forward: they shall pay themselves
    With plunder:--but the priests--I doubt the priesthood
    Will not be with us; they have hated me
    Since that rash hour, when, maddened with the drone,
    I smote the tardy Bishop at Treviso,[391]                          310
    Quickening his holy march; yet, ne'ertheless,
    They may be won, at least their Chief at Rome,
    By some well-timed concessions; but, above
    All things, I must be speedy: at my hour
    Of twilight little light of life remains.
    Could I free Venice, and avenge my wrongs,
    I had lived too long, and willingly would sleep
    Next moment with my sires; and, wanting this,
    Better that sixty of my fourscore years
    Had been already where--how soon, I care not--                     320
    The whole must be extinguished;--better that
    They ne'er had been, than drag me on to be
    The thing these arch-oppressors fain would make me.
    Let me consider--of efficient troops
    There are three thousand posted at----

                 _Enter_ VINCENZO _and_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO.

    _Vin_.                                 May it please
    Your Highness, the same patron whom I spake of
    Is here to crave your patience.

    _Doge_.                        Leave the chamber,
    Vincenzo.--
                                                         [_Exit_ VINCENZO.
                Sir, you may advance--what would you?

    _I. Ber_.  Redress.

    _Doge_.             Of whom?

    _I. Ber_.                    Of God and of the Doge.

    _Doge_. Alas! my friend, you seek it of the twain                  330
    Of least respect and interest in Venice.
    You must address the Council.

    _I. Ber_.                    'Twere in vain;
    For he who injured me is one of them.

    _Doge_. There's blood upon thy face--how came it there?

    _I. Ber_. 'Tis mine, and not the first I've shed for Venice,
    But the first shed by a Venetian hand:
    A noble smote me.

    _Doge_.          Doth he live?

    _I. Ber_.                     Not long--
    But for the hope I had and have, that you,
    My Prince, yourself a soldier, will redress
    Him, whom the laws of discipline and Venice                        340
    Permit not to protect himself:--if not--
    I say no more.

    _Doge_.        But something you would do--
    Is it not so?

    _I. Ber_.     I am a man, my Lord.

    _Doge_. Why so is he who smote you.

    _I. Ber_.                          He is called so;
    Nay, more, a noble one--at least, in Venice:
    But since he hath forgotten that I am one,
    And treats me like a brute, the brute may turn--
    'Tis said the worm will.

    _Doge_.                 Say--his name and lineage?

    _I. Ber_. Barbaro.

    _Doge_.           What was the cause? or the pretext?

    _I. Ber_. I am the chief of the arsenal,[392] employed             350
    At present in repairing certain galleys
    But roughly used by the Genoese last year.
    This morning comes the noble Barbaro[393]
    Full of reproof, because our artisans
    Had left some frivolous order of his house,
    To execute the state's decree: I dared
    To justify the men--he raised his hand;--
    Behold my blood! the first time it e'er flowed
    Dishonourably.

    _Doge_.        Have you long time served?

    _I. Ber_. So long as to remember Zara's siege,                     360
    And fight beneath the Chief who beat the Huns there,
    Sometime my general, now the Doge Faliero.--

    _Doge_. How! are we comrades?--the State's ducal robes
    Sit newly on me, and you were appointed
    Chief of the arsenal ere I came from Rome;
    So that I recognised you not. Who placed you?

    _I. Ber_. The late Doge; keeping still my old command
    As patron of a galley: my new office
    Was given as the reward of certain scars
    (So was your predecessor pleased to say):                          370
    I little thought his bounty would conduct me
    To his successor as a helpless plaintiff;
    At least, in such a cause.

    _Doge_.                   Are you much hurt?

    _I. Ber_. Irreparably in my self-esteem.

    _Doge_. Speak out; fear nothing: being stung at heart,
    What would you do to be revenged on this man?

    _I. Ber_. That which I dare not name, and yet will do.

    _Doge_. Then wherefore came you here?

    _I. Ber_.                             I come for justice,
    Because my general is Doge, and will not
    See his old soldier trampled on. Had any,                          380
    Save Faliero, filled the ducal throne,
    This blood had been washed out in other blood.

    _Doge_. You come to me for justice--unto _me!_
    The Doge of Venice, and I cannot give it;
    I cannot even obtain it--'twas denied
    To me most solemnly an hour ago!

    _I. Ber_. How says your Highness?

    _Doge_.                           Steno is condemned
    To a month's confinement.

    _I. Ber_.                 What! the same who dared
    To stain the ducal throne with those foul words,
    That have cried shame to every ear in Venice?                      390

    _Doge_. Aye, doubtless they have echoed o'er the arsenal,
    Keeping due time with every hammer's clink,
    As a good jest to jolly artisans;
    Or making chorus to the creaking oar,
    In the vile tune of every galley-slave,
    Who, as he sung the merry stave, exulted
    _He_ was not a shamed dotard like the Doge.

    _I. Ber_. Is't possible? a month's imprisonment!
    No more for Steno?

    _Doge_.           You have heard the offence,
    And now you know his punishment; and then                          400
    You ask redress of _me_! Go to the Forty,
    Who passed the sentence upon Michel Steno;
    They'll do as much by Barbaro, no doubt.

    _I. Ber_. Ah! dared I speak my feelings!

    _Doge_.                                 Give them breath.
    Mine have no further outrage to endure.

    _I. Ber_. Then, in a word, it rests but on your word
    To punish and avenge--I will not say
    _My_ petty wrong, for what is a mere blow,
    However vile, to such a thing as I am?--
    But the base insult done your state and person.                    410

    _Doge_. You overrate my power, which is a pageant.
    This Cap is not the Monarch's crown; these robes
    Might move compassion, like a beggar's rags;
    Nay, more, a beggar's are his own, and these
    But lent to the poor puppet, who must play
    Its part with all its empire in this ermine.

    _I. Ber_. Wouldst thou be King?

    _Doge_.                        Yes--of a happy people.

    _I. Ber_. Wouldst thou be sovereign lord of Venice?

    _Doge_.                                            Aye,
    If that the people shared that sovereignty,
    So that nor they nor I were further slaves                         420
    To this o'ergrown aristocratic Hydra,[394]
    The poisonous heads of whose envenomed body
    Have breathed a pestilence upon us all.

    _I. Ber_. Yet, thou wast born, and still hast lived, patrician.

    _Doge_. In evil hour was I so born; my birth
    Hath made me Doge to be insulted: but
    I lived and toiled a soldier and a servant
    Of Venice and her people, not the Senate;
    Their good and my own honour were my guerdon.
    I have fought and bled; commanded, aye, and conquered;             430
    Have made and marred peace oft in embassies,
    As it might chance to be our country's 'vantage;
    Have traversed land and sea in constant duty,
    Through almost sixty years, and still for Venice,
    My fathers' and my birthplace, whose dear spires,
    Rising at distance o'er the blue Lagoon,
    It was reward enough for me to view
    Once more; but not for any knot of men,
    Nor sect, nor faction, did I bleed or sweat!
    But would you know why I have done all this?                       440
    Ask of the bleeding pelican why she
    Hath ripped her bosom? Had the bird a voice,
    She'd tell thee 'twas for _all_ her little ones.

    _I. Ber_. And yet they made thee Duke.

    _Doge_.                           _They made_ me so;
    I sought it not, the flattering fetters met me
    Returning from my Roman embassy,
    And never having hitherto refused
    Toil, charge, or duty for the state, I did not,
    At these late years, decline what was the highest
    Of all in seeming, but of all most base                            450
    In what we have to do and to endure:
    Bear witness for me thou, my injured subject,
    When I can neither right myself nor thee.

    _I. Ber_. You shall do both, if you possess the will;
    And many thousands more not less oppressed,
    Who wait but for a signal--will you give it?

    _Doge_. You speak in riddles.

    _I. Ber_.                     Which shall soon be read
    At peril of my life--if you disdain not
    To lend a patient ear.

    _Doge_.               Say on.

    _I. Ber_.                       Not thou,
    Nor I alone, are injured and abused,                               460
    Contemned and trampled on; but the whole people
    Groan with the strong conception of their wrongs:
    The foreign soldiers in the Senate's pay
    Are discontented for their long arrears;
    The native mariners, and civic troops,
    Feel with their friends; for who is he amongst them
    Whose brethren, parents, children, wives, or sisters,
    Have not partook[395] oppression, or pollution,
    From the patricians? And the hopeless war
    Against the Genoese, which is still maintained                     470
    With the plebeian blood, and treasure wrung
    From their hard earnings, has inflamed them further:
    Even now--but, I forget that speaking thus,
    Perhaps I pass the sentence of my death!

    _Doge_. And suffering what thou hast done--fear'st thou death?
    Be silent then, and live on, to be beaten
    By those for whom thou hast bled.

    _I. Ber_.                       No, I will speak
    At every hazard; and if Venice' Doge
    Should turn delator, be the shame on him,
    And sorrow too; for he will lose far more                          480
    Than I.

    _Doge_. From me fear nothing; out with it!

    _I. Ber_. Know then, that there are met and sworn in secret
    A band of brethren, valiant hearts and true;
    Men who have proved all fortunes, and have long
    Grieved over that of Venice, and have right
    To do so; having served her in all climes,
    And having rescued her from foreign foes,
    Would do the same from those within her walls.
    They are not numerous, nor yet too few
    For their great purpose; they have arms, and means,                490
    And hearts, and hopes, and faith, and patient courage.

    _Doge_. For what then do they pause?

    _I. Ber_.                           An hour to strike.

    _Doge_ (_aside_). Saint Mark's shall strike that hour![396]

    _I. Ber_.                                    I now have placed
    My life, my honour, all my earthly hopes
    Within thy power, but in the firm belief
    That injuries like ours, sprung from one cause,
    Will generate one vengeance: should it be so,
    Be our Chief now--our Sovereign hereafter.

    _Doge_. How many are ye?

    _I. Ber_.               I'll not answer that
    Till I am answered.

    _Doge_.            How, sir! do you menace?                        500

    _I. Ber_. No; I affirm. I have betrayed myself;
    But there's no torture in the mystic wells
    Which undermine your palace, nor in those
    Not less appalling cells, the "leaden roofs,"
    To force a single name from me of others.
    The Pozzi[397] and the Piombi were in vain;
    They might wring blood from me, but treachery never.
    And I would pass the fearful "Bridge of Sighs,"
    Joyous that mine must be the last that e'er
    Would echo o'er the Stygian wave which flows                       510
    Between the murderers and the murdered, washing
    The prison and the palace walls: there are
    Those who would live to think on't, and avenge me.

    _Doge_. If such your power and purpose, why come here
    To sue for justice, being in the course
    To do yourself due right?

    _I. Ber_.                 Because the man,
    Who claims protection from authority,
    Showing his confidence and his submission
    To that authority, can hardly be
    Suspected of combining to destroy it.                              520
    Had I sate down too humbly with this blow,
    A moody brow and muttered threats had made me
    A marked man to the Forty's inquisition;
    But loud complaint, however angrily
    It shapes its phrase, is little to be feared,
    And less distrusted. But, besides all this,
    I had another reason.

    _Doge_.              What was that?

    _I. Ber_. Some rumours that the Doge was greatly moved
    By the reference of the Avogadori
    Of Michel Steno's sentence to the Forty                            530
    Had reached me. I had served you, honoured you,
    And felt that you were dangerously insulted,
    Being of an order of such spirits, as
    Requite tenfold both good and evil: 'twas
    My wish to prove and urge you to redress.
    Now you know all; and that I speak the truth,
    My peril be the proof.

    _Doge_.                 You have deeply ventured;
    But all must do so who would greatly win:
    Thus far I'll answer you--your secret's safe.

    _I. Ber_. And is this all?

    _Doge_.                   Unless with all intrusted,               540
    What would you have me answer?

    _I. Ber_.                     I would have you
    Trust him who leaves his life in trust with you.

    _Doge_. But I must know your plan, your names, and numbers;
    The last may then be doubled, and the former
    Matured and strengthened.

    _I. Ber_.                We're enough already;
    You are the sole ally we covet now.

    _Doge_. But bring me to the knowledge of your chiefs.

    _I. Ber_. That shall be done upon your formal pledge
    To keep the faith that we will pledge to you.

    _Doge_. When? where?

    _I. Ber_.           This night I'll bring to your apartment        550
    Two of the principals: a greater number
    Were hazardous.

    _Doge_.        Stay, I must think of this.--
    What if I were to trust myself amongst you,
    And leave the palace?

    _I. Ber_.            You must come alone.

    _Doge_. With but my nephew.

    _I. Ber_.                  Not were he your son!

    _Doge_. Wretch! darest thou name my son? He died in arms
    At Sapienza[398] for this faithless state.
    Oh! that he were alive, and I in ashes!
    Or that he were alive ere I be ashes!
    I should not need the dubious aid of strangers.                    560

    _I. Ber_. Not one of all those strangers whom thou doubtest,
    But will regard thee with a filial feeling,
    So that thou keep'st a father's faith with them.

    _Doge_. The die is cast. Where is the place of meeting?

    _I. Ber_. At midnight I will be alone and masked
    Where'er your Highness pleases to direct me,
    To wait your coming, and conduct you where
    You shall receive our homage, and pronounce
    Upon our project.

    _Doge_.           At what hour arises
    The moon?

    _I. Ber_.  Late, but the atmosphere is thick and dusky,          570
    'Tis a sirocco.

    _Doge_.           At the midnight hour, then,
    Near to the church where sleep my sires;[399] the same,
    Twin-named from the apostles John and Paul;
    A gondola,[400] with one oar only, will
    Lurk in the narrow channel which glides by.
    Be there.

    _I. Ber_. I will not fail.

    _Doge_.                     And now retire----

    _I. Ber_. In the full hope your Highness will not falter
    In your great purpose. Prince, I take my leave.
                                                 [_Exit_ Isreal Bertuccio.

    _Doge_ (_solus_). At midnight, by the church Saints John and Paul,
    Where sleep my noble fathers, I repair--                           580
    To what? to hold a council in the dark
    With common ruffians leagued to ruin states!
    And will not my great sires leap from the vault,
    Where lie two Doges who preceded me,
    And pluck me down amongst them? Would they could!
    For I should rest in honour with the honoured.
    Alas! I must not think of them, but those
    Who have made me thus unworthy of a name
    Noble and brave as aught of consular
    On Roman marbles; but I will redeem it                             590
    Back to its antique lustre in our annals,
    By sweet revenge on all that's base in Venice,
    And freedom to the rest, or leave it black
    To all the growing calumnies of Time,
    Which never spare the fame of him who fails,
    But try the Caesar, or the Catiline,
    By the true touchstone of desert--Success.[401]




                                 ACT II.


              SCENE I.--_An Apartment in the Ducal Palace_.

           ANGIOLINA[402] (_wife of the_ DOGE) _and_ MARIANNA.

    _Ang_. What was the Doge's answer?

    _Mar_.                            That he was
    That moment summoned to a conference;
    But 'tis by this time ended. I perceived
    Not long ago the Senators embarking;
    And the last gondola may now be seen
    Gliding into the throng of barks which stud
    The glittering waters.

    _Ang_.                Would he were returned!
    He has been much disquieted of late;
    And Time, which has not tamed his fiery spirit,
    Nor yet enfeebled even his mortal frame,                            10
    Which seems to be more nourished by a soul
    So quick and restless that it would consume
    Less hardy clay--Time has but little power
    On his resentments or his griefs. Unlike
    To other spirits of his order, who,
    In the first burst of passion, pour away
    Their wrath or sorrow, all things wear in him
    An aspect of Eternity: his thoughts,
    His feelings, passions, good or evil, all
    Have nothing of old age;[403] and his bold brow                     20
    Bears but the scars of mind, the thoughts of years,
    Not their decrepitude: and he of late
    Has been more agitated than his wont.
    Would he were come! for I alone have power
    Upon his troubled spirit.

    _Mar_.                    It is true,
    His Highness has of late been greatly moved
    By the affront of Steno, and with cause:
    But the offender doubtless even now
    Is doomed to expiate his rash insult with
    Such chastisement as will enforce respect                           30
    To female virtue, and to noble blood.

    _Ang_. 'Twas a gross insult; but I heed it not
    For the rash scorner's falsehood in itself,
    But for the effect, the deadly deep impression
    Which it has made upon Faliero's soul,
    The proud, the fiery, the austere--austere
    To all save me: I tremble when I think
    To what it may conduct.

    _Mar_.                  Assuredly
    The Doge can not suspect you?

    _Ang_.                        Suspect _me!_
    Why Steno dared not: when he scrawled his lie,                      40
    Grovelling by stealth in the moon's glimmering light,
    His own still conscience smote him for the act,
    And every shadow on the walls frowned shame
    Upon his coward calumny.

    _Mar_.                   'Twere fit
    He should be punished grievously.

    _Ang_.                            He is so.

    _Mar_. What! is the sentence passed? is he condemned?[de]

    _Ang_. I know not that, but he has been detected.

    _Mar_. And deem you this enough for such foul scorn?

    _Ang_. I would not be a judge in my own cause,
    Nor do I know what sense of punishment                              50
    May reach the soul of ribalds such as Steno;
    But if his insults sink no deeper in
    The minds of the inquisitors than they
    Have ruffled mine, he will, for all acquittance,
    Be left to his own shamelessness or shame.

    _Mar_. Some sacrifice is due to slandered virtue.

    _Ang_. Why, what is virtue if it needs a victim?
    Or if it must depend upon men's words?
    The dying Roman said, "'twas but a name:"[404]
    It were indeed no more, if human breath                             60
    Could make or mar it.

    _Mar_.                Yet full many a dame,
    Stainless and faithful, would feel all the wrong
    Of such a slander; and less rigid ladies,
    Such as abound in Venice, would be loud
    And all-inexorable in their cry
    For justice.

    _Ang_.       This but proves it is the name
    And not the quality they prize: the first
    Have found it a hard task to hold their honour,
    If they require it to be blazoned forth;
    And those who have not kept it, seek its seeming                    70
    As they would look out for an ornament
    Of which they feel the want, but not because
    They think it so; they live in others' thoughts,
    And would seem honest as they must seem fair.

    _Mar_. You have strange thoughts for a patrician dame.

    _Ang_. And yet they were my father's; with his name,
    The sole inheritance he left.

    _Mar_.                        You want none;
    Wife to a Prince, the Chief of the Republic.

    _Ang_. I should have sought none though a peasant's bride,
    But feel not less the love and gratitude                            80
    Due to my father, who bestowed my hand
    Upon his early, tried, and trusted friend,
    The Count Val di Marino, now our Doge.

    _Mar_. And with that hand did he bestow your heart?

    _Ang_. He did so, or it had not been bestowed.

    _Mar_. Yet this strange disproportion in your years,
    And, let me add, disparity of tempers,
    Might make the world doubt whether such an union
    Could make you wisely, permanently happy.

    _Ang_. The world will think with worldlings; but my heart           90
    Has still been in my duties, which are many,
    But never difficult.

    _Mar_.               And do you love him?

    _Ang_. I love all noble qualities which merit
    Love, and I loved my father, who first taught me
    To single out what we should love in others,
    And to subdue all tendency to lend
    The best and purest feelings of our nature
    To baser passions. He bestowed my hand
    Upon Faliero: he had known him noble,
    Brave, generous; rich in all the qualities                         100
    Of soldier, citizen, and friend; in all
    Such have I found him as my father said.
    His faults are those that dwell in the high bosoms
    Of men who have commanded; too much pride,
    And the deep passions fiercely fostered by
    The uses of patricians, and a life
    Spent in the storms of state and war; and also
    From the quick sense of honour, which becomes
    A duty to a certain sign, a vice
    When overstrained, and this I fear in him.                         110
    And then he has been rash from his youth upwards,
    Yet tempered by redeeming nobleness
    In such sort, that the wariest of republics
    Has lavished all its chief employs upon him,
    From his first fight to his last embassy,
    From which on his return the Dukedom met him.

    _Mar_. But previous to this marriage, had your heart
    Ne'er beat for any of the noble youth,
    Such as in years had been more meet to match
    Beauty like yours? or, since, have you ne'er seen                  120
    One, who, if your fair hand were still to give,
    Might now pretend to Loredano's daughter?

    _Ang_. I answered your first question when I said
    I married.

    _Mar_.      And the second?

    _Ang_.                     Needs no answer.

    _Mar_. I pray you pardon, if I have offended.

    _Ang_. I feel no wrath, but some surprise: I knew not
    That wedded bosoms could permit themselves
    To ponder upon what they _now_ might choose,
    Or aught save their past choice.

    _Mar_.                           'Tis their past choice
    That far too often makes them deem they would                      130
    Now choose more wisely, could they cancel it.

    _Ang_. It may be so. I knew not of such thoughts.

    _Mar_. Here comes the Doge--shall I retire?

    _Ang_.                                      It may
    Be better you should quit me; he seems rapt
    In thought.--How pensively he takes his way!
                                                         [_Exit_ MARIANNA.

                      _Enter the_ DOGE _and_ PIETRO.

    _Doge_ (_musing_). There is a certain Philip Calendaro
    Now in the Arsenal, who holds command
    Of eighty men, and has great influence
    Besides on all the spirits of his comrades:
    This man, I hear, is bold and popular,                             140
    Sudden and daring, and yet secret; 'twould
    Be well that he were won: I needs must hope
    That Israel Bertuccio has secured him,
    But fain would be----

    _Pie_.               My Lord, pray pardon me
    For breaking in upon your meditation;
    The Senator Bertuccio, your kinsman,
    Charged me to follow and enquire your pleasure
    To fix an hour when he may speak with you.

    _Doge_. At sunset.--Stay a moment--let me see--
    Say in the second hour of night.                       [_Exit_ PIETRO.

    _Ang_.                           My Lord!                          150

    _Doge_. My dearest child, forgive me--why delay
    So long approaching me?--I saw you not.

    _Ang_. You were absorbed in thought, and he who now
    Has parted from you might have words of weight
    To bear you from the Senate.

    _Doge_.                     From the Senate?

    _Ang_. I would not interrupt him in his duty
    And theirs.

    _Doge_.    The Senate's duty! you mistake;
    'Tis we who owe all service to the Senate.

    _Ang_. I thought the Duke had held command in Venice.

    _Doge_. He shall.--But let that pass.--We will be jocund.          160
    How fares it with you? have you been abroad?
    The day is overcast, but the calm wave
    Favours the gondolier's light skimming oar;
    Or have you held a levee of your friends?
    Or has your music made you solitary?
    Say--is there aught that you would will within
    The little sway now left the Duke? or aught
    Of fitting splendour, or of honest pleasure,
    Social or lonely, that would glad your heart,
    To compensate for many a dull hour, wasted                         170
    On an old man oft moved with many cares?
    Speak, and 'tis done.

    _Ang_.               You're ever kind to me.
    I have nothing to desire, or to request,
    Except to see you oftener and calmer.

    _Doge_. Calmer?

    _Ang_.         Aye, calmer, my good Lord.--Ah, why
    Do you still keep apart, and walk alone,
    And let such strong emotions stamp your brow,
    As not betraying their full import, yet
    Disclose too much?

    _Doge_.            Disclose too much!--of what?
    What is there to disclose?

    _Ang_.                    A heart so ill                           180
    At ease.

    _Doge_.    'Tis nothing, child.--But in the state
    You know what daily cares oppress all those
    Who govern this precarious commonwealth;
    Now suffering from the Genoese without,
    And malcontents within--'tis this which makes me
    More pensive and less tranquil than my wont.

    _Ang_. Yet this existed long before, and never
    Till in these late days did I see you thus.
    Forgive me; there is something at your heart
    More than the mere discharge of public duties,                     190
    Which long use and a talent like to yours
    Have rendered light, nay, a necessity,
    To keep your mind from stagnating. 'Tis not
    In hostile states, nor perils, thus to shake you,--
    You, who have stood all storms and never sunk,
    And climbed up to the pinnacle of power
    And never fainted by the way, and stand
    Upon it, and can look down steadily
    Along the depth beneath, and ne'er feel dizzy.
    Were Genoa's galleys riding in the port,                           200
    Were civil fury raging in Saint Mark's,
    You are not to be wrought on, but would fall,
    As you have risen, with an unaltered brow:
    Your feelings now are of a different kind;
    Something has stung your pride, not patriotism.

    _Doge_. Pride! Angiolina? Alas! none is left me.

    _Ang_. Yes--the same sin that overthrew the angels,
    And of all sins most easily besets
    Mortals the nearest to the angelic nature:
    The vile are only vain; the great are proud.                       210

    _Doge_. I _had_ the pride of honour, of _your_ honour,
    Deep at my heart--But let us change the theme.

    _Ang_. Ah no!--As I have ever shared your kindness
    In all things else, let me not be shut out
    From your distress: were it of public import,
    You know I never sought, would never seek
    To win a word from you; but feeling now
    Your grief is private, it belongs to me
    To lighten or divide it. Since the day
    When foolish Steno's ribaldry detected                             220
    Unfixed your quiet, you are greatly changed,
    And I would soothe you back to what you were.

    _Doge_. To what I was!--have you heard Steno's sentence?

    _Ang_. No.

    _Doge_.     A month's arrest.

    _Ang_.                        Is it not enough?

    _Doge_. Enough!--yes, for a drunken galley slave,
    Who, stung by stripes, may murmur at his master;
    But not for a deliberate, false, cool villain,
    Who stains a Lady's and a Prince's honour
    Even on the throne of his authority.

    _Ang_. There seems to be enough in the conviction                  230
    Of a patrician guilty of a falsehood:
    All other punishment were light unto
    His loss of honour.

    _Doge_.             Such men have no honour;
    They have but their vile lives--and these are spared.

    _Ang_. You would not have him die for this offence?

    _Doge_. Not _now_:--being still alive, I'd have him live
    Long as _he_ can; he has ceased to merit death;
    The guilty saved hath damned his hundred judges,
    And he is pure, for now his crime is theirs.

    _Ang_. Oh! had this false and flippant libeller                    240
    Shed his young blood for his absurd lampoon,
    Ne'er from that moment could this breast have known
    A joyous hour, or dreamless slumber more.

    _Doge_. Does not the law of Heaven say blood for blood?
    And he who _taints_ kills more than he who sheds it.
    Is it the _pain_ of blows, or _shame_ of blows,
    That makes such deadly to the sense of man?
    Do not the laws of man say blood for honour,--
    And, less than honour, for a little gold?
    Say not the laws of nations blood for treason?                     250
    Is't nothing to have filled these veins with poison
    For their once healthful current? is it nothing
    To have stained your name and mine--the noblest names?
    Is't nothing to have brought into contempt
    A Prince before his people? to have failed
    In the respect accorded by Mankind
    To youth in woman, and old age in man?
    To virtue in your sex, and dignity
    In ours?--But let them look to it who have saved him.

    _Ang_. Heaven bids us to forgive our enemies.                      260

    _Doge_. Doth Heaven forgive her own? Is there not Hell
    For wrath eternal?[df][405]

    _Ang_.                  Do not speak thus wildly--[dg]
    Heaven will alike forgive you and your foes.

    _Doge_. Amen! May Heaven forgive them!

    _Ang_.                                And will you?

    _Doge_. Yes, when they are in Heaven!

    _Ang_.                                And not till then?

    _Doge_. What matters my forgiveness? an old man's,
    Worn out, scorned, spurned, abused; what matters then
    My pardon more than my resentment, both
    Being weak and worthless? I have lived too long;
    But let us change the argument.--My child!                         270
    My injured wife, the child of Loredano,
    The brave, the chivalrous, how little deemed
    Thy father, wedding thee unto his friend,
    That he was linking thee to shame!--Alas!
    Shame without sin, for thou art faultless. Hadst thou
    But had a different husband, _any_ husband
    In Venice save the Doge, this blight, this brand,
    This blasphemy had never fallen upon thee.
    So young, so beautiful, so good, so pure,
    To suffer this, and yet be unavenged!                              280

    _Ang_. I am too well avenged, for you still love me,
    And trust, and honour me; and all men know
    That you are just, and I am true: what more
    Could I require, or you command?

    _Doge_.                          'Tis well,
    And may be better; but whate'er betide,
    Be thou at least kind to my memory.

    _Ang_. Why speak you thus?

    _Doge_.                    It is no matter why;
    But I would still, whatever others think,
    Have your respect both now and in my grave.

    _Ang_. Why should you doubt it? has it ever failed?                290

    _Doge_. Come hither, child! I would a word with you.
    Your father was my friend; unequal Fortune
    Made him my debtor for some courtesies
    Which bind the good more firmly: when, oppressed
    With his last malady, he willed our union,
    It was not to repay me, long repaid
    Before by his great loyalty in friendship;
    His object was to place your orphan beauty
    In honourable safety from the perils,
    Which, in this scorpion nest of vice, assail                       300
    A lonely and undowered maid. I did not
    Think with him, but would not oppose the thought
    Which soothed his death-bed.

    _Ang_.                       I have not forgotten
    The nobleness with which you bade me speak
    If my young heart held any preference
    Which would have made me happier; nor your offer
    To make my dowry equal to the rank
    Of aught in Venice, and forego all claim
    My father's last injunction gave you.

    _Doge_.                               Thus,
    'Twas not a foolish dotard's vile caprice,                         310
    Nor the false edge of aged appetite,
    Which made me covetous of girlish beauty,
    And a young bride: for in my fieriest youth
    I swayed such passions; nor was this my age
    Infected with that leprosy of lust[406]
    Which taints the hoariest years of vicious men,
    Making them ransack to the very last
    The dregs of pleasure for their vanished joys;
    Or buy in selfish marriage some young victim,
    Too helpless to refuse a state that's honest,                      320
    Too feeling not to know herself a wretch.
    Our wedlock was not of this sort; you had
    Freedom from me to choose, and urged in answer
    Your father's choice.

    _Ang_.               I did so; I would do so
    In face of earth and Heaven; for I have never
    Repented for my sake; sometimes for yours,
    In pondering o'er your late disquietudes.

    _Doge_. I knew my heart would never treat you harshly:
    I knew my days could not disturb you long;
    And then the daughter of my earliest friend,                       330
    His worthy daughter, free to choose again.
    Wealthier and wiser, in the ripest bloom
    Of womanhood, more skilful to select
    By passing these probationary years,
    Inheriting a Prince's name and riches,
    Secured, by the short penance of enduring
    An old man for some summers, against all
    That law's chicane or envious kinsmen might
    Have urged against her right; my best friend's child
    Would choose more fitly in respect of years,                       340
    And not less truly in a faithful heart.

    _Ang_. My Lord, I looked but to my father's wishes,
    Hallowed by his last words, and to my heart
    For doing all its duties, and replying
    With faith to him with whom I was affianced.
    Ambitious hopes ne'er crossed my dreams; and should
    The hour you speak of come, it will be seen so.

    _Doge_. I do believe you; and I know you true:
    For Love--romantic Love--which in my youth
    I knew to be illusion, and ne'er saw                               350
    Lasting, but often fatal, it had been
    No lure for me, in my most passionate days,
    And could not be so now, did such exist.
    But such respect, and mildly paid regard
    As a true feeling for your welfare, and
    A free compliance with all honest wishes,--
    A kindness to your virtues, watchfulness
    Not shown, but shadowing o'er such little failings
    As Youth is apt in, so as not to check
    Rashly, but win you from them ere you knew                         360
    You had been won, but thought the change your choice;
    A pride not in your beauty, but your conduct;
    A trust in you; a patriarchal love,
    And not a doting homage; friendship, faith,--
    Such estimation in your eyes as these
    Might claim, I hoped for.

    _Ang_.                   And have ever had.

    _Doge_. I think so. For the difference in our years
    You knew it choosing me, and chose; I trusted
    Not to my qualities, nor would have faith
    In such, nor outward ornaments of nature,                          370
    Were I still in my five and twentieth spring;
    I trusted to the blood of Loredano[407]
    Pure in your veins; I trusted to the soul
    God gave you--to the truths your father taught you--
    To your belief in Heaven--to your mild virtues--
    To your own faith and honour, for my own.

    _Ang_. You have done well.--I thank you for that trust,
    Which I have never for one moment ceased
    To honour you the more for.

    _Doge_.                      Where is Honour,
    Innate and precept-strengthened, 'tis the rock                     380
    Of faith connubial: where it is not--where
    Light thoughts are lurking, or the vanities
    Of worldly pleasure rankle in the heart,
    Or sensual throbs convulse it, well I know
    'Twere hopeless for humanity to dream
    Of honesty in such infected blood,
    Although 'twere wed to him it covets most:
    An incarnation of the poet's God
    In all his marble-chiselled beauty, or
    The demi-deity, Alcides, in                                        390
    His majesty of superhuman Manhood,
    Would not suffice to bind where virtue is not;
    It is consistency which forms and proves it:
    Vice cannot fix, and Virtue cannot change.
    The once fall'n woman must for ever fall;
    For Vice must have variety, while Virtue
    Stands like the Sun, and all which rolls around
    Drinks life, and light, and glory from her aspect.

    _Ang_. And seeing, feeling thus this truth in others,
    (I pray you pardon me;) but wherefore yield you                    400
    To the most fierce of fatal passions, and
    Disquiet your great thoughts with restless hate
    Of such a thing as Steno?

    _Doge_.                  You mistake me.
    It is not Steno who could move me thus;
    Had it been so, he should--but let that pass.

    _Ang_. What is't you feel so deeply, then, even now?

    _Doge_. The violated majesty of Venice,
    At once insulted in her Lord and laws.

    _Ang_. Alas! why will you thus consider it?

    _Doge_. I have thought on't till--but let me lead you back         410
    To what I urged; all these things being noted,
    I wedded you; the world then did me justice
    Upon the motive, and my conduct proved
    They did me right, while yours was all to praise:
    You had all freedom--all respect--all trust
    From me and mine; and, born of those who made
    Princes at home, and swept Kings from their thrones
    On foreign shores, in all things you appeared
    Worthy to be our first of native dames.

    _Ang_. To what does this conduct?

    _Doge_.                           To thus much--that               420
    A miscreant's angry breath may blast it all--
    A villain, whom for his unbridled bearing,
    Even in the midst of our great festival,
    I caused to be conducted forth, and taught
    How to demean himself in ducal chambers;
    A wretch like this may leave upon the wall
    The blighting venom of his sweltering heart,
    And this shall spread itself in general poison;
    And woman's innocence, man's honour, pass
    Into a by-word; and the doubly felon                               430
    (Who first insulted virgin modesty
    By a gross affront to your attendant damsels
    Amidst the noblest of our dames in public)
    Requite himself for his most just expulsion
    By blackening publicly his Sovereign's consort,
    And be absolved by his upright compeers.

    _Ang_. But he has been condemned into captivity.

    _Doge_. For such as him a dungeon were acquittal;
    And his brief term of mock-arrest will pass
    Within a palace. But I've done with him;                           440
    The rest must be with you.

    _Ang_.                     With me, my Lord?

    _Doge_. Yes, Angiolina. Do not marvel; I
    Have let this prey upon me till I feel
    My life cannot be long; and fain would have you
    Regard the injunctions you will find within
    This scroll (_giving her a paper_)
               ----Fear not; they are for your advantage:
    Read them hereafter at the fitting hour.

    _Ang_. My Lord, in life, and after life, you shall
    Be honoured still by me: but may your days
    Be many yet--and happier than the present!                         450
    This passion will give way, and you will be
    Serene, and what you should be--what you were.

    _Doge_. I will be what I should be, or be nothing;
    But never more--oh! never, never more,
    O'er the few days or hours which yet await
    The blighted old age of Faliero, shall
    Sweet Quiet shed her sunset! Never more
    Those summer shadows rising from the past
    Of a not ill-spent nor inglorious life,
    Mellowing the last hours as the night approaches,                  460
    Shall soothe me to my moment of long rest.
    I had but little more to ask, or hope,
    Save the regards due to the blood and sweat,
    And the soul's labour through which I had toiled
    To make my country honoured. As her servant--
    Her servant, though her chief--I would have gone
    Down to my fathers with a name serene
    And pure as theirs; but this has been denied me.
    Would I had died at Zara!

    _Ang_.                   There you saved
    The state; then live to save her still. A day,                     470
    Another day like that would be the best
    Reproof to them, and sole revenge for you.

    _Doge_. But one such day occurs within an age;
    My life is little less than one, and 'tis
    Enough for Fortune to have granted _once_,
    That which scarce one more favoured citizen
    May win in many states and years. But why
    Thus speak I? Venice has forgot that day--
    Then why should I remember it?--Farewell,
    Sweet Angiolina! I must to my cabinet;                             480
    There's much for me to do--and the hour hastens.[408]

    _Ang_. Remember what you were.

    _Doge_.                        It were in vain!
    Joy's recollection is no longer joy,
    While Sorrow's memory is a sorrow still.

    _Ang_. At least, whate'er may urge, let me implore
    That you will take some little pause of rest:
    Your sleep for many nights has been so turbid,
    That it had been relief to have awaked you,
    Had I not hoped that Nature would o'erpower
    At length the thoughts which shook your slumbers thus.             490
    An hour of rest will give you to your toils
    With fitter thoughts and freshened strength.

    _Doge_.                                      I cannot--
    I must not, if I could; for never was
    Such reason to be watchful: yet a few--
    Yet a few days and dream-perturbed nights,
    And I shall slumber well--but where?--no matter.
    Adieu, my Angiolina.

    _Ang_.                 Let me be
    An instant--yet an instant your companion!
    I cannot bear to leave you thus.

    _Doge_.                          Come then,
    My gentle child--forgive me: thou wert made                        500
    For better fortunes than to share in mine,
    Now darkling in their close toward the deep vale
    Where Death sits robed in his all-sweeping shadow.[dh]
    When I am gone--it may be sooner than
    Even these years warrant, for there is that stirring
    Within--above--around, that in this city
    Will make the cemeteries populous
    As e'er they were by pestilence or war,--
    When I _am_ nothing, let that which I _was_
    Be still sometimes a name on thy sweet lips,                       510
    A shadow in thy fancy, of a thing
    Which would not have thee mourn it, but remember.
    Let us begone, my child--the time is pressing.


              SCENE II.--_A retired spot near the Arsenal_.

              ISRAEL BERTUCCIO _and_ PHILIP CALENDARO.[409]

    _Cal_. How sped you, Israel, in your late complaint?

    _I. Ber_. Why, well.

    _Cal_.               Is't possible! will he be punished?

    _I. Ber_.                                                Yes.

    _Cal_. With what? a mulct or an arrest?

    _I. Ber_.                                With death!

    _Cal_. Now you rave, or must intend revenge,
    Such as I counselled you, with your own hand.

    _I. Ber_. Yes; and for one sole draught of hate, forego
    The great redress we meditate for Venice,
    And change a life of hope for one of exile;
    Leaving one scorpion crushed, and thousands stinging
    My friends, my family, my countrymen!                               10
    No, Calendaro; these same drops of blood,
    Shed shamefully, shall have the whole of his
    For their requital----But not only his;
    We will not strike for private wrongs alone:
    Such are for selfish passions and rash men,
    But are unworthy a Tyrannicide.

    _Cal_. You have more patience than I care to boast.
    Had I been present when you bore this insult,
    I must have slain him, or expired myself
    In the vain effort to repress my wrath.                             20

    _I. Ber_. Thank Heaven you were not--all had else been marred:
    As 'tis, our cause looks prosperous still.

    _Cal_.                                    You saw
    The Doge--what answer gave he?

    _I. Ber_.                     That there was
    No punishment for such as Barbaro.

    _Cal_. I told you so before, and that 'twas idle
    To think of justice from such hands.

    _I. Ber_.                           At least,
    It lulled suspicion, showing confidence.
    Had I been silent, not a Sbirro[410] but
    Had kept me in his eye, as meditating
    A silent, solitary, deep revenge.                                   30

    _Cal_. But wherefore not address you to the Council?
    The Doge is a mere puppet, who can scarce
    Obtain right for himself. Why speak to _him_?

    _I. Ber_. You shall know that hereafter.

    _Cal_.                                   Why not now?

    _I. Ber_. Be patient but till midnight. Get your musters,
    And bid our friends prepare their companies:
    Set all in readiness to strike the blow,
    Perhaps in a few hours: we have long waited
    For a fit time--that hour is on the dial,
    It may be, of to-morrow's sun: delay                                40
    Beyond may breed us double danger. See
    That all be punctual at our place of meeting,
    And armed, excepting those of the Sixteen,[411]
    Who will remain among the troops to wait
    The signal.

    _Cal_.      These brave words have breathed new life
    Into my veins; I am sick of these protracted
    And hesitating councils: day on day
    Crawled on, and added but another link
    To our long fetters, and some fresher wrong
    Inflicted on our brethren or ourselves,                             50
    Helping to swell our tyrants' bloated strength.
    Let us but deal upon them, and I care not
    For the result, which must be Death or Freedom!
    I'm weary to the heart of finding neither.

    _I. Ber_. We will be free in Life or Death! the grave
    Is chainless. Have you all the musters ready?
    And are the sixteen companies completed
    To sixty?

    _Cal_.    All save two, in which there are
    Twenty-five wanting to make up the number.

    _I. Ber_. No matter; we can do without. Whose are they?             60

    _Cal_. Bertram's[412] and old Soranzo's, both of whom
    Appear less forward in the cause than we are.

    _I. Ber_. Your fiery nature makes you deem all those
    Who are not restless cold; but there exists
    Oft in concentred spirits not less daring
    Than in more loud avengers. Do not doubt them.

    _Cat_. I do not doubt the elder; but in Bertram
    There is a hesitating softness, fatal
    To enterprise like ours: I've seen that man
    Weep like an infant o'er the misery                                 70
    Of others, heedless of his own, though greater;
    And in a recent quarrel I beheld him
    Turn sick at sight of blood, although a villain's.

    _I. Ber_. The truly brave are soft of heart and eyes,
    And feel for what their duty bids them do.
    I have known Bertram long; there doth not breathe
    A soul more full of honour.

    _Cal_.                       It may be so:
    I apprehend less treachery than weakness;
    Yet as he has no mistress, and no wife
    To work upon his milkiness of spirit,                               80
    He may go through the ordeal; it is well
    He is an orphan, friendless save in us:
    A woman or a child had made him less
    Than either in resolve.

    _I. Ber_.                Such ties are not
    For those who are called to the high destinies
    Which purify corrupted commonwealths;
    We must forget all feelings save the _one_,
    We must resign all passions save our purpose,
    We must behold no object save our country,
    And only look on Death as beautiful,                                90
    So that the sacrifice ascend to Heaven,
    And draw down Freedom on her evermore.

    _Cal_. But if we fail----[413]

    _I. Ber_.                They never fail who die
    In a great cause: the block may soak their gore:[di]
    Their heads may sodden in the sun; their limbs
    Be strung to city gates and castle walls--
    But still their Spirit walks abroad. Though years
    Elapse, and others share as dark a doom,
    They but augment the deep and sweeping thoughts
    Which overpower all others, and conduct                            100
    The world at last to Freedom. What were we,
    If Brutus had not lived? He died in giving[dj]
    Rome liberty, but left a deathless lesson--
    A name which is a virtue, and a Soul
    Which multiplies itself throughout all time,
    When wicked men wax mighty, and a state
    Turns servile. He and his high friend were styled
    "The last of Romans!"[414] Let us be the first
    Of true Venetians, sprung from Roman sires.

    _Cal_. Our fathers did not fly from Attila[415]                    110
    Into these isles, where palaces have sprung
    On banks redeemed from the rude ocean's ooze,
    To own a thousand despots in his place.
    Better bow down before the Hun, and call
    A Tartar lord, than these swoln silkworms[416] masters!
    The first at least was man, and used his sword
    As sceptre: these unmanly creeping things
    Command our swords, and rule us with a word
    As with a spell.

    _I. Ber_.        It shall be broken soon.
    You say that all things are in readiness;                          120
    To-day I have not been the usual round,
    And why thou knowest; but thy vigilance
    Will better have supplied my care: these orders
    In recent council to redouble now
    Our efforts to repair the galleys, have
    Lent a fair colour to the introduction
    Of many of our cause into the arsenal,
    As new artificers for their equipment,
    Or fresh recruits obtained in haste to man
    The hoped-for fleet.--Are all supplied with arms?                  130

    _Cal_. All who were deemed trust-worthy: there are some
    Whom it were well to keep in ignorance
    Till it be time to strike, and then supply them;
    When in the heat and hurry of the hour
    They have no opportunity to pause,
    But needs must on with those who will surround them.

    _I. Ber_. You have said well. Have you remarked all such?

    _Cal_. I've noted most; and caused the other chiefs
    To use like caution in their companies.
    As far as I have seen, we are enough                               140
    To make the enterprise secure, if 'tis
    Commenced to-morrow; but, till 'tis begun,
    Each hour is pregnant with a thousand perils.

    _I. Ber_. Let the Sixteen meet at the wonted hour,
    Except Soranzo, Nicoletto Blondo,
    And Marco Giuda, who will keep their watch
    Within the arsenal, and hold all ready,
    Expectant of the signal we will fix on.

    _Cal_. We will not fail.

    _I. Ber_.                 Let all the rest be there;
    I have a stranger to present to them.                              150

    _Cal_. A stranger! doth he know the secret?

    _I. Ber_.                                   Yes.

    _Cal_. And have you dared to peril your friends' lives
    On a rash confidence in one we know not?

    _I. Ber_. I have risked no man's life except my own--
    Of that be certain: he is one who may
    Make our assurance doubly sure, according[417]
    His aid; and if reluctant, he no less
    Is in our power: he comes alone with me,
    And cannot 'scape us; but he will not swerve.

    _Cal_. I cannot judge of this until I know him:                    160
    Is he one of our order?

    _I. Ber_.              Aye, in spirit,
    Although a child of Greatness; he is one
    Who would become a throne, or overthrow one--
    One who has done great deeds, and seen great changes;
    No tyrant, though bred up to tyranny;
    Valiant in war, and sage in council; noble
    In nature, although haughty; quick, yet wary:
    Yet for all this, so full of certain passions,
    That if once stirred and baffled, as he has been
    Upon the tenderest points, there is no Fury                        170
    In Grecian story like to that which wrings
    His vitals with her burning hands, till he
    Grows capable of all things for revenge;
    And add too, that his mind is liberal,
    He sees and feels the people are oppressed,
    And shares their sufferings. Take him all in all,
    We have need of such, and such have need of us.

    _Cal_. And what part would you have him take with us?

    _I. Ber_. It may be, that of Chief.

    _Cal_.                              What! and resign
    Your own command as leader?

    _I. Ber_.                  Even so.                                180
    My object is to make your cause end well,
    And not to push myself to power. Experience,
    Some skill, and your own choice, had marked me out
    To act in trust as your commander, till
    Some worthier should appear: if I have found such
    As you yourselves shall own more worthy, think you
    That I would hesitate from selfishness,
    And, covetous of brief authority,
    Stake our deep interest on my single thoughts,
    Rather than yield to one above me in                               190
    All leading qualities? No, Calendaro,
    Know your friend better; but you all shall judge.
    Away! and let us meet at the fixed hour.
    Be vigilant, and all will yet go well.

    _Cal_. Worthy Bertuccio, I have known you ever
    Trusty and brave, with head and heart to plan
    What I have still been prompt to execute.
    For my own part, I seek no other Chief;
    What the rest will decide, I know not, but
    I am with YOU, as I have ever been,                                200
    In all our undertakings. Now farewell,
    Until the hour of midnight sees us meet.                    [_Exeunt_.




                                 ACT III.


          SCENE I.--_Scene, the Space between the Canal and the
         Church of San Giovanni e San Paolo. An equestrian Statue
        before it.--A Gondola lies in the Canal at some distance._

                   _Enter the_ DOGE _alone, disguised_.

    _Doge_ (_solus_). I am before the hour, the hour whose voice,
    Pealing into the arch of night, might strike
    These palaces with ominous tottering,
    And rock their marbles to the corner-stone,
    Waking the sleepers from some hideous dream
    Of indistinct but awful augury
    Of that which will befall them. Yes, proud city!
    Thou must be cleansed of the black blood which makes thee
    A lazar-house of tyranny: the task
    Is forced upon me, I have sought it not;                            10
    And therefore was I punished, seeing this
    Patrician pestilence spread on and on,
    Until at length it smote me in my slumbers,
    And I am tainted, and must wash away
    The plague spots in the healing wave. Tall fane!
    Where sleep my fathers, whose dim statues shadow
    The floor which doth divide us from the dead,
    Where all the pregnant hearts of our bold blood,
    Mouldered into a mite of ashes, hold
    In one shrunk heap what once made many heroes,                      20
    When what is now a handful shook the earth--
    Fane of the tutelar saints who guard our house!
    Vault where two Doges rest[418]--my sires! who died
    The one of toil, the other in the field,
    With a long race of other lineal chiefs
    And sages, whose great labours, wounds, and state
    I have inherited,--let the graves gape,
    Till all thine aisles be peopled with the dead,
    And pour them from thy portals to gaze on me!
    I call them up, and them and thee to witness                        30
    What it hath been which put me to this task--
    Their pure high blood, their blazon-roll of glories,
    Their mighty name dishonoured all _in_ me,
    Not _by_ me, but by the ungrateful nobles
    We fought to make our equals, not our lords:[dk]
    And chiefly thou, Ordelafo the brave,
    Who perished in the field, where I since conquered,
    Battling at Zara, did the hecatombs
    Of thine and Venice' foes, there offered up
    By thy descendant, merit such acquittance?[dl]                      40
    Spirits! smile down upon me! for my cause
    Is yours, in all life now can be of yours,--
    Your fame, your name, all mingled up in mine,
    And in the future fortunes of our race!
    Let me but prosper, and I make this city
    Free and immortal, and our House's name
    Worthier of what you were--now and hereafter!

                        _Enter_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO.

    _I. Ber_. Who goes there?

    _Doge_.                  A friend to Venice.

    _I. Ber_.                                    'Tis he.
    Welcome, my Lord,--you are before the time.

    _Doge_. I am ready to proceed to your assembly.                     50

    _I. Ber_. Have with you.--I am proud and pleased to see
    Such confident alacrity. Your doubts
    Since our last meeting, then, are all dispelled?

    _Doge_. Not so--but I have set my little left[419]
    Of life upon this cast: the die was thrown
    When I first listened to your treason.--Start not!
    _That_ is the word; I cannot shape my tongue
    To syllable black deeds into smooth names,
    Though I be wrought on to commit them. When
    I heard you tempt your Sovereign, and forbore                       60
    To have you dragged to prison, I became
    Your guiltiest accomplice: now you may,
    If it so please you, do as much by me.

    _I. Ber_. Strange words, my Lord, and most unmerited;
    I am no spy, and neither are we traitors.

    _Doge_. _We--We!_--no matter--you have earned the right
    To talk of _us_.--But to the point.--If this
    Attempt succeeds, and Venice, rendered free
    And flourishing, when we are in our graves,
    Conducts her generations to our tombs,                              70
    And makes her children with their little hands
    Strew flowers o'er her deliverers' ashes, then
    The consequence will sanctify the deed,
    And we shall be like the two Bruti in
    The annals of hereafter; but if not,
    If we should fail, employing bloody means
    And secret plot, although to a good end,
    Still we are traitors, honest Israel;--thou
    No less than he who was thy Sovereign
    Six hours ago, and now thy brother rebel.                           80

    _I. Ber_. 'Tis not the moment to consider thus,
    Else I could answer.--Let us to the meeting,
    Or we may be observed in lingering here.

    _Doge_. We _are_ observed, and have been.

    _I. Ber_.                                 We observed!
    Let me discover--and this steel-----

    _Doge_.                         Put up;
    Here are no human witnesses: look there--
    What see you?

    _I. Ber_.    Only a tall warrior's statue[420]
    Bestriding a proud steed, in the dim light
    Of the dull moon.

    _Doge_.           That Warrior was the sire
    Of my sire's fathers, and that statue was                           90
    Decreed to him by the twice rescued city:--
    Think you that he looks down on us or no?

    _I. Ber_. My Lord, these are mere fantasies; there are
    No eyes in marble.

    _Doge_.       But there are in Death.
    I tell thee, man, there is a spirit in
    Such things that acts and sees, unseen, though felt;
    And, if there be a spell to stir the dead,
    'Tis in such deeds as we are now upon.
    Deem'st thou the souls of such a race as mine
    Can rest, when he, their last descendant Chief,                    100
    Stands plotting on the brink of their pure graves
    With stung plebeians?

    _I. Ber_.            It had been as well
    To have pondered this before,--ere you embarked
    In our great enterprise.--Do you repent?

    _Doge_. No--but I _feel_, and shall do to the last.
    I cannot quench a glorious life at once,
    Nor dwindle to the thing I now must be,[dm]
    And take men's lives by stealth, without some pause:
    Yet doubt me not; it is this very feeling,
    And knowing _what_ has wrung me to be thus,                        110
    Which is your best security. There's not
    A roused mechanic in your busy plot[dn]
    So wronged as I, so fall'n, so loudly called
    To his redress: the very means I am forced
    By these fell tyrants to adopt is such,
    That I abhor them doubly for the deeds
    Which I must do to pay them back for theirs.

    _I. Ber_. Let us away--hark--the Hour strikes.

    _Doge_.                                        On--on--
    It is our knell, or that of Venice.--On.

    _I. Ber_. Say rather, 'tis her Freedom's rising peal               120
    Of Triumph. This way--we are near the place.
                                                                [_Exeunt_.


           SCENE II.--_The House where the Conspirators meet._

          DAGOLINO, DORO, BERTRAM, FEDELE TREVISANO, CALENDARO,
                     ANTONIO DELLE BENDE, ETC., ETC.

    _Cal_. (_entering_). Are all here?

    _Dag_.                           All with you; except the three
    On duty, and our leader Israel,
    Who is expected momently.

    _Cal_.               Where's Bertram?

    _Ber_. Here!

    _Cal_.       Have you not been able to complete
    The number wanting in your company?

    _Ber_. I had marked out some: but I have not dared
    To trust them with the secret, till assured
    That they were worthy faith.

    _Cal_.                       There is no need
    Of trusting to their faith; _who_, save ourselves
    And our more chosen comrades, is aware                              10
    Fully of our intent? they think themselves
    Engaged in secret to the Signory,[421]
    To punish some more dissolute young nobles
    Who have defied the law in their excesses;
    But once drawn up, and their new swords well fleshed
    In the rank hearts of the more odious Senators,
    They will not hesitate to follow up
    Their blow upon the others, when they see
    The example of their chiefs, and I for one
    Will set them such, that they for very shame                        20
    And safety will not pause till all have perished.

    _Ber_. How say you? _all!_

    _Cal_.                     Whom wouldst thou spare?

    _Ber_.                                         _I spare?_
    I have no power to spare. I only questioned,
    Thinking that even amongst these wicked men
    There might be some, whose age and qualities
    Might mark them out for pity.

    _Cal_.                       Yes, such pity
    As when the viper hath been cut to pieces,
    The separate fragments quivering in the sun,
    In the last energy of venomous life,
    Deserve and have. Why, I should think as soon                       30
    Of pitying some particular fang which made
    One in the jaw of the swoln serpent, as
    Of saving one of these: they form but links
    Of one long chain; one mass, one breath, one body;
    They eat, and drink, and live, and breed together,
    Revel, and lie, oppress, and kill in concert,--
    So let them die as _one!_[do]

    _Dag_.                  Should _one_ survive,
    He would be dangerous as the whole; it is not
    Their number, be it tens or thousands, but
    The spirit of this Aristocracy                                      40
    Which must be rooted out; and if there were
    A single shoot of the old tree in life,
    'Twould fasten in the soil, and spring again
    To gloomy verdure and to bitter fruit.
    Bertram, we must be firm!

    _Cal_.                   Look to it well
    Bertram! I have an eye upon thee.

    _Ber_.                            Who
    Distrusts me?

    _Cal_.       Not I; for if I did so,
    Thou wouldst not now be there to talk of trust:
    It is thy softness, not thy want of faith,
    Which makes thee to be doubted.


    _Ber_.                         You should know                      50
    Who hear me, who and what I am; a man
    Roused like yourselves to overthrow oppression;
    A kind man, I am apt to think, as some
    Of you have found me; and if brave or no,
    You, Calendaro, can pronounce, who have seen me
    Put to the proof; or, if you should have doubts,
    I'll clear them on your person!

    _Cal_.                         You are welcome,
    When once our enterprise is o'er, which must not
    Be interrupted by a private brawl.

    _Ber_. I am no brawler; but can bear myself                         60
    As far among the foe as any he
    Who hears me; else why have I been selected
    To be of your chief comrades? but no less
    I own my natural weakness; I have not
    Yet learned to think of indiscriminate murder
    Without some sense of shuddering; and the sight
    Of blood which spouts through hoary scalps is not
    To me a thing of triumph, nor the death
    Of man surprised a glory. Well--too well
    I know that we must do such things on those                         70
    Whose acts have raised up such avengers; but
    If there were some of these who could be saved
    From out this sweeping fate, for our own sakes
    And for our honour, to take off some stain
    Of massacre, which else pollutes it wholly,
    I had been glad; and see no cause in this
    For sneer, nor for suspicion!

    _Dag_.                       Calm thee, Bertram,
    For we suspect thee not, and take good heart.
    It is the cause, and not our will, which asks
    Such actions from our hands: we'll wash away                        80
    All stains in Freedom's fountain!

          _Enter_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO, _and the_ DOGE, _disguised_.

    _Dag_.                            Welcome, Israel.

    _Consp_. Most welcome.--Brave Bertuccio, thou art late--
    Who is this stranger?

    _Cal_.               It is time to name him.
    Our comrades are even now prepared to greet him
    In brotherhood, as I have made it known
    That thou wouldst add a brother to our cause,
    Approved by thee, and thus approved by all,
    Such is our trust in all thine actions. Now
    Let him unfold himself.

    _I. Ber_.              Stranger, step forth!
                                            [_The Doge discovers himself_.

    _Consp_. To arms!--we are betrayed--it is the Doge!                 90
    Down with them both! our traitorous captain, and
    The tyrant he hath sold us to.

    _Cal_. (_drawing his sword_).  Hold! hold!
    Who moves a step against them dies. Hold! hear
    Bertuccio--What! are you appalled to see
    A lone, unguarded, weaponless old man
    Amongst you?--Israel, speak! what means this mystery?

    _I. Ber_. Let them advance and strike at their own bosoms,
    Ungrateful suicides! for on our lives
    Depend their own, their fortunes, and their hopes.

    _Doge_. Strike!--If I dreaded death, a death more fearful          100
    Than any your rash weapons can inflict,
    I should not now be here: Oh, noble Courage!
    The eldest born of Fear, which makes you brave
    Against this solitary hoary head!
    See the bold chiefs, who would reform a state
    And shake down senates, mad with wrath and dread
    At sight of one patrician! Butcher me!
    You can, I care not.--Israel, are these men
    The mighty hearts you spoke of? look upon them!

    _Cal_. Faith! he hath shamed us, and deservedly,                   110
    Was this your trust in your true Chief Bertuccio,
    To turn your swords against him and his guest?
    Sheathe them, and hear him.

    _I. Ber_.                   I disdain to speak.
    They might and must have known a heart like mine
    Incapable of treachery; and the power
    They gave me to adopt all fitting means
    To further their design was ne'er abused.
    They might be certain that who e'er was brought
    By me into this Council had been led
    To take his choice--as brother, or as victim.                      120

    _Doge_. And which am I to be? your actions leave
    Some cause to doubt the freedom of the choice.

    _I. Ber_. My Lord, we would have perished here together,
    Had these rash men proceeded; but, behold,
    They are ashamed of that mad moment's impulse,
    And droop their heads; believe me, they are such
    As I described them.--Speak to them.

    _Cal_.                              Aye, speak;
    We are all listening in wonder.[dp]

    _I. Ber_. (_addressing the conspirators_). You are safe,
    Nay, more, almost triumphant--listen then,
    And know my words for truth.

    _Doge_.                     You see me here,                       130
    As one of you hath said, an old, unarmed,
    Defenceless man; and yesterday you saw me
    Presiding in the hall of ducal state,
    Apparent Sovereign of our hundred isles,[dq][422]
    Robed in official purple, dealing out
    The edicts of a power which is not mine,
    Nor yours, but of our masters--the patricians.
    Why I was there you know, or think you know;
    Why I am _here_, he who hath been most wronged,
    He who among you hath been most insulted,                          140
    Outraged and trodden on, until he doubt
    If he be worm or no, may answer for me,
    Asking of his own heart what brought him here?
    You know my recent story, all men know it,
    And judge of it far differently from those
    Who sate in judgement to heap scorn on scorn.
    But spare me the recital--it is here,
    Here at my heart the outrage--but my words,
    Already spent in unavailing plaints,
    Would only show my feebleness the more,                            150
    And I come here to strengthen even the strong,
    And urge them on to deeds, and not to war
    With woman's weapons; but I need not urge you.
    Our private wrongs have sprung from public vices,
    In this--I cannot call it commonwealth,
    Nor kingdom, which hath neither prince nor people,
    But all the sins of the old Spartan state[dr]
    Without its virtues--temperance and valour.
    The Lords of Lacedaemon were true soldiers,[ds]
    But ours are Sybarites, while we are Helots,                       160
    Of whom I am the lowest, most enslaved;
    Although dressed out to head a pageant, as
    The Greeks of yore made drunk their slaves to form
    A pastime for their children. You are met
    To overthrow this Monster of a state,
    This mockery of a Government, this spectre,
    Which must be exorcised with blood,--and then
    We will renew the times of Truth and Justice,
    Condensing in a fair free commonwealth
    Not rash equality but equal rights,                                170
    Proportioned like the columns to the temple,
    Giving and taking strength reciprocal,
    And making firm the whole with grace and beauty,
    So that no part could be removed without
    Infringement of the general symmetry.
    In operating this great change, I claim
    To be one of you--if you trust in me;
    If not, strike home,--my life is compromised,
    And I would rather fall by freemen's hands
    Than live another day to act the tyrant                            180
    As delegate of tyrants: such I am not,
    And never have been--read it in our annals;
    I can appeal to my past government
    In many lands and cities; they can tell you
    If I were an oppressor, or a man
    Feeling and thinking for my fellow men.
    Haply had I been what the Senate sought,
    A thing of robes and trinkets,[423] dizened out
    To sit in state as for a Sovereign's picture;
    A popular scourge, a ready sentence-signer,                        190
    A stickler for the Senate and "the Forty,"
    A sceptic of all measures which had not
    The sanction of "the Ten,"[424] a council-fawner,
    A tool--a fool--a puppet,--they had ne'er
    Fostered the wretch who stung me. What I suffer
    Has reached me through my pity for the people;
    That many know, and they who know not yet
    Will one day learn: meantime I do devote,
    Whate'er the issue, my last days of life--
    My present power such as it is, not that                           200
    Of Doge, but of a man who has been great
    Before he was degraded to a Doge,
    And still has individual means and mind;
    I stake my fame (and I had fame)--my breath--
    (The least of all, for its last hours are nigh)
    My heart--my hope--my soul--upon this cast!
    Such as I am, I offer me to you
    And to your chiefs; accept me or reject me,--
    A Prince who fain would be a Citizen
    Or nothing, and who has left his throne to be so.                  210

    _Cal_. Long live Faliero!--Venice shall be free!

    _Consp_. Long live Faliero!

    _I. Ber_.                    Comrades! did I well?
    Is not this man a host in such a cause?

    _Doge_. This is no time for eulogies, nor place
    For exultation. Am I one of you?

    _Cal_. Aye, and the first among us, as thou hast been
    Of Venice--be our General and Chief.

    _Doge_. Chief!--General!--I was General at Zara,
    And Chief in Rhodes and Cyprus,[425] Prince in Venice:
    I cannot stoop--that is, I am not fit                              220
    To lead a band of--patriots: when I lay
    Aside the dignities which I have borne,
    'Tis not to put on others, but to be
    Mate to my fellows--but now to the point:
    Israel has stated to me your whole plan--
    'Tis bold, but feasible if I assist it,
    And must be set in motion instantly.

    _Cal_. E'en when thou wilt. Is it not so, my friends?
    I have disposed all for a sudden blow;
    When shall it be then?

    _Doge_.               At sunrise.

    _Ber_.                            So soon?                         230

    _Doge_. So soon?--so late--each hour accumulates
    Peril on peril, and the more so now
    Since I have mingled with you;--know you not
    The Council, and "the Ten?" the spies, the eyes
    Of the patricians dubious of their slaves,
    And now more dubious of the Prince they have made one?
    I tell you, you must strike, and suddenly,
    Full to the Hydra's heart--its heads will follow.

    _Cal_. With all my soul and sword, I yield assent;
    Our companies are ready, sixty each,                               240
    And all now under arms by Israel's order;
    Each at their different place of rendezvous,
    And vigilant, expectant of some blow;
    Let each repair for action to his post!
    And now, my Lord, the signal?

    _Doge_.                       When you hear
    The great bell of Saint Mark's, which may not be
    Struck without special order of the Doge
    (The last poor privilege they leave their Prince),
    March on Saint Mark's!

    _I. Ber_.              And there?--

    _Doge_.                           By different routes
    Let your march be directed, every sixty                            250
    Entering a separate avenue, and still
    Upon the way let your cry be of War
    And of the Genoese Fleet, by the first dawn
    Discerned before the port; form round the palace,
    Within whose court will be drawn out in arms
    My nephew and the clients of our house,
    Many and martial; while the bell tolls on,
    Shout ye, "Saint Mark!--the foe is on our waters!"

    _Cal_. I see it now--but on, my noble Lord.

    _Doge_. All the patricians flocking to the Council,                260
    (Which they dare not refuse, at the dread signal
    Pealing from out their Patron Saint's proud tower,)
    Will then be gathered in unto the harvest,
    And we will reap them with the sword for sickle.
    If some few should be tardy or absent, them,
    'Twill be but to be taken faint and single,
    When the majority are put to rest.

    _Cal_. Would that the hour were come! we will not scotch,[426]
    But kill.

    _Ber_.     Once more, sir, with your pardon, I
    Would now repeat the question which I asked                        270
    Before Bertuccio added to our cause
    This great ally who renders it more sure,
    And therefore safer, and as such admits
    Some dawn of mercy to a portion of
    Our victims--must all perish in this slaughter?

    _Cal_. All who encounter me and mine--be sure,
    The mercy they have shown, I show.

    _Consp_.                            All! all!
    Is this a time to talk of pity? when
    Have they e'er shown, or felt, or feigned it?

    _I. Ber_.                                    Bertram,
    This false compassion is a folly, and                              280
    Injustice to thy comrades and thy cause!
    Dost thou not see, that if we single out
    Some for escape, they live but to avenge
    The fallen? and how distinguish now the innocent
    From out the guilty? all their acts are one--
    A single emanation from one body,
    Together knit for our oppression! 'Tis
    Much that we let their children live; I doubt
    If all of these even should be set apart:
    The hunter may reserve some single cub                             290
    From out the tiger's litter, but who e'er
    Would seek to save the spotted sire or dam,
    Unless to perish by their fangs? however,
    I will abide by Doge Faliero's counsel:
    Let him decide if any should be saved.

    _Doge_. Ask me not--tempt me not with such a question--
    Decide yourselves.

    _I. Ber_.           You know their private virtues
    Far better than we can, to whom alone
    Their public vices, and most foul oppression,
    Have made them deadly; if there be amongst them                    300
    One who deserves to be repealed, pronounce.

    _Doge_. Dolfino's father was my friend, and Lando
    Fought by my side, and Marc Cornaro shared[dt][427]
    My Genoese embassy: I saved the life[du]
    Of Veniero--shall I save it twice?
    Would that I could save them and Venice also!
    All these men, or their fathers, were my friends
    Till they became my subjects; then fell from me
    As faithless leaves drop from the o'erblown flower,
    And left me a lone blighted thorny stalk,                          310
    Which, in its solitude, can shelter nothing;
    So, as they let me wither, let them perish!

    _Cal_. They cannot co-exist with Venice' freedom!

    _Doge_. Ye, though you know and feel our mutual mass
    Of many wrongs, even ye are ignorant[dv]
    What fatal poison to the springs of Life,
    To human ties, and all that's good and dear,
    Lurks in the present institutes of Venice:
    All these men were my friends; I loved them, they
    Requited honourably my regards;                                    320
    We served and fought; we smiled and wept in concert;
    We revelled or we sorrowed side by side;
    We made alliances of blood and marriage;
    We grew in years and honours fairly,--till
    Their own desire, not my ambition, made
    Them choose me for their Prince, and then farewell!
    Farewell all social memory! all thoughts
    In common! and sweet bonds which link old friendships,
    When the survivors of long years and actions,
    Which now belong to history, soothe the days                       330
    Which yet remain by treasuring each other,
    And never meet, but each beholds the mirror
    Of half a century on his brother's brow,
    And sees a hundred beings, now in earth,
    Flit round them whispering of the days gone by,
    And seeming not all dead, as long as two
    Of the brave, joyous, reckless, glorious band,
    Which once were one and many, still retain
    A breath to sigh for them, a tongue to speak
    Of deeds that else were silent, save on marble----                 340
    _Oime Oime!_[428]--and must I do this deed?

    _I. Ber_. My Lord, you are much moved: it is not now
    That such things must be dwelt upon.

    _Doge_.                              Your patience
    A moment--I recede not: mark with me
    The gloomy vices of this government.
    From the hour they made me Doge, the _Doge_ they _made_ me--
    Farewell the past! I died to all that had been,
    Or rather they to me: no friends, no kindness,
    No privacy of life--all were cut off:
    They came not near me--such approach gave umbrage;                 350
    They could not love me--such was not the law;
    They thwarted me--'twas the state's policy;
    They baffled me--'twas a patrician's duty;
    They wronged me, for such was to right the state;
    They could not right me--that would give suspicion;
    So that I was a slave to my own subjects;
    So that I was a foe to my own friends;
    Begirt with spies for guards, with robes for power,
    With pomp for freedom, gaolers for a council,
    Inquisitors for friends, and Hell for life!                        360
    I had only one fount of quiet left,
    And _that_ they poisoned! My pure household gods[429]
    Were shivered on my hearth, and o'er their shrine
    Sate grinning Ribaldry, and sneering Scorn.[dw]

    _I. Ber_. You have been deeply wronged, and now shall be
    Nobly avenged before another night.

    _Doge_. I had borne all--it hurt me, but I bore it--
    Till this last running over of the cup
    Of bitterness--until this last loud insult,
    Not only unredressed, but sanctioned; then,                        370
    And thus, I cast all further feelings from me--
    The feelings which they crushed for me, long, long[dx]
    Before, even in their oath of false allegiance!
    Even in that very hour and vow, they abjured
    Their friend and made a Sovereign, as boys make
    _Playthings_, to do their pleasure--and be broken![dy]
    I from that hour have seen but Senators
    In dark suspicious conflict with the Doge,
    Brooding with him in mutual hate and fear;
    They dreading he should snatch the tyranny                         380
    From out their grasp, and he abhorring tyrants.
    To me, then, these men have no _private_ life,
    Nor claim to ties they have cut off from others;
    As Senators for arbitrary acts
    Amenable, I look on them--as such
    Let them be dealt upon.

    _Cal_.                  And now to action!
    Hence, brethren, to our posts, and may this be
    The last night of mere words: I'd fain be doing!
    Saint Mark's great bell at dawn shall find me wakeful!

    _I. Ber_. Disperse then to your posts: be firm and vigilant;       390
    Think on the wrongs we bear, the rights we claim.
    This day and night shall be the last of peril!
    Watch for the signal, and then march. I go
    To join my band; let each be prompt to marshal
    His separate charge: the Doge will now return
    To the palace to prepare all for the blow.
    We part to meet in Freedom and in Glory!

    _Cal_. Doge, when I greet you next, my homage to you
    Shall be the head of Steno on this sword!

    _Doge_. No; let him be reserved unto the last,                     400
    Nor turn aside to strike at such a prey,[dz]
    Till nobler game is quarried: his offence
    Was a mere ebullition of the vice,
    The general corruption generated
    By the foul Aristocracy: he could not--
    He dared not in more honourable days
    Have risked it. I have merged all private wrath
    Against him in the thought of our great purpose.
    A slave insults me--I require his punishment
    From his proud master's hands; if he refuse it,                    410
    The offence grows his, and let him answer it.

    _Cal_. Yet, as the immediate cause of the alliance
    Which consecrates our undertaking more,
    I owe him such deep gratitude, that fain
    I would repay him as he merits; may I?

    _Doge_. You would but lop the hand, and I the head;
    You would but smite the scholar, I the master;
    You would but punish Steno, I the Senate.
    I cannot pause on individual hate,
    In the absorbing, sweeping, whole revenge,                         420
    Which, like the sheeted fire from Heaven, must blast
    Without distinction, as it fell of yore,
    Where the Dead Sea hath quenched two Cities' ashes.

    _I. Ber_. Away, then, to your posts! I but remain
    A moment to accompany the Doge
    To our late place of tryst, to see no spies
    Have been upon the scout, and thence I hasten
    To where my allotted band is under arms.

    _Cal_. Farewell, then,--until dawn!

    _I. Ber_.                           Success go with you!

    _Consp_. We will not fail--Away! My Lord, farewell!                430

               [_The Conspirators salute the_ DOGE _and_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO,
                _and retire, headed by_ PHILIP CALENDARO. _The_ DOGE _and_
                                                ISRAEL BERTUCCIO _remain_.

    _I. Ber_. We have them in the toil--it cannot fail!
    Now thou'rt indeed a Sovereign, and wilt make
    A name immortal greater than the greatest:
    Free citizens have struck at Kings ere now;
    Caesars have fallen, and even patrician hands
    Have crushed dictators, as the popular steel
    Has reached patricians: but, until this hour,
    What Prince has plotted for his people's freedom?
    Or risked a life to liberate his subjects?
    For ever, and for ever, they conspire                              440
    Against the people, to abuse their hands
    To chains, but laid aside to carry weapons
    Against the fellow nations, so that yoke
    On yoke, and slavery and death may whet,
    _Not glut_, the never-gorged Leviathan!
    Now, my Lord, to our enterprise;--'tis great,
    And greater the reward; why stand you rapt?
    A moment back, and you were all impatience!

    _Doge_. And is it then decided! must they die?

    _I. Ber_. Who?

    _Doge_.        My own friends by blood and courtesy,               450
    And many deeds and days--the Senators?

    _I. Ber_. You passed their sentence, and it is a just one.

    _Doge_. Aye, so it seems, and so it is to _you_;
    You are a patriot, a plebeian Gracchus--[ea]
    The rebel's oracle, the people's tribune--
    I blame you not--you act in your vocation;[430]
    They smote you, and oppressed you, and despised you;
    So they have _me_: but _you_ ne'er spake with them;
    You never broke their bread, nor shared their salt;
    You never had their wine-cup at your lips:                         460
    You grew not up with them, nor laughed, nor wept,
    Nor held a revel in their company;
    Ne'er smiled to see them smile, nor claimed their smile
    In social interchange for yours, nor trusted
    Nor wore them in your heart of hearts, as I have:
    These hairs of mine are grey, and so are theirs,
    The elders of the Council: I remember
    When all our locks were like the raven's wing,
    As we went forth to take our prey around
    The isles wrung from the false Mahometan;                          470
    And can I see them dabbled o'er with blood?
    Each stab to them will seem my suicide.

    _I. Ber_. Doge! Doge! this vacillation is unworthy
    A child; if you are not in second childhood,
    Call back your nerves to your own purpose, nor
    Thus shame yourself and me. By Heavens! I'd rather
    Forego even now, or fail in our intent,
    Than see the man I venerate subside
    From high resolves into such shallow weakness!
    You have seen blood in battle, shed it, both                       480
    Your own and that of others; can you shrink then
    From a few drops from veins of hoary vampires,
    Who but give back what they have drained from millions?

    _Doge_. Bear with me! Step by step, and blow on blow,
    I will divide with you; think not I waver:
    Ah! no; it is the _certainty_ of all
    Which I must do doth make me tremble thus.
    But let these last and lingering thoughts have way,
    To which you only and the night are conscious,
    And both regardless; when the Hour arrives,                        490
    'Tis mine to sound the knell, and strike the blow,
    Which shall unpeople many palaces,
    And hew the highest genealogic trees
    Down to the earth, strewed with their bleeding fruit,
    And crush their blossoms into barrenness:
    _This will_ I--must I--have I sworn to do,
    Nor aught can turn me from my destiny;
    But still I quiver to behold what I
    Must be, and think what I have been! Bear with me.

    _I. Ber_. Re-man your breast; I feel no such remorse,              500
    I understand it not: why should you change?
    You acted, and you act, on your free will.

    _Doge_. Aye, there it is--_you_ feel not, nor do I,
    Else I should stab thee on the spot, to save
    A thousand lives--and killing, do no murder;
    You _feel_ not--you go to this butcher-work
    As if these high-born men were steers for shambles:
    When all is over, you'll be free and merry,
    And calmly wash those hands incarnadine;
    But I, outgoing thee and all thy fellows                           510
    In this surpassing massacre, shall be,
    Shall see and feel--oh God! oh God! 'tis true,
    And thou dost well to answer that it was
    "My own free will and act," and yet you err,
    For I will do this! Doubt not--fear not; I
    Will be your most unmerciful accomplice!
    And yet I act no more on my free will,
    Nor my own feelings--both compel me back;
    But there is _Hell_ within me and around,
    And like the Demon who believes and trembles                       520
    Must I abhor and do. Away! away!
    Get thee unto thy fellows, I will hie me
    To gather the retainers of our house.
    Doubt not, St. Mark's great bell shall wake all Venice,
    Except her slaughtered Senate: ere the Sun
    Be broad upon the Adriatic there
    Shall be a voice of weeping, which shall drown
    The roar of waters in the cry of blood!
    I am resolved--come on.

    _I. Ber_.                 With all my soul!
    Keep a firm rein upon these bursts of passion;                     530
    Remember what these men have dealt to thee,
    And that this sacrifice will be succeeded
    By ages of prosperity and freedom
    To this unshackled city: a true tyrant[eb]
    Would have depopulated empires, nor
    Have felt the strange compunction which hath wrung you
    To punish a few traitors to the people.
    Trust me, such were a pity more misplaced
    Than the late mercy of the state to Steno.

    _Doge_. Man, thou hast struck upon the chord which jars            540
    All nature from my heart. Hence to our task!
                                                                [_Exeunt_.




                                 ACT IV.


      SCENE I.--_Palazzo of the Patrician_ LIONI.[431] LIONI _laying
        aside the mask and cloak which the Venetian Nobles wore in
                     public, attended by a Domestic_.

    _Lioni_. I will to rest, right weary of this revel,
    The gayest we have held for many moons,
    And yet--I know not why--it cheered me not;
    There came a heaviness across my heart,
    Which, in the lightest movement of the dance,
    Though eye to eye, and hand in hand united
    Even with the Lady of my Love, oppressed me,
    And through my spirit chilled my blood, until
    A damp like Death rose o'er my brow; I strove
    To laugh the thought away, but 'twould not be;                      10
    Through all the music ringing in my ears[ec]
    A knell was sounding as distinct and clear,
    Though low and far, as e'er the Adrian wave
    Rose o'er the City's murmur in the night,
    Dashing against the outward Lido's bulwark:
    So that I left the festival before
    It reached its zenith, and will woo my pillow
    For thoughts more tranquil, or forgetfulness.
    Antonio, take my mask and cloak, and light
    The lamp within my chamber.

    _Ant_.                       Yes, my Lord:                          20
    Command you no refreshment?

    _Lioni_.                      Nought, save sleep,
    Which will not be commanded. Let me hope it,
                                                          [_Exit_ ANTONIO.
    Though my breast feels too anxious; I will try
    Whether the air will calm my spirits: 'tis
    A goodly night; the cloudy wind which blew
    From the Levant hath crept into its cave,
    And the broad Moon hath brightened. What a stillness!
                                               [_Goes to an open lattice_.
    And what a contrast with the scene I left,
    Where the tall torches' glare, and silver lamps'
    More pallid gleam along the tapestried walls,                       30
    Spread over the reluctant gloom which haunts
    Those vast and dimly-latticed galleries
    A dazzling mass of artificial light,
    Which showed all things, but nothing as they were.
    There Age essaying to recall the past,
    After long striving for the hues of Youth
    At the sad labour of the toilet, and
    Full many a glance at the too faithful mirror,
    Pranked forth in all the pride of ornament,
    Forgot itself, and trusting to the falsehood                        40
    Of the indulgent beams, which show, yet hide,
    Believed itself forgotten, and was fooled.
    There Youth, which needed not, nor thought of such
    Vain adjuncts, lavished its true bloom, and health,
    And bridal beauty, in the unwholesome press
    Of flushed and crowded wassailers, and wasted
    Its hours of rest in dreaming this was pleasure,
    And so shall waste them till the sunrise streams
    On sallow cheeks and sunken eyes, which should not
    Have worn this aspect yet for many a year.[432]                     50
    The music, and the banquet, and the wine,
    The garlands, the rose odours, and the flowers,
    The sparkling eyes, and flashing ornaments,
    The white arms and the raven hair, the braids
    And bracelets; swanlike bosoms, and the necklace,
    An India in itself, yet dazzling not
    The eye like what it circled; the thin robes,
    Floating like light clouds 'twixt our gaze and heaven;
    The many-twinkling feet so small and sylphlike,
    Suggesting the more secret symmetry[ed]                             60
    Of the fair forms which terminate so well--
    All the delusion of the dizzy scene,
    Its false and true enchantments--Art and Nature,
    Which swam before my giddy eyes, that drank
    The sight of beauty as the parched pilgrim's
    On Arab sands the false mirage, which offers
    A lucid lake to his eluded thirst,
    Are gone. Around me are the stars and waters--
    Worlds mirrored in the Ocean, goodlier sight[ee]
    Than torches glared back by a gaudy glass;                          70
    And the great Element, which is to space
    What Ocean is to Earth, spreads its blue depths,
    Softened with the first breathings of the spring;
    The high Moon sails upon her beauteous way,
    Serenely smoothing o'er the lofty walls
    Of those tall piles and sea-girt palaces,[ef]
    Whose porphyry pillars, and whose costly fronts,
    Fraught with the Orient spoil of many marbles,
    Like altars ranged along the broad canal,
    Seem each a trophy of some mighty deed                              80
    Reared up from out the waters, scarce less strangely
    Than those more massy and mysterious giants
    Of architecture, those Titanian fabrics,
    Which point in Egypt's plains to times that have
    No other record. All is gentle: nought
    Stirs rudely; but, congenial with the night,
    Whatever walks is gliding like a spirit.
    The tinklings of some vigilant guitars
    Of sleepless lovers to a wakeful mistress,
    And cautious opening of the casement, showing                       90
    That he is not unheard; while her young hand,
    Fair as the moonlight of which it seems part,
    So delicately white, it trembles in
    The act of opening the forbidden lattice,[433]
    To let in love through music, makes his heart
    Thrill like his lyre-strings at the sight; the dash
    Phosphoric of the oar, or rapid twinkle
    Of the far lights of skimming gondolas,[434]
    And the responsive voices of the choir
    Of boatmen answering back with verse for verse;                    100
    Some dusky shadow checkering the Rialto;
    Some glimmering palace roof, or tapering spire,[eg]
    Are all the sights and sounds which here pervade
    The ocean-born and earth-commanding City--
    How sweet and soothing is this hour of calm!
    I thank thee, Night! for thou hast chased away
    Those horrid bodements which, amidst the throng,
    I could not dissipate: and with the blessing
    Of thy benign and quiet influence,
    Now will I to my couch, although to rest                           110
    Is almost wronging such a night as this,----
                                      [_A knocking is heard from without_.
    Hark! what is that? or who at such a moment?[eh]

                             _Enter_ ANTONIO.

    _Ant_. My Lord, a man without, on urgent business,
    Implores to be admitted.

    _Lioni_.                Is he a stranger?[ei]

    _Ant_. His face is muffled in his cloak, but both
    His voice and gestures seem familiar to me;[ej]
    I craved his name, but this he seemed reluctant
    To trust, save to yourself; most earnestly
    He sues to be permitted to approach you.

    _Lioni_. 'Tis a strange hour, and a suspicious bearing!            120
    And yet there is slight peril: 'tis not in
    Their houses noble men are struck at; still,
    Although I know not that I have a foe
    In Venice, 'twill be wise to use some caution.
    Admit him, and retire; but call up quickly
    Some of thy fellows, who may wait without.--
    Who can this man be?--
                    [_Exit_ ANTONIO, _and returns with_ BERTRAM _muffled_.

    _Ber_.                 My good Lord Lioni,
    I have no time to lose, nor thou,--dismiss
    This menial hence; I would be private with you.

    _Lioni_. It seems the voice of Bertram--Go, Antonio.               130
                                                          [_Exit_ ANTONIO.
    Now, stranger, what would you at such an hour?

    _Ber_. (_discovering himself_).
    A boon, my noble patron; you have granted
    Many to your poor client, Bertram; add
    This one, and make him happy.

    _Lioni_.                     Thou hast known me
    From boyhood, ever ready to assist thee
    In all fair objects of advancement, which
    Beseem one of thy station; I would promise
    Ere thy request was heard, but that the hour,
    Thy bearing, and this strange and hurried mode
    Of suing, gives me to suspect this visit                           140
    Hath some mysterious import--but say on--
    What has occurred, some rash and sudden broil?--
    A cup too much, a scuffle, and a stab?
    Mere things of every day; so that thou hast not
    Spilt noble blood, I guarantee thy safety;
    But then thou must withdraw, for angry friends
    And relatives, in the first burst of vengeance,
    Are things in Venice deadlier than the laws.

    _Ber_. My Lord, I thank you; but----

    _Lioni_.                              But what? You have not
    Raised a rash hand against one of our order?                       150
    If so--withdraw and fly--and own it not;[ek]
    I would not slay--but then I must not save thee!
    He who has shed patrician blood----

    _Ber_.                              I come
    To save patrician blood, and not to shed it!
    And thereunto I must be speedy, for
    Each minute lost may lose a life; since Time
    Has changed his slow scythe for the two-edged sword,
    And is about to take, instead of sand,
    The dust from sepulchres to fill his hour-glass!--
    Go not _thou_ forth to-morrow!

    _Lioni_.                            Wherefore not?--               160
    What means this menace?

    _Ber_.                   Do not seek its meaning,
    But do as I implore thee;--stir not forth,
    Whate'er be stirring; though the roar of crowds--
    The cry of women, and the shrieks of babes--
    The groans of men--the clash of arms--the sound
    Of rolling drum, shrill trump, and hollow bell,
    Peal in one wide alarum l--Go not forth,
    Until the Tocsin's silent, nor even then
    Till I return!

    _Lioni_.        Again, what does this mean?

    _Ber_. Again, I tell thee, ask not; but by all                     170
    Thou holdest dear on earth or Heaven--by all
    The Souls of thy great fathers, and thy hope
    To emulate them, and to leave behind
    Descendants worthy both of them and thee--
    By all thou hast of blessed in hope or memory--
    By all thou hast to fear here or hereafter--
    By all the good deeds thou hast done to me,
    Good I would now repay with greater good,[el]
    Remain within--trust to thy household gods,[em]
    And to my word for safety, if thou dost,                           180
    As I now counsel--but if not, thou art lost!

    _Lioni_. I am indeed already lost in wonder;
    Surely thou ravest! what have _I_ to dread?
    Who are my foes? or if there be such, _why_
    Art _thou_ leagued with them?--_thou!_ or, if so leagued,
    Why comest thou to tell me at this hour,
    And not before?

    _Ber_.          I cannot answer this.
    Wilt thou go forth despite of this true warning?

    _Lioni_. I was not born to shrink from idle threats,
    The cause of which I know not: at the hour                         190
    Of council, be it soon or late, I shall not
    Be found among the absent.

    _Ber_.                      Say not so!
    Once more, art thou determined to go forth?

    _Lioni_. I am. Nor is there aught which shall impede me!

    _Ber_. Then, Heaven have mercy on thy soul!--Farewell!
                                                                 [_Going_.

    _Lioni_. Stay--there is more in this than my own safety
    Which makes me call thee back; we must not part thus:
    Bertram, I have known thee long.

    _Ber_.                          From childhood, Signor,
    You have been my protector: in the days
    Of reckless infancy, when rank forgets,                            200
    Or, rather, is not yet taught to remember
    Its cold prerogative, we played together;
    Our sports, our smiles, our tears, were mingled oft;
    My father was your father's client, I
    His son's scarce less than foster-brother; years
    Saw us together--happy, heart-full hours!
    Oh God! the difference 'twixt those hours and this!

    _Lioni_. Bertram, 'tis thou who hast forgotten them.

    _Ber_. Nor now, nor ever; whatsoe'er betide,
    I would have saved you: when to Manhood's growth                   210
    We sprung, and you, devoted to the state,
    As suits your station, the more humble Bertram
    Was left unto the labours of the humble,
    Still you forsook me not; and if my fortunes
    Have not been towering, 'twas no fault of him
    Who ofttimes rescued and supported me,
    When struggling with the tides of Circumstance,
    Which bear away the weaker: noble blood
    Ne'er mantled in a nobler heart than thine
    Has proved to me, the poor plebeian Bertram.                       220
    Would that thy fellow Senators were like thee!

    _Lioni_. Why, what hast thou to say against the Senate?[en]

    _Ber_. Nothing.

    _Lioni_.        I know that there are angry spirits
    And turbulent mutterers of stifled treason,
    Who lurk in narrow places, and walk out
    Muffled to whisper curses to the night;
    Disbanded soldiers, discontented ruffians,
    And desperate libertines who brawl in taverns;
    _Thou_ herdest not with such: 'tis true, of late
    I have lost sight of thee, but thou wert wont                      230
    To lead a temperate life, and break thy bread
    With honest mates, and bear a cheerful aspect.
    What hath come to thee? in thy hollow eye
    And hueless cheek, and thine unquiet motions,
    Sorrow and Shame and Conscience seem at war
    To waste thee.

    _Ber_.         Rather Shame and Sorrow light
    On the accursed tyranny which rides[eo]
    The very air in Venice, and makes men
    Madden as in the last hours of the plague
    Which sweeps the soul deliriously from life!                       240

    _Lioni_. Some villains have been tampering with thee, Bertram;
    This is not thy old language, nor own thoughts;
    Some wretch has made thee drunk with disaffection:
    But thou must not be lost so; thou _wert_ good
    And kind, and art not fit for such base acts
    As Vice and Villany would put thee to:
    Confess--confide in me--thou know'st my nature.
    What is it thou and thine are bound to do,
    Which should prevent thy friend, the only son
    Of him who was a friend unto thy father,                           250
    So that our good-will is a heritage
    We should bequeath to our posterity
    Such as ourselves received it, or augmented;
    I say, what is it thou must do, that I
    Should deem thee dangerous, and keep the house
    Like a sick girl?

    _Ber_.           Nay, question me no further:
    I must be gone.----

    _Lioni_.           And I be murdered!--say,
    Was it not thus thou said'st, my gentle Bertram?

    _Ber_. Who talks of murder? what said I of murder?
    Tis false! I did not utter such a word.                            260

    _Lioni_. Thou didst not; but from out thy wolfish eye,
    So changed from what I knew it, there glares forth
    The gladiator. If _my_ life's thine object,
    Take it--I am unarmed,--and then away!
    I would not hold my breath on such a tenure[ep]
    As the capricious mercy of such things
    As thou and those who have set thee to thy task-work.

    _Ber_. Sooner than spill thy blood, I peril mine;
    Sooner than harm a hair of thine, I place
    In jeopardy a thousand heads, and some                             270
    As noble, nay, even nobler than thine own.

    _Lioni_. Aye, is it even so? Excuse me, Bertram;
    I am not worthy to be singled out
    From such exalted hecatombs--who are they
    That _are_ in danger, and that _make_ the danger?

    _Ber_. Venice, and all that she inherits, are
    Divided like a house against itself,
    And so will perish ere to-morrow's twilight!

    _Lioni_. More mysteries, and awful ones! But now,
    Or thou, or I, or both, it may be, are                             280
    Upon the verge of ruin; speak once out,
    And thou art safe and glorious: for 'tis more
    Glorious to save than slay, and slay i' the dark too--
    Fie, Bertram! that was not a craft for thee!
    How would it look to see upon a spear
    The head of him whose heart was open to thee!
    Borne by thy hand before the shuddering people?
    And such may be my doom; for here I swear,
    Whate'er the peril or the penalty
    Of thy denunciation, I go forth,                                   290
    Unless thou dost detail the cause, and show
    The consequence of all which led thee here!

    _Ber_. Is there no way to save thee? minutes fly,
    And thou art lost!--_thou_! my sole benefactor,
    The only being who was constant to me
    Through every change. Yet, make me not a traitor!
    Let me save thee--but spare my honour!

    _Lioni_.                              Where
    Can lie the honour in a league of murder?
    And who are traitors save unto the State?

    _Ber_. A league is still a compact, and more binding               300
    In honest hearts when words must stand for law;
    And in my mind, there is no traitor like
    He whose domestic treason plants the poniard[435]
    Within the breast which trusted to his truth.
    Lioni. And who will strike the steel to mine?

    _Ber_.                                       Not I;
    I could have wound my soul up to all things
    Save this. _Thou_ must not die! and think how dear
    Thy life is, when I risk so many lives,
    Nay, more, the Life of lives, the liberty
    Of future generations, _not_ to be                                 310
    The assassin thou miscall'st me:--once, once more
    I do adjure thee, pass not o'er thy threshold!

    _Lioni_. It is in vain--this moment I go forth.

    _Ber_. Then perish Venice rather than my friend!
    I will disclose--ensnare--betray--destroy--
    Oh, what a villain I become for thee!

    _Lioni_. Say, rather thy friend's saviour and the State's!--
    Speak--pause not--all rewards, all pledges for
    Thy safety and thy welfare; wealth such as
    The State accords her worthiest servants; nay,                     330
    Nobility itself I guarantee thee,
    So that thou art sincere and penitent.

    _Ber_. I have thought again: it must not be--I love thee--
    Thou knowest it--that I stand here is the proof,
    Not least though last; but having done my duty
    By thee, I now must do it by my country!
    Farewell--we meet no more in life!--farewell!

    _Lioni_. What, ho!--Antonio--Pedro--to the door!
    See that none pass--arrest this man!----

     _Enter_ ANTONIO _and other armed Domestics, who seize_ BERTRAM.

    _Lioni_ (_continues_).              Take care
    He hath no harm; bring me my sword and cloak,                      330
    And man the gondola with four oars--quick--
                                                          [_Exit_ ANTONIO.
    We will unto Giovanni Gradenigo's,
    And send for Marc Cornaro:--fear not, Bertram;
    This needful violence is for thy safety,
    No less than for the general weal.

    _Ber_.                            Where wouldst thou
    Bear me a prisoner?

    _Lioni_.             Firstly to "the Ten;"
    Next to the Doge.

    _Ber_.           To the Doge?

    _Lioni_.                           Assuredly:
    Is he not Chief of the State?

    _Ber_.                        Perhaps at sunrise--

    _Lioni_. What mean you?--but we'll know anon.

    _Ber_.                                       Art sure?

    _Lioni_. Sure as all gentle means can make; and if                 340
    They fail, you know "the Ten" and their tribunal,
    And that St. Mark's has dungeons, and the dungeons
    A rack.

    _Ber_.  Apply it then before the dawn
    Now hastening into heaven.--One more such word,
    And you shall perish piecemeal, by the death
    You think to doom to me.

                           _Re-enter_ ANTONIO.

    _Ant_.                    The bark is ready,
    My Lord, and all prepared.

    _Lioni_.                  Look to the prisoner.
    Bertram, I'll reason with thee as we go
    To the Magnifico's, sage Gradenigo.                         [_Exeunt_.


          SCENE II.--_The Ducal Palace_--_The Doge's Apartment_.

              _The_ DOGE _and his Nephew_ BERTUCCIO FALIERO.

    _Doge_. Are all the people of our house in muster?

    _Ber. F._ They are arrayed, and eager for the signal,
    Within our palace precincts at San Polo:[436]
    I come for your last orders.

    _Doge_.                     It had been
    As well had there been time to have got together,
    From my own fief, Val di Marino, more
    Of our retainers--but it is too late.

    _Ber. F._ Methinks, my Lord,'tis better as it is:
    A sudden swelling of our retinue
    Had waked suspicion; and, though fierce and trusty,                 10
    The vassals of that district are too rude
    And quick in quarrel to have long maintained
    The secret discipline we need for such
    A service, till our foes are dealt upon.

    _Doge_. True; but when once the signal has been given,
    _These_ are the men for such an enterprise;
    These city slaves have all their private bias,
    Their prejudice _against_ or _for_ this noble,
    Which may induce them to o'erdo or spare
    Where mercy may be madness; the fierce peasants,                    20
    Serfs of my county of Val di Marino,
    Would do the bidding of their lord without
    Distinguishing for love or hate his foes;
    Alike to them Marcello or Cornaro,
    A Gradenigo or a Foscari;[eq]
    They are not used to start at those vain names,
    Nor bow the knee before a civic Senate;
    A chief in armour is their Suzerain,
    And not a thing in robes.

    _Ber. F._                We are enough;
    And for the dispositions of our clients                             30
    Against the Senate I will answer.

    _Doge_.                          Well,
    The die is thrown; but for a warlike service,
    Done in the field, commend me to my peasants:
    They made the sun shine through the host of Huns
    When sallow burghers slunk back to their tents,
    And cowered to hear their own victorious trumpet.
    If there be small resistance, you will find
    These Citizens all Lions, like their Standard;[437]
    But if there's much to do, you'll wish, with me,
    A band of iron rustics at our backs.                                40

    _Ber_. Thus thinking, I must marvel you resolve
    To strike the blow so suddenly.

    _Doge_.                        Such blows
    Must be struck suddenly or never. When
    I had o'ermastered the weak false remorse
    Which yearned about my heart, too fondly yielding
    A moment to the feelings of old days,
    I was most fain to strike; and, firstly, that
    I might not yield again to such emotions;
    And, secondly, because of all these men,
    Save Israel and Philip Calendaro,                                   50
    I know not well the courage or the faith:
    To-day might find 'mongst them a traitor to us,
    As yesterday a thousand to the Senate;
    But once in, with their hilts hot in their hands,
    They must _on_ for their own sakes; one stroke struck,
    And the mere instinct of the first-born Cain,
    Which ever lurks somewhere in human hearts,
    Though Circumstance may keep it in abeyance,
    Will urge the rest on like to wolves; the sight
    Of blood to crowds begets the thirst of more,                       60
    As the first wine-cup leads to the long revel;
    And you will find a harder task to quell
    Than urge them when they _have_ commenced, but _till_
    That moment, a mere voice, a straw, a shadow,
    Are capable of turning them aside.--
    How goes the night?

    _Ber. F._          Almost upon the dawn.

    _Doge_. Then it is time to strike upon the bell.
    Are the men posted?

    _Ber. F._          By this time they are;
    But they have orders not to strike, until
    They have command from you through me in person.                    70

    _Doge_. 'Tis well.--Will the morn never put to rest
    These stars which twinkle yet o'er all the heavens?
    I am settled and bound up, and being so,
    The very effort which it cost me to
    Resolve to cleanse this Commonwealth with fire,
    Now leaves my mind more steady. I have wept,
    And trembled at the thought of this dread duty;
    But now I have put down all idle passion,
    And look the growing tempest in the face,
    As doth the pilot of an Admiral Galley:[438]                        80
    Yet (wouldst thou think it, kinsman?) it hath been
    A greater struggle to me, than when nations
    Beheld their fate merged in the approaching fight,
    Where I was leader of a phalanx, where
    Thousands were sure to perish--Yes, to spill
    The rank polluted current from the veins
    Of a few bloated despots needed more
    To steel me to a purpose such as made
    Timoleon immortal,[439] than to face
    The toils and dangers of a life of war.                             90

    _Ber. F._ It gladdens me to see your former wisdom
    Subdue the furies which so wrung you ere
    You were decided.

    _Doge_.          It was ever thus
    With me; the hour of agitation came
    In the first glimmerings of a purpose, when
    Passion had too much room to sway; but in
    The hour of action I have stood as calm
    As were the dead who lay around me: this
    They knew who made me what I am, and trusted
    To the subduing power which I preserved                            100
    Over my mood, when its first burst was spent.
    But they were not aware that there are things
    Which make revenge a virtue by reflection,
    And not an impulse of mere anger; though
    The laws sleep, Justice wakes, and injured souls
    Oft do a public right with private wrong,
    And justify their deeds unto themselves.--
    Methinks the day breaks--is it not so? look,
    Thine eyes are clear with youth;--the air puts on
    A morning freshness, and, at least to me,                          110
    The sea looks greyer through the lattice.

    _Ber. F._                                True,
    The morn is dappling in the sky.[er][440]

    _Doge_.                               Away then!
    See that they strike without delay, and with
    The first toll from St. Mark's, march on the palace
    With all our House's strength; here I will meet you;
    The Sixteen and their companies will move
    In separate columns at the self-same moment:
    Be sure you post yourself at the great Gate:
    I would not trust "the Ten" except to us--
    The rest, the rabble of patricians, may                            120
    Glut the more careless swords of those leagued with us.
    Remember that the cry is still "Saint Mark!
    The Genoese are come--ho! to the rescue!
    Saint Mark and Liberty!"--Now--now to action![es]

    _Ber. F._ Farewell then, noble Uncle! we will meet
    In freedom and true sovereignty, or never!

    _Doge_. Come hither, my Bertuccio--one embrace;
    Speed, for the day grows broader; send me soon
    A messenger to tell me how all goes
    When you rejoin our troops, and then sound--sound                  130
    The storm-bell from St. Mark's![et]
                                                [_Exit_ BERTUCCIO FALIERO.

    _Doge_ (_solus_).                 He is gone,
    And on each footstep moves a life. 'Tis done.[441]
    Now the destroying Angel hovers o'er
    Venice, and pauses ere he pours the vial,
    Even as the eagle overlooks his prey,
    And for a moment, poised in middle air,
    Suspends the motion of his mighty wings,
    Then swoops with his unerring beak.[442] Thou Day!
    That slowly walk'st the waters! march--march on--
    I would not smite i' the dark, but rather see                      140
    That no stroke errs. And you, ye blue sea waves!
    I have seen you dyed ere now, and deeply too,
    With Genoese, Saracen, and Hunnish gore,
    While that of Venice flowed too, but victorious:
    Now thou must wear an unmixed crimson; no
    Barbaric blood can reconcile us now
    Unto that horrible incarnadine,
    But friend or foe will roll in civic slaughter.
    And have I lived to fourscore years[443] for this?
    I, who was named Preserver of the City?                            150
    I, at whose name the million's caps were flung[eu]
    Into the air, and cries from tens of thousands
    Rose up, imploring Heaven to send me blessings,
    And fame, and length of days--to see this day?
    But this day, black within the calendar,
    Shall be succeeded by a bright millennium.
    Doge Dandolo survived to ninety summers
    To vanquish empires, and refuse their crown;[444]
    I will resign a crown, and make the State
    Renew its freedom--but oh! by what means?                          160
    The noble end must justify them. What
    Are a few drops of human blood? 'tis false,
    The blood of tyrants is not human; they,
    Like to incarnate Molochs, feed on ours,
    Until 'tis time to give them to the tombs
    Which they have made so populous.--Oh World!
    Oh Men! what are ye, and our best designs,
    That we must work by crime to punish crime?
    And slay as if Death had but this one gate,
    When a few years would make the sword superfluous?                 170
    And I, upon the verge of th' unknown realm,
    Yet send so many heralds on before me?--
    I must not ponder this.                                    [_A pause._
                             Hark! was there not
    A murmur as of distant voices, and
    The tramp of feet in martial unison?
    What phantoms even of sound our wishes raise!
    It cannot be--the signal hath not rung--
    Why pauses it? My nephew's messenger
    Should be upon his way to me, and he
    Himself perhaps even now draws grating back                        180
    Upon its ponderous hinge the steep tower portal,
    Where swings the sullen huge oracular bell,[ev]
    Which never knells but for a princely death,
    Or for a state in peril, pealing forth
    Tremendous bodements; let it do its office,
    And be this peal its awfullest and last
    Sound till the strong tower rock!--What! silent still?
    I would go forth, but that my post is here,
    To be the centre of re-union to
    The oft discordant elements which form                             190
    Leagues of this nature, and to keep compact
    The wavering of the weak, in case of conflict;
    For if they should do battle,'twill be here,
    Within the palace, that the strife will thicken:
    Then here must be my station, as becomes
    The master-mover.--Hark! he comes--he comes,
    My nephew, brave Bertuccio's messenger.--
    What tidings? Is he marching? hath he sped?
    _They_ here!-all's lost-yet will I make an effort.

      _Enter a_ SIGNOR OF THE NIGHT,[445] _with Guards, etc., etc._

    _Sig_. Doge, I arrest thee of high treason!

    _Doge_.                                     Me!                    200
    Thy Prince, of treason?--Who are they that dare
    Cloak their own treason under such an order?

    _Sig_. (_showing his order_).
    Behold my order from the assembled Ten.

    _Doge_. And _where_ are they, and _why_ assembled? no
    Such Council can be lawful, till the Prince
    Preside there, and that duty's mine:[446] on thine
    I charge thee, give me way, or marshal me
    To the Council chamber.

    _Sig_.                 Duke! it may not be:
    Nor are they in the wonted Hall of Council,
    But sitting in the convent of Saint Saviour's.                     210

    _Doge_. You dare to disobey me, then?

    _Sig_.                                I serve
    The State, and needs must serve it faithfully;
    My warrant is the will of those who rule it.

    _Doge_. And till that warrant has my signature
    It is illegal, and, as _now_ applied,
    Rebellious. Hast thou weighed well thy life's worth,
    That thus you dare assume a lawless function?[ew]

    _Sig_. 'Tis not my office to reply, but act--
    I am placed here as guard upon thy person,
    And not as judge to hear or to decide.                             220

    _Doge_ (_aside_).
    I must gain time. So that the storm-bell sound,[ex][447]
    All may be well yet. Kinsman, speed--speed--speed!--
    Our fate is trembling in the balance, and
    Woe to the vanquished! be they Prince and people,
    Or slaves and Senate--
                                    [_The great bell of St. Mark's tolls._
                          Lo! it sounds--it tolls!

    _Doge_ (_aloud_).
    Hark, Signor of the Night! and you, ye hirelings,
    Who wield your mercenary staves in fear,
    It is your knell.--Swell on, thou lusty peal!
    Now, knaves, what ransom for your lives?

    _Sig_.                                  Confusion!
    Stand to your arms, and guard the door--all's lost                 230
    Unless that fearful bell be silenced soon.
    The officer hath missed his path or purpose,
    Or met some unforeseen and hideous obstacle,[ey]
    Anselmo, with thy company proceed
    Straight to the tower; the rest remain with me.
                                                [_Exit part of the Guard._

    _Doge_. Wretch! if thou wouldst have thy vile life, implore it;
    It is not now a lease of sixty seconds.
    Aye, send thy miserable ruffians forth;
    They never shall return.

    _Sig_.                     So let it be!
    They die then in their duty, as will I.                            240

    _Doge_. Fool! the high eagle flies at nobler game
    Than thou and thy base myrmidons,--live on,
    So thou provok'st not peril by resistance,
    And learn (if souls so much obscured can bear
    To gaze upon the sunbeams) to be free.

    _Sig_.  And learn thou to be captive. It hath ceased,
                                               [_The bell ceases to toll_.
    The traitorous signal, which was to have set
    The bloodhound mob on their patrician prey--
    The knell hath rung, but it is not the Senate's!

    _Doge_ (_after a pause_).
    All's silent, and all's lost!

    _Sig_.                       Now, Doge, denounce me                250
    As rebel slave of a revolted Council!
    Have I not done my duty?

    _Doge_.                  Peace, thou thing!
    Thou hast done a worthy deed, and earned the price
    Of blood, and they who use thee will reward thee.
    But thou wert sent to watch, and not to prate,
    As thou said'st even now--then do thine office,
    But let it be in silence, as behoves thee,
    Since, though thy prisoner, I am thy Prince.

    _Sig_. I did not mean to fail in the respect
    Due to your rank: in this I shall obey you.                        260

    _Doge_ (_aside_). There now is nothing left me save to die;
    And yet how near success! I would have fallen,
    And proudly, in the hour of triumph, but
    To miss it thus!----

                _Enter other_ SIGNORS OF THE NIGHT, _with_
                      BERTUCCIO FALIERO _prisoner_.

    _2nd Sig_.             We took him in the act
    Of issuing from the tower, where, at his order,
    As delegated from the Doge, the signal
    Had thus begun to sound.

    _1st Sig_.                Are all the passes
    Which lead up to the palace well secured?

    _2nd Sig_. They are--besides, it matters not; the Chiefs
    Are all in chains, and some even now on trial--                    270
    Their followers are dispersed, and many taken.

    _Ber. F._ Uncle!

    _Doge_.           It is in vain to war with Fortune;
    The glory hath departed from our house.

    _Ber. F._ Who would have deemed it?--Ah! one moment sooner!

    _Doge_. That moment would have changed the face of ages;
    _This_ gives us to Eternity--We'll meet it
    As men whose triumph is not in success,
    But who can make their own minds all in all,
    Equal to every fortune. Droop not,'tis
    But a brief passage--I would go alone,                             280
    Yet if they send us, as 'tis like, together,
    Let us go worthy of our sires and selves.

    _Ber. F._ I shall not shame you, Uncle.

    _1st Sig_.                             Lords, our orders
    Are to keep guard on both in separate chambers,
    Until the Council call ye to your trial.

    _Doge_. Our trial! will they keep their mockery up
    Even to the last? but let them deal upon us,
    As we had dealt on them, but with less pomp.
    'Tis but a game of mutual homicides,
    Who have cast lots for the first death, and they                   290
    Have won with false dice.--Who hath been our Judas?

    _1st Sig_. I am not warranted to answer that.

    _Ber. F._ I'll answer for thee--'tis a certain Bertram,
    Even now deposing to the secret Giunta.

    _Doge_. Bertram, the Bergamask! With what vile tools[448]
    We operate to slay or save! This creature,
    Black with a double treason, now will earn
    Rewards and honours, and be stamped in story
    With the geese in the Capitol, which gabbled
    Till Rome awoke, and had an annual triumph,                        300
    While Manlius, who hurled down the Gauls, was cast[ez]
    From the Tarpeian.

    _1st Sig_.          He aspired to treason,
    And sought to rule the State.

    _Doge_.                       He saved the State,
    And sought but to reform what he revived--
    But this is idle--Come, sirs, do your work.

    _1st Sig_. Noble Bertuccio, we must now remove you
    Into an inner chamber.

    _Ber. F._               Farewell, Uncle!
    If we shall meet again in life I know not,
    But they perhaps will let our ashes mingle.

    _Doge_. Yes, and our spirits, which shall yet go forth,            310
    And do what our frail clay, thus clogged, hath failed in!
    They cannot quench the memory of those
    Who would have hurled them from their guilty thrones,
    And such examples will find heirs, though distant.




                                  ACT V.


 SCENE 1.--_The Hall of the Council of Ten assembled with the additional
   Senators, who, on the Trials of the Conspirators for the Treason of_
 MARINO FALIERO, _composed what was called the Giunta,--Guards, Officers,
   etc., etc._ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO _and_ PHILIP CALENDARO _as Prisoners_.
                  BERTRAM, LIONI, _and Witnesses, etc._

               _The Chief of the Ten_, BENINTENDE.[fa][449]

    _Ben_. There now rests, after such conviction of
    Their manifold and manifest offences,
    But to pronounce on these obdurate men
    The sentence of the Law:--a grievous task
    To those who hear, and those who speak. Alas!
    That it should fall to me! and that my days
    Of office should be stigmatised through all
    The years of coming time, as bearing record
    To this most foul and complicated treason
    Against a just and free state, known to all                         10
    The earth as being the Christian bulwark 'gainst
    The Saracen and the schismatic Greek,
    The savage Hun, and not less barbarous Frank;
    A City which has opened India's wealth
    To Europe; the last Roman refuge from
    O'erwhelming Attila; the Ocean's Queen;
    Proud Genoa's prouder rival! 'Tis to sap
    The throne of such a City, these lost men
    Have risked and forfeited their worthless lives--
    So let them die the death.

    _I. Ber_.                  We are prepared;                         20
    Your racks have done that for us. Let us die.

    _Ben_. If ye have that to say which would obtain
    Abatement of your punishment, the Giunta
    Will hear you; if you have aught to confess,
    Now is your time,--perhaps it may avail ye.

    _I. Ber_. We stand to hear, and not to speak.

    _Ben_.                                       Your crimes
    Are fully proved by your accomplices,
    And all which Circumstance can add to aid them;
    Yet we would hear from your own lips complete
    Avowal of your treason: on the verge                                30
    Of that dread gulf which none repass, the truth
    Alone can profit you on earth or Heaven--
    Say, then, what was your motive?

    _I. Ber_.                         Justice![fb]

    _Ben_.                                      What
    Your object?

    _I. Ber_.   Freedom!

    _Ben_.              You are brief, sir.

    _I. Ber_. So my life grows: I
    Was bred a soldier, not a senator.

    _Ben_. Perhaps you think by this blunt brevity
    To brave your judges to postpone the sentence?

    _I. Ber_. Do you be brief as I am, and believe me,
    I shall prefer that mercy to your pardon.                           40

    _Ben_. Is this your sole reply to the Tribunal?

    _I. Ber_. Go, ask your racks what they have wrung from us,
    Or place us there again; we have still some blood left,
    And some slight sense of pain in these wrenched limbs:
    But this ye dare not do; for if we die there--
    And you have left us little life to spend
    Upon your engines, gorged with pangs already--
    Ye lose the public spectacle, with which
    You would appal your slaves to further slavery!
    Groans are not words, nor agony assent,                             50
    Nor affirmation Truth, if Nature's sense
    Should overcome the soul into a lie,
    For a short respite--must we bear or die?

    _Ben_. Say, who were your accomplices?

    _I. Ber_.                              The Senate.

    _Ben_. What do you mean?

    _I. Ber_.                 Ask of the suffering people,
    Whom your patrician crimes have driven to crime.

    _Ben_. You know the Doge?

    _I. Ber_.                  I served with him at Zara
    In the field, when _you_ were pleading here your way
    To present office; we exposed our lives,
    While you but hazarded the lives of others,                         60
    Alike by accusation or defence;
    And for the rest, all Venice knows her Doge,
    Through his great actions, and the Senate's insults.

    _Ben_. You have held conference with him?

    _I. Ber_.                                I am weary--
    Even wearier of your questions than your tortures:
    I pray you pass to judgment.

    _Ben_.                         It is coming.
    And you, too, Philip Calendaro, what
    Have you to say why you should not be doomed?

    _Cal_. I never was a man of many words,
    And now have few left worth the utterance.                          70

    _Ben_. A further application of yon engine
    May change your tone.

    _Cal_.                 Most true, it _will_ do so;
    A former application did so; but
    It will not change my words, or, if it did--

    _Ben_. What then?

    _Cal_.             Will my avowal on yon rack
    Stand good in law?

    _Ben_.             Assuredly.

    _Cal_.                          Whoe'er
    The culprit be whom I accuse of treason?

    _Ben_. Without doubt, he will be brought up to trial.

    _Cal_. And on this testimony would he perish?

    _Ben_. So your confession be detailed and full,                     80
    He will stand here in peril of his life.

    _Cal_. Then look well to thy proud self, President!
    For by the Eternity which yawns before me,
    I swear that _thou_, and only thou, shall be
    The traitor I denounce upon that rack,
    If I be stretched there for the second time.

    _One of the Giunta_. Lord President,'twere best proceed to judgment;
    There is no more to be drawn from these men.[fc]

    _Ben_. Unhappy men! prepare for instant death.
    The nature of your crime--our law--and peril                        90
    The State now stands in, leave not an hour's respite.
    Guards! lead them forth, and upon the balcony
    Of the red columns, where, on festal Thursday,[450]
    The Doge stands to behold the chase of bulls,
    Let them be justified: and leave exposed
    Their wavering relics, in the place of judgment,
    To the full view of the assembled people!
    And Heaven have mercy on their souls!

    _The Giunta_.                           Amen!

    _I. Ber_. Signors, farewell! we shall not all again
    Meet in one place.

    _Ben_.            And lest they should essay                       100
    To stir up the distracted multitude--
    Guards! let their mouths be gagged[451] even in the act
    Of execution. Lead them hence!

    _Cal_.                        What! must we
    Not even say farewell to some fond friend,
    Nor leave a last word with our confessor?

    _Ben_. A priest is waiting in the antechamber;
    But, for your friends, such interviews would be
    Painful to them, and useless all to you.

    _Cal_. I knew that we were gagged in life; at least
    All those who had not heart to risk their lives                    110
    Upon their open thoughts; but still I deemed
    That in the last few moments, the same idle
    Freedom of speech accorded to the dying,
    Would not now be denied to us; but since----

    _I. Ber_. Even let them have their way, brave Calendaro!
    What matter a few syllables? let's die
    Without the slightest show of favour from them;
    So shall our blood more readily arise
    To Heaven against them, and more testify
    To their atrocities, than could a volume                           120
    Spoken or written of our dying words!
    They tremble at our voices--nay, they dread
    Our very silence--let them live in fear!
    Leave them unto their thoughts, and let us now
    Address our own above!--Lead on; we are ready.

    _Cal_. Israel, hadst thou but hearkened unto me
    It had not now been thus; and yon pale villain,
    The coward Bertram, would----

    _I. Ber_.                      Peace, Calendaro!
    What brooks it now to ponder upon this?

    _Bert_. Alas! I fain you died in peace with me:                    130
    I did not seek this task; 'twas forced upon me:
    Say, you forgive me, though I never can
    Retrieve my own forgiveness--frown not thus!

    _I. Ber_. I die and pardon thee!

    _Cal_. (_spitting at him_).[452] I die and scorn thee!
         [_Exeunt_ ISRAEL BERTUCCIO _and_ PHILIP CALENDARO, _Guards, etc_.

    _Ben_. Now that these criminals have been disposed of,
    'Tis time that we proceed to pass our sentence
    Upon the greatest traitor upon record
    In any annals, the Doge Faliero!
    The proofs and process are complete; the time
    And crime require a quick procedure: shall                         140
    He now be called in to receive the award?

    _The Giunta_. Aye, aye.

    _Ben_.                   Avogadori, order that the Doge
    Be brought before the Council.

    _One of the Giunta_.            And the rest,
    When shall they be brought up?

    _Ben_.                          When all the Chiefs
    Have been disposed of. Some have fled to Chiozza;
    But there are thousands in pursuit of them,
    And such precaution ta'en on terra firma,
    As well as in the islands, that we hope
    None will escape to utter in strange lands
    His libellous tale of treasons 'gainst the Senate.                 150

         _Enter the_ DOGE _as Prisoner, with Guards, etc., etc._

    _Ben_. Doge--for such still you are, and by the law
    Must be considered, till the hour shall come
    When you must doff the Ducal Bonnet from
    That head, which could not wear a crown more noble
    Than Empires can confer, in quiet honour,
    But it must plot to overthrow your peers,
    Who made you what you are, and quench in blood
    A City's glory--we have laid already
    Before you in your chamber at full length,
    By the Avogadori, all the proofs                                   160
    Which have appeared against you; and more ample
    Ne'er reared their sanguinary shadows to
    Confront a traitor. What have you to say
    In your defence?

    _Doge_.            What shall I say to ye,
    Since my defence must be your condemnation?
    You are at once offenders and accusers,
    Judges and Executioners!--Proceed
    Upon your power.

    _Ben_.             Your chief accomplices
    Having confessed, there is no hope for you.

    _Doge_. And who be they?

    _Ben_.                    In number many; but                      170
    The first now stands before you in the court,
    Bertram of Bergamo,--would you question him?

    _Doge_ (_looking at him contemptuously_).        No.

    _Ben_. And two others, Israel Bertuccio,
    And Philip Calendaro, have admitted
    Their fellowship in treason with the Doge!

    _Doge_. And where are they?

    _Ben_.                    Gone to their place, and now
    Answering to Heaven for what they did on earth.

    _Doge_. Ah! the plebeian Brutus, is he gone?
    And the quick Cassius of the arsenal?--
    How did they meet their doom?

    _Ben_.                        Think of your own:                   180
    It is approaching. You decline to plead, then?[fd]

    _Doge_. I cannot plead to my inferiors, nor
    Can recognise your legal power to try me.
    Show me the law!

    _Ben_.           On great emergencies,
    The law must be remodelled or amended:
    Our fathers had not fixed the punishment
    Of such a crime, as on the old Roman tables
    The sentence against parricide was left
    In pure forgetfulness; they could not render
    That penal, which had neither name nor thought                     190
    In their great bosoms; who would have foreseen
    That Nature could be filed to such a crime[453]
    As sons 'gainst sires, and princes 'gainst their realms?
    Your sin hath made us make a law which will
    Become a precedent 'gainst such haught traitors,
    As would with treason mount to tyranny;
    Not even contented with a sceptre, till
    They can convert it to a two-edged sword!
    Was not the place of Doge sufficient for ye?
    What's nobler than the signory[454] of Venice?                     200

    _Doge_. The signory of Venice! You betrayed me--
    _You--you_, who sit there, traitors as ye are!
    From my equality with you in birth,
    And my superiority in action,
    You drew me from my honourable toils
    In distant lands--on flood, in field, in cities--
    _You_ singled me out like a victim to
    Stand crowned, but bound and helpless, at the altar
    Where you alone could minister. I knew not,
    I sought not, wished not, dreamed not the election,                210
    Which reached me first at Rome, and I obeyed;
    But found on my arrival, that, besides
    The jealous vigilance which always led you
    To mock and mar your Sovereign's best intents,
    You had, even in the interregnum[455] of
    My journey to the capital, curtailed
    And mutilated the few privileges
    Yet left the Duke: all this I bore, and would
    Have borne, until my very hearth was stained
    By the pollution of your ribaldry,                                 220
    And he, the ribald, whom I see amongst you--
    Fit judge in such tribunal!----

    _Ben_. (_interrupting him_).        Michel Steno
    Is here in virtue of his office, as
    One of the Forty; "the Ten" having craved
    A Giunta of patricians from the Senate
    To aid our judgment in a trial arduous
    And novel as the present: he was set
    Free from the penalty pronounced upon him,
    Because the Doge, who should protect the law,
    Seeking to abrogate all law, can claim                             230
    No punishment of others by the statutes
    Which he himself denies and violates!

    _Doge_. _His_ punishment! I rather see him _there_,
    Where he now sits, to glut him with my death,
    Than in the mockery of castigation,
    Which your foul, outward, juggling show of justice
    Decreed as sentence! Base as was his crime,
    'Twas purity compared with your protection.

    _Ben_. And can it be, that the great Doge of Venice,
    With three parts of a century of years                             240
    And honours on his head, could thus allow
    His fury, like an angry boy's, to master
    All Feeling, Wisdom, Faith and Fear, on such
    A provocation as a young man's petulance?

    _Doge_. A spark creates the flame--'tis the last drop
    Which makes the cup run o'er, and mine was full
    Already: you oppressed the Prince and people;
    I would have freed both, and have failed in both:
    The price of such success would have been glory,
    Vengeance, and victory, and such a name                            250
    As would have made Venetian history
    Rival to that of Greece and Syracuse
    When they were freed, and flourished ages after,
    And mine to Gelon and to Thrasybulus:[456]
    Failing, I know the penalty of failure
    Is present infamy and death--the future
    Will judge, when Venice is no more, or free;
    Till then, the truth is in abeyance. Pause not;
    I would have shown no mercy, and I seek none;
    My life was staked upon a mighty hazard,                           260
    And being lost, take what I would have taken!
    I would have stood alone amidst your tombs:
    Now you may flock round mine, and trample on it,
    As you have done upon my heart while living.[457]

    _Ben_. You do confess then, and admit the justice
    Of our Tribunal?

    _Doge_.            I confess to have failed;
    Fortune is female: from my youth her favours
    Were not withheld, the fault was mine to hope
    Her former smiles again at this late hour.

    _Ben_. You do not then in aught arraign our equity?                270

    _Doge_. Noble Venetians! stir me not with questions.
    I am resigned to the worst; but in me still
    Have something of the blood of brighter days,
    And am not over-patient. Pray you, spare me
    Further interrogation, which boots nothing,
    Except to turn a trial to debate.
    I shall but answer that which will offend you,
    And please your enemies--a host already;
    'Tis true, these sullen walls should yield no echo:
    But walls have ears--nay, more, they have tongues; and if          280
    There were no other way for Truth to o'erleap them,[fe]
    You who condemn me, you who fear and slay me,
    Yet could not bear in silence to your graves
    What you would hear from me of Good or Evil;
    The secret were too mighty for your souls:
    Then let it sleep in mine, unless you court
    A danger which would double that you escape.
    Such my defence would be, had I full scope
    To make it famous; for true _words_ are _things_,
    And dying men's are things which long outlive,                     290
    And oftentimes avenge them; bury mine,
    If ye would fain survive me: take this counsel,
    And though too oft ye make me live in wrath,
    Let me die calmly; you may grant me this;
    I deny nothing--defend nothing--nothing
    I ask of you, but silence for myself,
    And sentence from the Court!

    _Ben_.                        This full admission
    Spares us the harsh necessity of ordering
    The torture to elicit the whole truth.[ff]

    _Doge_. The torture! you have put me there already,                300
    Daily since I was Doge; but if you will
    Add the corporeal rack, you may: these limbs
    Will yield with age to crushing iron; but
    There's that within my heart shall strain your engines.

                           _Enter an_ OFFICER.

    _Officer_. Noble Venetians! Duchess Faliero[fg]
    Requests admission to the Giunta's presence.

    _Ben_. Say, Conscript Fathers,[458] shall she be admitted?

    _One of the Giunta_.  She may have revelations of importance
    Unto the state, to justify compliance
    With her request.

    _Ben_.              Is this the general will?                      310

    _All_. It is.

    _Doge_.         Oh, admirable laws of Venice!
    Which would admit the wife, in the full hope
    That she might testify against the husband.
    What glory to the chaste Venetian dames!
    But such blasphemers 'gainst all Honour, as
    Sit here, do well to act in their vocation.
    Now, villain Steno! if this woman fail,
    I'll pardon thee thy lie, and thy escape,
    And my own violent death, and thy vile life.

                         _The_ DUCHESS _enters_.

    _Ben_. Lady! this just Tribunal has resolved,                      320
    Though the request be strange, to grant it, and
    Whatever be its purport, to accord
    A patient hearing with the due respect
    Which fits your ancestry, your rank, and virtues:
    But you turn pale--ho! there, look to the Lady!
    Place a chair instantly.

    _Ang_.                   A moment's faintness--
    'Tis past; I pray you pardon me,--I sit not
    In presence of my Prince and of my husband,
    While he is on his feet.

    _Ben_.                    Your pleasure, Lady?

    _Ang_. Strange rumours, but most true, if all I hear               330
    And see be sooth, have reached me, and I come
    To know the worst, even at the worst; forgive
    The abruptness of my entrance and my bearing.
    Is it--I cannot speak--I cannot shape
    The question--but you answer it ere spoken,
    With eyes averted, and with gloomy brows--
    Oh God! this is the silence of the grave!

    _Ben_. (_after a pause_). Spare us, and spare thyself the repetition
    Of our most awful, but inexorable
    Duty to Heaven and man!

    _Ang_.                 Yet speak; I cannot--                       340
    I cannot--no--even now believe these things.
    Is _he_ condemned?

    _Ben_.            Alas!

    _Ang_.                   And was he guilty?

    _Ben_. Lady! the natural distraction of
    Thy thoughts at such a moment makes the question
    Merit forgiveness; else a doubt like this
    Against a just and paramount tribunal
    Were deep offence. But question even the Doge,
    And if he can deny the proofs, believe him
    Guiltless as thy own bosom.

    _Ang_.                       Is it so?
    My Lord, my Sovereign, my poor father's friend,                    350
    The mighty in the field, the sage in Council,
    Unsay the words of this man!--thou art silent!

    _Ben_. He hath already owned to his own guilt,[fh]
    Nor, as thou see'st, doth he deny it now.

    _Ang_. Aye, but he must not die! Spare his few years,
    Which Grief and Shame will soon cut down to days!
    One day of baffled crime must not efface
    Near sixteen lustres crowned with brave acts.

    _Ben_. His doom must be fulfilled without remission
    Of time or penalty--'tis a decree.                                 360

    _Ang_. He hath been guilty, but there may be mercy.

    _Ben_. Not in this case with justice.

    _Ang_.                                 Alas! Signor,
    He who is only just is cruel; who
    Upon the earth would live were all judged justly?

    _Ben_. His punishment is safety to the State.

    _Ang_. He was a subject, and hath served the State;
    He was your General, and hath saved the State;
    He is your Sovereign, and hath ruled the State.[fi]

    _One of the Council_. He is a traitor, and betrayed the State.

    _Ang_. And, but for him, there now had been no State               370
    To save or to destroy; and you, who sit
    There to pronounce the death of your deliverer,
    Had now been groaning at a Moslem oar,
    Or digging in the Hunnish mines in fetters!

    _One of the Council_. No, Lady, there are others who would die
    Rather than breathe in slavery!

    _Ang_.                           If there are so
    Within _these_ walls, _thou_ art not of the number:
    The truly brave are generous to the fallen!--
    Is there no hope?

    _Ben_.             Lady, it cannot be.

    _Ang_. (_turning to the Doge_).
    Then die, Faliero! since it must be so;                            380
    But with the spirit of my father's friend.
    Thou hast been guilty of a great offence,
    Half cancelled by the harshness of these men.
    I would have sued to them, have prayed to them.
    Have begged as famished mendicants for bread,
    Have wept as they will cry unto their God
    For mercy, and be answered as they answer,--
    Had it been fitting for thy name or mine,
    And if the cruelty in their cold eyes
    Had not announced the heartless wrath within.                      390
    Then, as a Prince, address thee to thy doom!

    _Doge_. I have lived too long not to know how to die!
    Thy suing to these men were but the bleating
    Of the lamb to the butcher, or the cry
    Of seamen to the surge: I would not take
    A life eternal, granted at the hands
    Of wretches, from whose monstrous villanies
    I sought to free the groaning nations!

    _Michel Steno_.                        Doge,
    A word with thee, and with this noble lady,
    Whom I have grievously offended. Would                             400
    Sorrow, or shame, or penance on my part,
    Could cancel the inexorable past!
    But since that cannot be, as Christians let us
    Say farewell, and in peace: with full contrition
    I crave, not pardon, but compassion from you,
    And give, however weak, my prayers for both.

    _Ang_. Sage Benintende, now chief Judge of Venice,
    I speak to thee in answer to yon Signor.
    Inform the ribald Steno, that his words
    Ne'er weighed in mind with Loredano's daughter,                    410
    Further than to create a moment's pity
    For such as he is: would that others had
    Despised him as I pity! I prefer
    My honour to a thousand lives, could such
    Be multiplied in mine, but would not have
    A single life of others lost for that
    Which nothing human can impugn--the sense
    Of Virtue, looking not to what is called
    A good name for reward, but to itself.
    To me the scorner's words were as the wind                         420
    Unto the rock: but as there are--alas!
    Spirits more sensitive, on which such things
    Light as the Whirlwind on the waters; souls
    To whom Dishonour's shadow is a substance
    More terrible than Death, here and hereafter;
    Men whose vice is to start at Vice's scoffing,
    And who, though proof against all blandishments
    Of pleasure, and all pangs of Pain, are feeble
    When the proud name on which they pinnacled
    Their hopes is breathed on, jealous as the eagle                   430
    Of her high aiery;[459] let what we now[fj]
    Behold, and feel, and suffer, be a lesson
    To wretches how they tamper in their spleen
    With beings of a higher order. Insects
    Have made the lion mad ere now; a shaft
    I' the heel o'erthrew the bravest of the brave;
    A wife's Dishonour was the bane of Troy;
    A wife's Dishonour unkinged Rome for ever;
    An injured husband brought the Gauls to Clusium,
    And thence to Rome, which perished for a time;                     440
    An obscene gesture cost Caligula[460]
    His life, while Earth yet bore his cruelties;
    A virgin's wrong made Spain a Moorish province;
    And Steno's lie, couched in two worthless lines,
    Hath decimated Venice, put in peril
    A Senate which hath stood eight hundred years,
    Discrowned a Prince, cut off his crownless head,
    And forged new fetters for a groaning people!
    Let the poor wretch, like to the courtesan[461]
    Who fired Persepolis, be proud of this,                            450
    If it so please him--'twere a pride fit for him!
    But let him not insult the last hours of
    Him, who, whate'er he now is, _was_ a Hero,
    By the intrusion of his very prayers;
    Nothing of good can come from such a source,
    Nor would we aught with him, nor now, nor ever:
    We leave him to himself, that lowest depth
    Of human baseness. Pardon is for men,
    And not for reptiles--we have none for Steno,
    And no resentment: things like him must sting,                     460
    And higher beings suffer; 'tis the charter
    Of Life. The man who dies by the adder's fang
    May have the crawler crushed, but feels no anger:
    'Twas the worm's nature; and some men are worms
    In soul, more than the living things of tombs.[462]

    _Doge_ (_to Ben._).
    Signor! complete that which you deem your duty.[fk]

    _Ben_. Before we can proceed upon that duty,
    We would request the Princess to withdraw;
    'Twill move her too much to be witness to it.

    _Ang_. I know it will, and yet I must endure it,                   470
    For 'tis a part of mine--I will not quit,
    Except by force, my husband's side--Proceed!
    Nay, fear not either shriek, or sigh, or tear;
    Though my heart burst, it shall be silent.--Speak!
    I have that within which shall o'ermaster all.

    _Ben_. Marino Faliero, Doge of Venice,
    Count of Val di Marino, Senator,
    And some time General of the Fleet and Army,
    Noble Venetian, many times and oft
    Intrusted by the state with high employments,                      480
    Even to the highest, listen to the sentence.
    Convict by many witnesses and proofs,
    And by thine own confession, of the guilt
    Of Treachery and Treason, yet unheard of[fl]
    Until this trial--the decree is Death--
    Thy goods are confiscate unto the State,
    Thy name is razed from out her records, save
    Upon a public day of thanksgiving
    For this our most miraculous deliverance,[fm]
    When thou art noted in our calendars                               490
    With earthquakes, pestilence, and foreign foes,
    And the great Enemy of man, as subject
    Of grateful masses for Heaven's grace in snatching
    Our lives and country from thy wickedness.
    The place wherein as Doge thou shouldst be painted
    With thine illustrious predecessors, is
    To be left vacant, with a death-black veil
    Flung over these dim words engraved beneath,--
    "This place is of Marino Faliero,
    Decapitated for his crimes."[463]

    _Doge_.                         "His _crimes_!"[464]500
    But let it be so:--it will be in vain.
    The veil which blackens o'er this blighted name,
    And hides, or seems to hide, these lineaments,
    Shall draw more gazers than the thousand portraits
    Which glitter round it in their pictured trappings--
    _Your_ delegated slaves--the people's tyrants!
    "Decapitated for his crimes!"--_What_ crimes?
    Were it not better to record the facts,
    So that the contemplator might approve,
    Or at the least learn _whence_ the crimes arose?                   510
    When the beholder knows a Doge conspired,
    Let him be told the cause--it is your history.

    _Ben_. Time must reply to that; our sons will judge
    Their fathers' judgment, which I now pronounce.
    As Doge, clad in the ducal robes and Cap,
    Thou shalt be led hence to the Giants' Staircase,
    Where thou and all our Princes are invested;
    And there, the Ducal Crown being first resumed
    Upon the spot where it was first assumed,
    Thy head shall be struck off; and Heaven have mercy                520
    Upon thy soul!

    _Doge_.          Is this the Giunta's sentence?

    _Ben_. It is.

    _Doge_.       I can endure it.--And the time?

    _Ben_. Must be immediate.--Make thy peace with God:
    Within an hour thou must be in His presence.

    _Doge_. I am _already_; and my blood will rise
    To Heaven before the souls of those who shed it.
    Are all my lands confiscated?[465]

    _Ben_.                         They are;
    And goods, and jewels, and all kind of treasure,
    Except two thousand ducats--these dispose of.

    _Doge_. That's harsh.--I would have fain reserved the lands        530
    Near to Treviso, which I hold by investment
    From Laurence the Count-bishop of Ceneda,[fn]
    In fief perpetual to myself and heirs,
    To portion them (leaving my city spoil,
    My palace and my treasures, to your forfeit)
    Between my consort and my kinsmen.

    _Ben_.                               These
    Lie under the state's ban--their Chief, thy nephew,
    In peril of his own life; but the Council
    Postpones his trial for the present. If
    Thou will'st a state unto thy widowed Princess,                    540
    Fear not, for we will do her justice.

    _Ang_.                                 Signors,
    I share not in your spoil! From henceforth, know
    I am devoted unto God alone,
    And take my refuge in the cloister.

    _Doge_.                             Come!
    The hour may be a hard one, but 'twill end.
    Have I aught else to undergo save Death?[fo]

    _Ben_. You have nought to do, except confess and die.
    The priest is robed, the scimitar is bare,
    And both await without.--But, above all,
    Think not to speak unto the people; they                           550
    Are now by thousands swarming at the gates,
    But these are closed: the Ten, the Avogadori,
    The Giunta, and the chief men of the Forty,
    Alone will be beholders of thy doom,
    And they are ready to attend the Doge.

    _Doge_. The Doge!

    _Ben_.           Yes, Doge, thou hast lived and thou shalt die
    A Sovereign; till the moment which precedes
    The separation of that head and trunk,
    That ducal crown and head shall be united.
    Thou hast forgot thy dignity in deigning                           560
    To plot with petty traitors; not so we,
    Who in the very punishment acknowledge
    The Prince. Thy vile accomplices have died
    The dog's death, and the wolf's; but them shall fall
    As falls the lion by the hunters, girt
    By those who feel a proud compassion for thee,
    And mourn even the inevitable death
    Provoked by thy wild wrath, and regal fierceness.
    Now we remit thee to thy preparation:
    Let it be brief, and we ourselves will be                          570
    Thy guides unto the place where first we were
    United to thee as thy subjects, and
    Thy Senate; and must now be parted from thee
    As such for ever, on the self-same spot.
    Guards! form the Doge's escort to his chamber.
                                                                [_Exeunt_.


                    SCENE II.--_The Doge's Apartment_.

        _The_ DOGE _as Prisoner, and the_ DUCHESS _attending him_.

    _Doge_. Now, that the priest is gone, 'twere useless all
    To linger out the miserable minutes;
    But one pang more, the pang of parting from thee,
    And I will leave the few last grains of sand,
    Which yet remain of the accorded hour,
    Still falling--I have done with Time.

    _Ang_.                                Alas!
    And I have been the cause, the unconscious cause;
    And for this funeral marriage, this black union,
    Which thou, compliant with my father's wish,
    Didst promise at _his_ death, thou hast sealed thine own.           10

    _Doge_. Not so: there was that in my spirit ever
    Which shaped out for itself some great reverse;
    The marvel is, it came not until now--
    And yet it was foretold me.

    _Ang_.                      How foretold you?

    _Doge_. Long years ago--so long, they are a doubt[466]
    In memory, and yet they live in annals:
    When I was in my youth, and served the Senate
    And Signory as Podesta and Captain
    Of the town of Treviso, on a day
    Of festival, the sluggish Bishop who                                20
    Conveyed the Host aroused my rash young anger,
    By strange delay, and arrogant reply
    To my reproof: I raised my hand and smote him,
    Until he reeled beneath his holy burthen;[fp]
    And as he rose from earth again, he raised
    His tremulous hands in pious wrath towards Heaven.
    Thence pointing to the Host, which had fallen from him,
    He turned to me, and said, "The Hour will come
    When he thou hast o'erthrown shall overthrow thee:
    The Glory shall depart from out thy house,                          30
    The Wisdom shall be shaken from thy soul,
    And in thy best maturity of Mind
    A madness of the heart shall seize upon thee;[fq]
    Passion shall tear thee when all passions cease
    In other men, or mellow into virtues;
    And Majesty which decks all other heads,
    Shall crown to leave thee headless; honours shall
    But prove to thee the heralds of Destruction,
    And hoary hairs of Shame, and both of Death,
    But not such death as fits an aged man."40
    Thus saying, he passed on.--That Hour is come.

    _Ang_. And with this warning couldst thou not have striven
    To avert the fatal moment, and atone,
    By penitence, for that which thou hadst done?

    _Doge_. I own the words went to my heart, so much
    That I remembered them amid the maze
    Of Life, as if they formed a spectral voice,
    Which shook me in a supernatural dream;
    And I repented; but 'twas not for me
    To pull in resolution:[467] what must be                            50
    I could not change, and would not fear.--Nay more,
    Thou can'st not have forgot, what all remember,
    That on my day of landing here as Doge,[468]
    On my return from Rome, a mist of such
    Unwonted density went on before
    The Bucentaur, like the columnar cloud
    Which ushered Israel out of Egypt, till
    The pilot was misled, and disembarked us
    Between the Pillars of Saint Mark's, where 'tis
    The custom of the state to put to death                             60
    Its criminals, instead of touching at
    The Riva della Paglia, as the wont is,--
    So that all Venice shuddered at the omen.

    _Ang_. Ah! little boots it now to recollect
    Such things.

    _Doge_.      And yet I find a comfort in
    The thought, that these things are the work of Fate;
    For I would rather yield to Gods than men,
    Or cling to any creed of destiny,
    Rather than deem these mortals, most of whom[fr]
    I know to be as worthless as the dust,                              70
    And weak as worthless, more than instruments
    Of an o'er-ruling Power; they in themselves
    Were all incapable--they could not be
    Vistors of him who oft had conquered for them.

    _Ang_. Employ the minutes left in aspirations
    Of a more healing nature, and in peace
    Even with these wretches take thy flight to Heaven.

    _Doge_. I _am_ at peace: the peace of certainty
    That a sure Hour will come, when their sons' sons,
    And this proud city, and these azure waters,                        80
    And all which makes them eminent and bright,
    Shall be a desolation and a curse,
    A hissing and a scoff unto the nations,
    A Carthage, and a Tyre, an Ocean Babel.

    _Ang_. Speak not thus now: the surge of Passion still
    Sweeps o'er thee to the last; thou dost deceive
    Thyself, and canst not injure them--be calmer.

    _Doge_. I stand within Eternity, and see
    Into Eternity, and I behold--
    Aye, palpable as I see thy sweet face                               90
    For the last time--the days which I denounce
    Unto all time against these wave-girt walls,
    And they who are indwellers.

    _Guard_ (_coming forward_).   Doge of Venice,
    The Ten are in attendance on your Highness.

    _Doge_. Then farewell, Angiolina!--one embrace--
    Forgive the old man who hath been to thee
    A fond but fatal husband--love my memory--
    I would not ask so much for me still living,
    But thou canst judge of me more kindly now,
    Seeing my evil feelings are at rest.                               100
    Besides, of all the fruit of these long years,
    Glory, and Wealth, and Power, and Fame, and Name,
    Which generally leave some flowers to bloom
    Even o'er the grave, I have nothing left, not even
    A little love, or friendship, or esteem,
    No, not enough to extract an epitaph
    From ostentatious kinsmen; in one hour
    I have uprooted all my former life,
    And outlived everything, except thy heart,
    The pure, the good, the gentle, which will oft                     110
    With unimpaired but not a clamorous grief[fs]
    Still keep----Thou turn'st so pale!--Alas! she faints,
    She has no breath, no pulse!--Guards! lend your aid--
    I cannot leave her thus, and yet 'tis better,
    Since every lifeless moment spares a pang.
    When she shakes off this temporary death,
    I shall be with the Eternal.--Call her women--
    One look!--how cold her hand!--as cold as mine
    Shall be ere she recovers.--Gently tend her,
    And take my last thanks--I am ready now.                           120

                       [_The Attendants of_ ANGIOLINA _enter, and surround
                       their Mistress, who has fainted.--Exeunt the_ DOGE,
                                                      _Guards, etc., etc._


    SCENE III.--_The Court of the Ducal Palace; the outer gates
      are shut against the people.--The_ DOGE _enters in his ducal
      robes, in procession with the_ COUNCIL OF TEN _and other Patricians,
      attended by the Guards, till they arrive at the top of the
      "Giants' Staircase[469] (where the Doges took the oaths); the
      the Executioner is stationed there with his sword.--On arriving, a_
      CHIEF OF THE TEN _takes off the ducal cap from the Doge's head_.

    _Doge_. So now the Doge is nothing, and at last
    I am again Marino Faliero:
    'Tis well to be so, though but for a moment,[ft]
    Here was I crowned, and here, bear witness, Heaven!
    With how much more contentment I resign
    That shining mockery, the ducal bauble,
    Than I received the fatal ornament.

    _One of the Ten_. Thou tremblest, Faliero!

    _Doge_.                                    'Tis with age, then.[470]

    _Ben_. Faliero! hast thou aught further to commend,
    Compatible with justice, to the Senate?                             10

    _Doge_. I would commend my nephew to their mercy,
    My consort to their justice; for methinks
    My death, and such a death, might settle all
    Between the State and me.

    _Ben_.                    They shall be cared for;
    Even notwithstanding thine unheard-of crime.

    _Doge_. Unheard of! aye, there's not a history
    But shows a thousand crowned conspirators
    _Against_ the people; but to set them free,
    One Sovereign only died, and one is dying.

    _Ben_. And who were they who fell in such a cause?                  20

    _Doge_. The King of Sparta, and the Doge of Venice--
    Agis and Faliero!

    _Ben_.           Hast thou more
    To utter or to do?

    _Doge_.            May I speak?

    _Ben_.                         Thou may'st;
    But recollect the people are without,
    Beyond the compass of the human voice.

    _Doge_. I speak to Time and to Eternity,
    Of which I grow a portion, not to man.
    Ye Elements! in which to be resolved
    I hasten, let my voice be as a Spirit
    Upon you! Ye blue waves! which bore my banner.                      30
    Ye winds! which fluttered o'er as if you loved it,
    And filled my swelling sails as they were wafted
    To many a triumph! Thou, my native earth,
    Which I have bled for! and thou, foreign earth,
    Which drank this willing blood from many a wound!
    Ye stones, in which my gore will not sink, but
    Reek up to Heaven! Ye skies, which will receive it!
    Thou Sun! which shinest on these things, and Thou!
    Who kindlest and who quenchest suns!--Attest![fu]
    I am not innocent--but are these guiltless?                         40
    I perish, but not unavenged; far ages
    Float up from the abyss of Time to be,
    And show these eyes, before they close, the doom
    Of this proud City, and I leave my curse
    On her and hers for ever!----Yes, the hours
    Are silently engendering of the day,
    When she, who built 'gainst Attila a bulwark,
    Shall yield, and bloodlessly and basely yield,
    Unto a bastard Attila,[471] without
    Shedding so much blood in her last defence,                         50
    As these old veins, oft drained in shielding her,
    Shall pour in sacrifice.--She shall be bought
    And sold, and be an appanage to those
    Who shall despise her![472]--She shall stoop to be
    A province for an Empire, petty town
    In lieu of Capital, with slaves for senates,
    Beggars for nobles, panders for a people![fv]
    Then when the Hebrew's in thy palaces,[473]
    The Hun in thy high places, and the Greek
    Walks o'er thy mart, and smiles on it for his;                      60
    When thy patricians beg their bitter bread
    In narrow streets, and in their shameful need
    Make their nobility a plea for pity;
    Then, when the few who still retain a wreck
    Of their great fathers' heritage shall fawn
    Round a barbarian Vice of Kings' Vice-gerent,[474]
    Even in the Palace where they swayed as Sovereigns,
    Even in the Palace where they slew their Sovereign,
    Proud of some name they have disgraced, or sprung
    From an adulteress boastful of her guilt                            70
    With some large gondolier or foreign soldier,
    Shall bear about their bastardy in triumph
    To the third spurious generation;--when
    Thy sons are in the lowest scale of being,
    Slaves turned o'er to the vanquished by the victors,
    Despised by cowards for greater cowardice,
    And scorned even by the vicious for such vices
    As in the monstrous grasp of their conception
    Defy all codes to image or to name them;
    Then, when of Cyprus, now thy subject kingdom,                      80
    All thine inheritance shall be her shame
    Entailed on thy less virtuous daughters, grown
    A wider proverb for worse prostitution;--
    When all the ills of conquered states shall cling thee,
    Vice without splendour, Sin without relief[fw][475]
    Even from the gloss of Love to smooth it o'er,
    But in its stead, coarse lusts of habitude,[476]
    Prurient yet passionless, cold studied lewdness,
    Depraving Nature's frailty to an art;--
    When these and more are heavy on thee, when                         90
    Smiles without mirth, and pastimes without Pleasure,
    Youth without Honour, Age without respect,
    Meanness and Weakness, and a sense of woe
    'Gainst which thou wilt not strive, and dar'st not murmur,[477]
    Have made thee last and worst of peopled deserts,
    Then, in the last gasp of thine agony,
    Amidst thy many murders, think of _mine!_
    Thou den of drunkards with the blood of Princes![478]
    Gehenna of the waters! thou Sea-Sodom![fx][479]
    Thus I devote thee to the Infernal Gods!                           100
    Thee and thy serpent seed!
                   [_Here the_ DOGE _turns and addresses the Executioner._
                               Slave, do thine office!
    Strike as I struck the foe! Strike as I would
    Have struck those tyrants! Strike deep as my curse!
    Strike--and but once!

                        [_The_ DOGE _throws himself upon his knees, and as
                       the Executioner raises his sword the scene closes._


          SCENE IV.--_The Piazza and Piazzetta of St. Mark's.--
           The people in crowds gathered round the grated gates
                  of the Ducal Palace, which are shut._

    _First Citizen_. I have gained the Gate, and can discern the Ten,
    Robed in their gowns of state, ranged round the Doge.

    _Second Cit_. I cannot reach thee with mine utmost effort.
    How is it? let us hear at least, since sight
    Is thus prohibited unto the people,
    Except the occupiers of those bars.

    _First Cit_. One has approached the Doge, and now they strip
    The ducal bonnet from his head--and now
    He raises his keen eyes to Heaven; I see
    Them glitter, and his lips move--Hush! hush!--no,                   10
    'Twas but a murmur--Curse upon the distance!
    His words are inarticulate, but the voice
    Swells up like muttered thunder; would we could
    But gather a sole sentence!

    _Second Cit_. Hush! we perhaps may catch the sound.

    _First Cit_.                                        'Tis vain.
    I cannot hear him.--How his hoary hair
    Streams on the wind like foam upon the wave!
    Now--now--he kneels--and now they form a circle
    Round him, and all is hidden--but I see
    The lifted sword in air----Ah! hark! it falls!                      20

                                                     [_The people murmur._

    _Third Cit_. Then they have murdered him who would have freed us.

    _Fourth Cit_. He was a kind man to the commons ever.

    _Fifth Cit_. Wisely they did to keep their portals barred.
    Would we had known the work they were preparing
    Ere we were summoned here--we would have brought
    Weapons, and forced them!

    _Sixth Cit_.              Are you sure he's dead?

    _First Cit_. I saw the sword fall--Lo! what have we here?

       _Enter on the Balcony of the Palace which fronts St. Mark's
          Place a_ CHIEF OF THE TEN,[480] _with a bloody sword.
           He waves it thrice before the People, and exclaims,_

    "Justice hath dealt upon the mighty Traitor!"

                  [_The gates are opened; the populace rush in towards the
                           The foremost of them exclaims to those behind,_

    "The gory head rolls down the Giants' Steps!"[fy][481]
    [_The curtain falls_.[482]

siege of Zara in 1346. According to contemporary documents, he held a
naval command under Civran, who was in charge of the fleet. Byron was
misled by an error in Morelli's Italian version of the _Chronica
iadratina seu historia obsidionis Jaderae_, p. xi. (See _Marino faliero

first half of the sixteenth century. The Venetian chroniclers who were
Faliero's contemporaries, and Anonimo Torriano, a Trevisan, who wrote
before Zuccato, are silent. See _Marino Faliero, La Congiura_, by
Vittorio Lazzarino.--_Nuovo Archivio Veneto_, 1897, vol. xiii. pt. i. p.

[377] {338}While I was in the sub-committee of Drury Lane Theatre, I can
vouch for my colleagues, and I hope for myself, that we did our best to
bring back the legitimate drama. I tried what I could to get _De
Montford_ revived, but in vain, and equally in vain in favour of
Sotheby's _Ivan_, which was thought an acting play; and I endeavoured
also to wake Mr. Coleridge to write us a tragedy[A]. Those who are not
in the secret will hardly believe that the _School for Scandal_ is the
play which has brought the _least money_, averaging the number of times
it has been acted since its production; so Manager Dibdin assured me. Of
what has occurred since Maturin's _Bertram_ I am not aware[B]; so that I
may be traducing, through ignorance, some excellent new writers; if so,
I beg their pardon. I have been absent from England nearly five years,
and, till last year, I never read an English newspaper since my
departure, and am now only aware of theatrical matters through the
medium of the _Parisian Gazette_ of Galignani, and only for the last
twelve months. Let me, then, deprecate all offence to tragic or comic
writers, to whom I wish well, and of whom I know nothing. The long
complaints of the actual state of the drama arise, however, from no
fault of the performers. I can conceive nothing better than Kemble,
Cooke, and Kean, in their very different manners, or than Elliston in
_Gentleman's_ comedy, and in some parts of tragedy. Miss O'Neill[C] I
never saw, having made and kept a determination to see nothing which
should divide or disturb my recollection of Siddons. Siddons and Kemble
were the _ideal_ of tragic action; I never saw anything at all
resembling them, even in _person_; for this reason, we shall never see
again Coriolanus or Macbeth. When Kean is blamed for want of dignity, we
should remember that it is a grace, not an art, and not to be attained
by study. In all, _not_ super-natural parts, he is perfect; even his
very defects belong, or seem to belong, to the parts themselves, and
appear truer to nature. But of Kemble we may say, with reference to his
acting, what the Cardinal de Retz said of the Marquis of Montrose, "that
he was the only man he ever saw who reminded him of the heroes of
Plutarch."[D]

1899, iii. 190; letter to Moore, October 28, 1815, and note 1 (with
quotation from unpublished letter of Coleridge), and passages from
Byron's _Detached Thoughts_ (1821) ... _ibid_., pp. 230, 233-238.]

[B] [Maturin's _Bertram_ was played for the first time at Drury Lane,
May 9, 1816. (See _Detached Thoughts_ (1821), _Letters_, 1899, iii. 233,
and letter to Murray, October 12, 1817, _Letters_, 1900, iv. 171.)]

[C] [Elizabeth O'Neill (1791-1872), afterwards Lady Becher, made her
_debut_ in 1814, and retired from the stage in 1819. Sarah Siddons
(1755-1831) made her final appearance on the stage June 9, 1818, and her
brother John Philip Kemble (1757-1823) appeared for the last time in
_Coriolanus_, June 23, 1817. Of the other actors mentioned in this note,
George Frederick Cooke (1756-1812) had long been dead; Edmund Kean
(1787-1833) had just returned from a successful tour in the United
States; and Robert William Elliston (1774-1831) (_vide ante_, p. 328)
had, not long before (1819), become lessee of Drury Lane Theatre.]

seul homme du monde qui m'ait jamais rappele l'idee de certains heros
que l'on ne voit plus que dans les vies de Plutarque, avail soutenu le
parti du roi d'Angleterre dans son pays, avec une grandeur d'ame qui
rien avait point de pareille en ce siecle."--_Memoires du Cardinal de
Retz_, 1820, ii. 88.]

[378] {339}[This appreciation of the _Mysterious Mother_, which he seems
to have read in Lord Dover's preface to Walpole's Letters to Sir Horace
Mann, provoked Coleridge to an angry remonstrance. "I venture to remark,
first, that I do not believe that Lord Byron spoke sincerely; for I
suspect that he made a tacit exception of himself at least.... Thirdly,
that the _Mysterious Mother_ is the most disgusting, vile, detestable
composition that ever came from the hand of man. No one with a spark of
true manliness, of which Horace Walpole had none, could have written
it."--_Table Talk_, March 20, 1834. Croker took a very different view,
and maintained "that the good old English blank verse, the force of
character expressed in the wretched mother ... argue a strength of
conception, and vigour of expression capable of great things," etc. Over
and above the reasonable hope and expectation that this provocative
eulogy of Walpole's play would annoy the "Cockneys" and the "Lakers,"
Byron was no doubt influenced in its favour by the audacity of the plot,
which not only put _septentrional_ prejudices at defiance, but was an
instance in point that love ought not "to make a tragic subject unless
it is love furious, criminal, and hopeless" (Letter to Murray, January
4, 1821). He would, too, be deeply and genuinely moved by such verse as
this--

    "Consult a holy man! inquire of him!
    --Good father, wherefore? what should I inquire?
    Must I be taught of him that guilt is woe?
    That innocence alone is happiness--
    That martyrdom itself shall leave the villain
    The villain that it found him? Must I learn
    That minutes stamped with crime are past recall?
    That joys are momentary; and remorse
    Eternal?...
    Nor could one risen from the dead proclaim
    This truth in deeper sounds to my conviction;
    We want no preacher to distinguish vice
    From virtue. At our birth the God revealed
    All conscience needs to know. No codicil

[379] {340}[Byron received a copy of Goethe's review of _Manfred_, which
appeared in _Kunst und Alterthum_ (ii. 2. 191) in May, 1820. In a letter
to Murray, dated October 17, 1820 (_Letters_, 1901, v. 100), he enclosed
a letter to Goethe, headed "For _Marino Faliero_. Dedication to Baron
Goethe, etc., etc., etc." It is possible that Murray did not take the
"Dedication" seriously, but regarded it as a _jeu d'esprit_, designed
for the amusement of himself and his "synod." At any rate, the
"Dedication" did not reach Goethe's hand till 1831, when it was
presented to him at Weimar by John Murray the Third. "It is written,"
says Moore, who printed a mutilated version in his _Letters and
Journals, etc._, 1830, ii. 356-358, "in the poet's most whimsical and
mocking mood; and the unmeasured severity poured out in it upon the two
favourite objects of his wrath and ridicule, compels me to deprive the
reader of its most amusing passages." The present text, which follows
the MS., is reprinted from _Letters_, 1901, v. 100-104--

     "Dedication to Baron Goethe, etc., etc., etc.

     "Sir--In the Appendix to an English work lately translated into
     German and published at Leipsic, a judgment of yours upon English
     poetry is quoted as follows: 'That in English poetry, great genius,
     universal power, a feeling of profundity, with sufficient
     tenderness and force, are to be found; but that _altogether these
     do not constitute poets_,' etc., etc.

     "I regret to see a great man falling into a great mistake. This
     opinion of yours only proves that the '_Dictionary of Ten Thousand
     living English Authors_'[A] has not been translated into German.
     You will have read, in your friend Schlegel's version, the dialogue
     in _Macbeth_--

                    "'There are _ten thousand!_
    _Macbeth_. _Geese_, villain?
    _Answer_.                       _Authors_, sir.'[B]

     Now, of these 'ten thousand authors,' there are actually nineteen
     hundred and eighty-seven poets, all alive at this moment, whatever
     their works may be, as their booksellers well know: and amongst
     these there are several who possess a far greater reputation than
     mine, though considerably less than yours. It is owing to this
     neglect on the part of your German translators that you are not
     aware of the works of William Wordsworth, who has a baronet in
     London[C] who draws him frontispieces and leads him about to
     dinners and to the play; and a Lord in the country,[D] who gave him
     a place in the Excise--and a cover at his table. You do not know
     perhaps that this Gentleman is the greatest of all poets
     past--present and to come--besides which he has written an '_Opus
     Magnum_' in prose--during the late election for Westmoreland.[E]
     His principal publication is entitled '_Peter Bell_' which he had
     withheld from the public for '_one and twenty years_'--to the
     irreparable loss of all those who died in the interim, and will
     have no opportunity of reading it before the resurrection. There is
     also another named Southey, who is more than a poet, being actually
     poet Laureate,--a post which corresponds with what we call in Italy
     Poeta Cesareo, and which you call in German--I know not what; but
     as you have a '_Caesar_'--probably you have a name for it. In
     England there is no _Caesar_--only the Poet.

     "I mention these poets by way of sample to enlighten you. They form
     but two bricks of our Babel, (Windsor bricks, by the way) but may
     serve for a specimen of the building.

     "It is, moreover, asserted that 'the predominant character of the
     whole body of the present English poetry is a _disgust_ and
     _contempt_ for life.' But I rather suspect that by one single work
     of _prose_, _you_ yourself have excited a greater contempt for life
     than all the English volumes of poesy that ever were written.
     Madame de Stael says, that 'Werther has occasioned more suicides
     than the most beautiful woman;' and I really believe that he has
     put more individuals out of this world than Napoleon
     himself,--except in the way of his profession. Perhaps, Illustrious
     Sir, the acrimonious judgment passed by a celebrated northern
     journal[F] upon you in particular, and the Germans in general, has
     rather indisposed you towards English poetry as well as criticism.
     But you must not regard our critics, who are at bottom good-natured
     fellows, considering their two professions,--taking up the law in
     court, and laying it down out of it. No one can more lament their
     hasty and unfair judgment, in your particular, than I do; and I so
     expressed myself to your friend Schlegel, in 1816, at Coppet.

     "In behalf of my 'ten thousand' living brethren, and of myself, I
     have thus far taken notice of an opinion expressed with regard to
     'English poetry' in general, and which merited notice, because it
     was yours.

     "My principal object in addressing you was to testify my sincere
     respect and admiration of a man, who, for half a century, has led
     the literature of a great nation, and will go down to posterity as
     the first literary Character of his Age.

     "You have been fortunate, Sir, not only in the writings which have
     illustrated your name, but in the name itself, as being
     sufficiently musical for the articulation of posterity. In this you
     have the advantage of some of your countrymen, whose names would
     perhaps be immortal also--if anybody could pronounce them.

     "It may, perhaps, be supposed, by this apparent tone of levity,
     that I am wanting in intentional respect towards you; but this will
     be a mistake: I am always flippant in prose. Considering you, as I
     really and warmly do, in common with all your own, and with most
     other nations, to be by far the first literary Character which has
     existed in Europe since the death of Voltaire, I felt, and feel,
     desirous to inscribe to you the following work,--_not_ as being
     either a tragedy or a _poem_, (for I cannot pronounce upon its
     pretensions to be either one or the other, or both, or neither,)
     but as a mark of esteem and admiration from a foreigner to the man
     who has been hailed in Germany 'the great Goethe.'

     "I have the honour to be,

     With the truest respect,

     Your most obedient and

     Very humble servant,

     Byron,

     "Ravenna, 8^bre^ 14?, 1820.

     "P.S.--I perceive that in Germany, as well as in Italy, there is a
     great struggle about what they call '_Classical_' and
     '_Romantic_,'--terms which were not subjects of classification in
     England, at least when I left it four or five years ago. Some of
     the English Scribblers, it is true, abused Pope and Swift, but the
     reason was that they themselves did not know how to write either
     prose or verse; but nobody thought them worth making a sect of.
     Perhaps there may be something of the kind sprung up lately, but I
     have not heard much about it, and it would be such bad taste that I
     shall be very sorry to believe it."

Another Dedication, to be prefixed to a Second Edition of the play was
found amongst Byron's papers. It remained in MS. till 1832, when it was
included in a prefatory note to _Marino Faliero, Works of Lord Byron_,
1832, xii. 50.

     "Dedication of _Marino Faliero_.

     "To the Honourable Douglas Kinnaird.

     "My dear Douglas,--I dedicate to you the following tragedy, rather
     on account of your good opinion of it, than from any notion of my
     own that it may be worthy of your acceptance. But if its merits
     were ten times greater than they possibly can be, this offering
     would still be a very inadequate acknowledgment of the active and
     steady friendship with which, for a series of years, you have
     honoured your obliged and affectionate friend,

[382] [The Avogadori, three in number, were the conductors of criminal
prosecutions on the part of the State; and no act of the councils was
valid, unless sanctioned by the presence of one of them; but they were
not, as Byron seems to imply, a court of first instance. The implied
reproach that they preferred to send the case to appeal because Steno
was a member of the "Quarantia," is based on an error of Sanudo's (_vide
ante_, p. 333).]

della Repubblica Veneriana_, _ibid_., xxiii. 1040, gives a coarser
rendering of Steno's Lampoon.--"Becco Marino Fallier dalla belta
mogier;" and there are older versions agreeing in the main with that
Faliero's by Sanudo. It is, however, extremely doubtful whether Faliro's
conspiracy was, in any sense, the outcome of a personal insult. The
story of the Lampoon first appears in the Chronicle of Lorenzo de
Monaci, who wrote in the latter half of the fifteenth century. "Fama
fuit ... quia aliqui adolescentuli nobiles scripserunt in angulis
interioris palatii aliqua verba ignominiosa, et quod ipse (il Doge)
magis incanduit quoniam adolescentuli illi parva fuerant animadversione
puniti." In course of time the "noble youths" became a single noble
youth, whose name occurred in the annals, and the derivation or
evolution of the "verba ignominiosa," followed by a natural
process.--_La Congiura, Nuona Archivio Veneto_, 1897, tom. xiii. pt. ii.
p. 347.]

[384] {349}[Sanudo gives two versions of Steno's punishment: (1) that he
should be imprisoned for two months, and banished from Venice for a
year; (2) that he should be imprisoned for one month, flogged with a
fox's tail, and pay one hundred lire to the Republic.]

[386] {351}[Faliero's appeal to the "law" is a violation of "historical

intervened, when (A.D. 1204) the election to the Empire of
Constantinople lay between the Doge "Arrigo Dandolo" and "Conte
Baldovino di Fiandra."]

[389] {356}[According to the much earlier, and, presumably, more
historical narrative of Lorenzo de Monaci, Bertuccio Isarello was not
chief of the _Arsenalotti_, but simply the patron, that is the owner, of
a vessel (_paron di nave_), and consequently a person of importance
amongst sailors and naval artisans; and the noble who strikes the fatal
blow is not Barbaro, but a certain Giovanni Dandolo, who is known, at
that time, to have been "_sopracomito and consigliere del capitano da
mar_." If the Admiral of the Arsenal had been engaged in the conspiracy,
the fact could hardly have escaped the notice of contemporary
chroniclers. Signor Lazzarino suggests that the name Gisello, or
Girello, which has been substituted for that of Israel Bertuccio, is a
corruption of Isarello.--_La Congiura_, p. 74.]

Brown, 1893, p. 201.)]

[391] An historical fact. See Marin Sanuto's _Lives of the Doges_.

[394] {360}[The famous measure known as the closing of the Great Council
was carried into force during the Dogeship (1289-1311) of Pietro
Gradenigo. On the last day of February, 1297, a law was proposed and
passed, "That the Council of Forty are to ballot, one by one, the names
of all those who during the last four years have had a seat in the Great
Council.... Three electors shall be chosen to submit names of fresh
candidates for the Great Council, on the ... approval of the Doge." But
strict as these provisions were, they did not suffice to restrict the
government to the aristocracy. It was soon decreed "that only those who
could prove that a paternal ancestor had sat on the Great Council, after
its creation in 1176, should now be eligible as members.... It is in
this provision that we find the essence of the _Serrata del Maggior
Consiglio_.... The work was not completed at one stroke.... In 1315 a
list of all those who were eligible ... was compiled. The scrutiny ...
was entrusted to the _Avogadori di Comun_, and became ... more and more
severe. To ensure the purity of blood, they opened a register of
marriages and births.... Thus the aristocracy proceeded to construct
itself more and more upon a purely oligarchical basis."--_Venice, an
Historical Sketch_, by Horatio F. Brown, 1893, pp. 162-164.]

[395] {362}[To "partake" this or that is an obsolete construction, but
rests on the authority of Dryden and other writers of the period.
Byron's "have partook" cannot come under the head of "good, sterling,
genuine English"! (See letter to Murray, October 8, 1820, _Letters_,
1901, v. 89.)]

[396] {363}[The bells of San Marco were never rung but by order of the
Doge. One of the pretexts for ringing this alarm was to have been an
announcement of the appearance of a Genoese fleet off the Lagune.
According to Sanudo, "on the appointed day they [the followers of the
sixteen leaders of the conspiracy] were to make affrays amongst
themselves, here and there, in order that the Duke might have a pretence
for tolling the bells of San Marco." (See, too, _Sketches from Venetian
History, 1831, i. 266, note._)]

_see_ none but in your new publications, and theirs is _no_ language at
all, but jargon.... Gifford says that it is 'good, sterling, genuine
English,' and Foscolo says that the characters are right
Venetian."--Letters to Murray, Sept. 11, Oct. 8, 1820, _Letters_, 1901,
v. 75-89.]

[402] [Byron admits (_vide ante_, p. 340) that the character of the
"Dogaressa" is more or less his own creation. It may be remarked that in
Casimir Delavigne's version of the story, the Duchess (Elena) cherishes
a secret and criminal attachment for Bertuccio Faliero, and that in Mr.
Swinburne's tragedy, while innocent in act, she is smitten with remorse
for a passion which overmasters her loyalty to her husband. Byron's
Angiolina is "faultily faultless, ... splendidly null."

In a letter to Murray, dated January 4, 1821 (_Letters_, 1901, v. 218),
he says, "As I think that _love_ is not the principal passion for
tragedy, you will not find me a popular writer. Unless it is Love,
_furious_, _criminal_, and _hapless_ [as in _The Mysterious Mother_, or
in Alfieri's _Mirra_, or Shelley's _Cenci_], it ought not to make a
tragic subject. When it is melting and maudlin, it _does_, but it ought
not to do; it is then for the gallery and second-price boxes." It is
probable that he owed these sentiments to the theory and practice of
Vittorio Alfieri. "It is extraordinary," writes M. de Fallette Barrol
(_Monthly Magazine_, April, 1805, reprinted in Preface to _Tragedie di
Alfieri_, A. Montucci, Edinburgh, 1805, i. xvi. _sq._), "that a man
whose soul possessed an uncommon share of ardour and sensibility, and
had experienced all the violence of the passions, should scarcely have
condescended to introduce love into his tragedies; or, when he does,
that he should only employ it with a kind of reserve and severity.... He
probably regarded it as a hackneyed agent; for in ... _Myrrha_ it
appears in such a strange character, that all the art of the writer is
not capable of divesting it of an air at once ludicrous and disgusting."

But apart from the example of Alfieri, there was another motive at
work--a determination to prove to the world that he was the master of
his own temperament, and that, if he chose, he could cast away frivolity
and cynicism, and clothe himself with austerity "as with a garment." He
had been taken to task for "treating well-nigh with equal derision the
most pure of virtues, and the most odious of vices" (_Blackwood's Edin.
Mag._, August, 1819), and here was an "answer to his accusers!"]

[403] {368}[The exact date of Marin Falier's birth is a matter of
conjecture, but there is reason to believe that he Was under
seventy-five years of age at the time of the conspiracy. The date

1354, may probably be traced to a document of the fifteenth century, in
which Calendario is described as _commissario_, i.e. executor, of Piero

word or two of what was to take place." Ser Marco Soranzano (p. 466) was

to try the Doge of high treason against the Republic.]

a matter of fact, Beneintendi was at Milan, not at Venice, when the

1797), Buonaparte threatened to "prove an Attila to Venice. If you
cannot," he added, "disarm your population, I will do it in your

[472] Should the dramatic picture seem harsh, let the reader look to the
historical of the period prophesied, or rather of the few years
preceding that period. Voltaire calculated their "nostre bene merite
Meretrici" at 12,000 of regulars, without including volunteers and local
militia, on what authority I know not; but it is, perhaps, the only part
of the population not decreased. Venice once contained two hundred
thousand inhabitants: there are now about ninety thousand; and THESE!!
few individuals can conceive, and none could describe, the actual state
into which the more than infernal tyranny of Austria has plunged this
unhappy city. From the present decay and degeneracy of Venice under the
Barbarians, there are some honourable individual exceptions. There is
Pasqualigo, the last, and, alas! _posthumous_ son of the marriage of the
Doges with the Adriatic, who fought his frigate with far greater
gallantry than any of his French coadjutors in the memorable action off
Lissa. I came home in the squadron with the prizes in 1811, and
recollect to have heard Sir William Hoste, and the other officers
engaged in that glorious conflict, speak in the highest terms of
Pasqualigo's behaviour. There is the Abbate Morelli. There is Alvise
Querini, who, after a long and honourable diplomatic career, finds some
consolation for the wrongs of his country, in the pursuits of literature
with his nephew, Vittor Benzon, the son of the celebrated beauty, the
heroine of "La Biondina in Gondoleta." There are the patrician poet
Morosini, and the poet Lamberti, the author of the "Biondina," etc., and
many other estimable productions; and, not least in an Englishman's
estimation, Madame Michelli, the translator of Shakspeare. There are the
young Dandolo and the improvvisatore Carrer, and Giuseppe Albrizzi, the
accomplished son of an accomplished mother. There is Aglietti, and were
there nothing else, there is the immortality of Canova. Cicognara,
Mustoxithi, Bucati, etc., etc., I do not reckon, because the one is a
Greek, and the others were born at least a hundred miles off, which,
throughout Italy, constitutes, if not a _foreigner_, at least a
_stranger_ (_forestiere_).

Nicolo Pasqualigo (1770-1821) received the command of a ship in the
Austrian Navy in 1800, and in 1805 was appointed Director of the Arsenal
of Venice. He took part in both the Lissa expeditions, and was made
prisoner after a prolonged resistance, March 13, 1811. (See _Personaggi

The Abate Jacopo Morelli (1745-1819), known as _Principe dei
Bibliotecarj_, became custodian of the Marciana Library in 1778, and
devoted the whole of his long and laborious life to the service of
literature. (For a list of his works, etc., see Tipaldo's _Biografia,
etc._, 1835, ii. 481. See, too, _Elogio di Jacopo Morelli_, by A.

Alvisi Querini, brother to Marina Querini Benzon, published in 1759 a
poem entitled _L'Ammiraglio dell' Indie_. He wrote under a pseudonym,
Ormildo Emeressio.

Vittore Benzon (d. 1822), whose mother, Marina, was celebrated by Anton
Maria Lamberti (1757-1832) as _La biondina in gondoleta (Poesie_, 1817,
i. 20), was the author of _Nella_, a love-poem, abounding in political
allusions. (See Tipaldo, v. 122, and _Isabella Teotochi Albrizzi, I Suoi
amici_, by V. Malamani, 1882, pp. 119, 136.)

II Conte Domenico Morosini (see _Letters_, Venezia, 1829) was the author
of two tragedies, _Medea in Corinto_ and _Giulio Sabino_, published in
1806.

Giustina Renier Michiel (1755-1832) was niece to the last Doge, Lodovico
Manin. Her _salon_ was the centre of a brilliant circle of friends,
including such names as Pindemonte, Foscolo, and Cesarotti. Her
translation of _Othello_, _Macbeth_, and _Coriolanus_ formed part of the
_Opere Drammatiche di Shakspeare_, published in Venice in 1797. Her
work, _Origine delle Feste Veneziane_, was published at Milan in 1829.
(See _G. R. Michiel, Archivio Veneto_, tom. xxxviii. 1889.)

Luigi Carrer (1801-1856) began life as a lawyer, but afterwards devoted
himself to poetry and literature. He was secretary of the Venetian
Institute in 1842, and, later, Director of the Carrer Museum. (See Gio.
Crespan, _Della vita e delle lettere di Luigi Carrer_, 1869.)

it is less evident why Byron, doubtless quoting from _Hamlet_, calls
Napoleon the "Vice of Kings." Did he mean a "player-king," one who not
being a king acted the part, as the "vice" in the old moralities; or did
he misunderstand Shakespeare, and seek to depreciate Beauharnais as the
Viceroy of a Viceroy, that is Joseph Bonaparte?]

[477] {459}If the Doge's prophecy seem remarkable, look to the
following, made by Alamanni two hundred and seventy years ago;--"There
is one very singular prophecy concerning Venice: 'If thou dost not
change,' it says to that proud republic, 'thy liberty, which is already
on the wing, will not reckon a century more than the thousandth year.'
If we carry back the epocha of Venetian freedom to the establishment of
the government under which the republic flourished, we shall find that
the date of the election of the first Doge is 697: and if we add one
century to a thousand, that is, eleven hundred years, we shall find the
sense of the prediction to be literally this: 'Thy liberty will not last
till 1797.' Recollect that Venice ceased to be free in the year 1796,
the fifth year of the French republic; and you will perceive that there
never was prediction more pointed, or more exactly followed by the
event. You will, therefore, note as very remarkable the three lines of
Alamanni addressed to Venice; which, however, no one has pointed out:--

    "'Se non cangi pensier, l'un secol solo
      Non contera sopra 'l millesimo anno
      Tua liberta, che va fuggendo a volo.'

prophets for much less."--P. L. Ginguene, _Hist. Lit. d'Italie_, ix. 144

[478] Of the first fifty Doges, _five_ abdicated--_five_ were banished
with their eyes put out--_five_ were massacred--and _nine_ deposed; so
that _nineteen_ out of fifty lost the throne by violence, besides two

Faliero. One of his more immediate predecessors, Andrea Dandolo, died of
vexation. Marino Faliero himself perished as related. Amongst his
successors, _Foscari_, after seeing his son repeatedly tortured and
banished, was deposed, and died of breaking a blood-vessel, on hearing
the bell of Saint Mark's toll for the election of his successor.
Morosini was impeached for the loss of Candia; but this was previous to
his dukedom, during which he conquered the Morea, and was styled the
Peloponnesian. Faliero might truly say,--

                                 NOTE A.


I am obliged for the following excellent translation of the old
Chronicle to Mr. F. Cohen,[483] to whom the reader will find himself
indebted for a version that I could not myself--though after many years'
intercourse with Italian--have given by any means so purely and so
faithfully.


Story of Marino Faliero, Doge XLIV. mcccliv.[483a]


On the eleventh day of September, in the year of our Lord, 1354, Marino
Faliero was elected and chosen to be the Duke of the Commonwealth of
Venice. He was Count of Valdemarino, in the Marches of Treviso, and a
Knight, and a wealthy man to boot. As soon as the election was
completed, it was resolved in the Great Council, that a deputation of
twelve should be despatched to Marino Faliero the Duke, who was then on
his way from Rome; for when he was chosen, he was ambassador at the
court of the Holy Father, at Rome,--the Holy Father himself held his
court at Avignon. When Messer Marino Faliero the Duke was about to land
in this city, on the 5th day of October, 1354, a thick haze came on and
darkened the air: and he was enforced to land on the place of Saint
Mark, between the two columns, on the spot where evil doers are put to
death; and all thought that this was the worst of tokens.--Nor must I
forget to write that which I have read in a chronicle.--When Messer
Marino Faliero was Podesta and Captain of Treviso, the Bishop delayed
coming in with the holy sacrament, on a day when a procession was to
take place. Now, the said Marino Faliero was so very proud and wrathful,
that he buffeted the Bishop, and almost struck him to the ground: and,
therefore, Heaven allowed Marino Faliero to go out of his right senses,
in order that he might bring himself to an evil death.

When this Duke had held the dukedom during nine months and six days, he,
being wicked and ambitious, sought to make himself Lord of Venice, in
the manner which I have read in an ancient chronicle. When the Thursday
arrived upon which they were wont to hunt the bull, the bull hunt took
place as usual; and, according to the usage of those times, after the
bull hunt had ended, they all proceeded unto the palace of the Duke, and
assembled together in one of his halls; and they disported themselves
with the women. And until the first bell tolled they danced, and then a
banquet was served up. My Lord the Duke paid the expenses thereof,
provided he had a Duchess, and after the banquet they all returned to
their homes.

Now to this feast there came a certain Ser Michele Steno, a gentleman of
poor estate and very young, but crafty and daring, and who loved one of
the damsels of the Duchess. Ser Michele stood amongst the women upon the
solajo; and he behaved indiscreetly, so that my Lord the Duke ordered
that he should be kicked off the solajo [i.e. platform]; and the
esquires of the Duke flung him down from the solajo accordingly. Ser
Michele thought that such an affront was beyond all bearing; and when
the feast was over, and all other persons had left the palace, he,
continuing heated with anger, went to the hall of audience, and wrote
certain unseemly words relating to the Duke and the Duchess upon the
chair in which the Duke was used to sit; for in those days the Duke did
not cover his chair with cloth of sendal, but he sat in a chair of wood.
Ser Michele wrote thereon--"_Marin Falier, the husband of the fair wife;
others kiss her, but he keeps her._"[484] In the morning the words were
seen, and the matter was considered to be very scandalous; and the
Senate commanded the Avogadori of the Commonwealth to proceed therein
with the greatest diligence. A largess of great amount was immediately
proffered by the Avogadori, in order to discover who had written these
words. And at length it was known that Michele Steno had written them.
It was resolved in the Council of Forty that he should be arrested; and
he then confessed that in the fit of vexation and spite, occasioned by
his being thrust off the solajo in the presence of his mistress, he had
written the words. Therefore the Council debated thereon. And the
Council took his youth into consideration, and that he was a lover; and
therefore they adjudged that he should be kept in close confinement
during two months, and that afterwards he should be banished from Venice
and the state during one year. In consequence of this merciful sentence
the Duke became exceedingly wroth, it appearing to him, that the Council
had not acted in such a manner as was required by the respect due to his
ducal dignity; and he said that they ought to have condemned Ser Michele
to be hanged by the neck, or at least to be banished for life.

Now it was fated that my Lord Duke Marino was to have his head cut off.
And as it is necessary when any effect is to be brought about, that the
cause of such effect must happen, it therefore came to pass, that on the
very day after sentence had been pronounced on Ser Michele Steno, being
the first day of Lent, a gentleman of the house of Barbara, a choleric
gentleman, went to the arsenal, and required certain things of the
masters of the galleys. This he did in the presence of the Admiral of
the arsenal, and he, bearing the request, answered, No, it cannot be
done. High words arose between the gentleman and the Admiral, and the
gentleman struck him with his fist just above the eye; and as he
happened to have a ring on his finger, the ring cut the Admiral and drew
blood. The Admiral, all bruised and bloody, ran straight to the Duke to
complain, and with the intent of praying him to inflict some heavy
punishment upon the gentleman of Ca Barbaro.--"What wouldst thou have me
do for thee?" answered the Duke: "think upon the shameful gibe which
hath been written concerning me; and think on the manner in which they
have punished that ribald Michele Steno, who wrote it; and see how the
Council of Forty respect our person."--Upon this the Admiral answered,
"My Lord Duke, if you would wish to make yourself a prince, and to cut
all those cuckoldy gentlemen to pieces, I have the heart, if you do but
help me, to make you prince of all this state; and then you may punish
them all." Hearing this, the Duke said, "How can such a matter be
brought about?"--and so they discoursed thereon.

The Duke called for his nephew, Ser Bertuccio Faliero, who lived with
him in the palace, and they communed about this plot. And without
leaving the place, they sent for Philip Calendaro, a seaman of great
repute, and for Bertuccio Israello, who was exceedingly wily and
cunning. Then taking counsel among themselves, they agreed to call in
some others; and so, for several nights successively, they met with the
Duke at home in his palace. And the following men were called in singly;
to wit:--Niccolo Fagiuolo, Giovanni da Corfu, Stefano Fagiono, Niccolo
dalle Bende, Niccolo Biondo, and Stefano Trivisano.--It was concerted
that sixteen or seventeen leaders should be stationed in various parts
of the city, each being at the head of forty men, armed and prepared;
but the followers were not to know their destination. On the appointed
day they were to make affrays amongst themselves here and there, in
order that the Duke might have a pretence for tolling the bells of San
Marco; these bells are never rung but by the order of the Duke. And at
the sound of the bells, these sixteen or seventeen, with their
followers, were to come to San Marco, through the streets which open
upon the Piazza. And when the noble and leading citizens should come
into the Piazza, to know the cause of the riot, then the conspirators
were to cut them in pieces; and this work being finished, my Lord Marino
Faliero the Duke was to be proclaimed the Lord of Venice. Things having
been thus settled, they agreed to fulfil their intent on Wednesday, the
15th day of April, in the year 1355. So covertly did they plot, that no
one ever dreamt of their machinations.

But the Lord, who hath always helped this most glorious city, and who,
loving its righteousness and holiness, hath never forsaken it, inspired
one Beltramo Bergamasco to be the cause of bringing the plot to light,
in the following manner. This Beltramo, who belonged to Ser Niccolo
Lioni of Santo Stefano, had heard a word or two of what was to take
place; and so, in the above-mentioned month of April, he went to the
house of the aforesaid Ser Niccolo Lioni, and told him all the
particulars of the plot. Ser Niccolo, when he heard all these things,
was struck dead, as it were, with affright. He heard all the
particulars; and Beltramo prayed him to keep it all secret; and if he
told Ser Niccolo, it was in order that Ser Niccolo might stop at home on
the 15th of April, and thus save his life. Beltramo was going, but Ser
Niccolo ordered his servants to lay hands upon him, and lock him up. Ser
Niccolo then went to the house of Messer Giovanni Gradenigo Nasoni, who
afterwards became Duke, and who also lived at Santo Stefano, and told
him all. The matter seemed to him to be of the very greatest importance,
as indeed it was; and they two went to the house of Ser Marco Cornaro,
who lived at San Felice; and, having spoken with him, they all three
then determined to go back to the house of Ser Niccolo Lioni, to examine
the said Beltramo; and having questioned him, and heard all that he had
to say, they left him in confinement. And then they all three went into
the sacristy of San Salvatore, and sent their men to summon the
Councillors, the Avogadori, the Capi de' Dieci, and those of the Great
Council.

When all were assembled, the whole story was told to them. They were
struck dead, as it were, with affright. They determined to send for
Beltramo. He was brought in before them. They examined him, and
ascertained that the matter was true; and, although they were
exceedingly troubled, yet they determined upon their measures. And they
sent for the Capi de' Quarante, the Signori di Notte, the Capi de'
Sestieri, and the Cinque della Pace; and they were ordered to associate
to their men other good men and true, who were to proceed to the houses
of the ringleaders of the conspiracy, and secure them. And they secured
the foreman of the arsenal, in order that the conspirators might not do
mischief. Towards nightfall they assembled in the palace. When they were
assembled in the palace, they caused the gates of the quadrangle of the
palace to be shut. And they sent to the keeper of the Bell-tower, and
forbade the tolling of the bells. All this was carried into effect. The
before-mentioned conspirators were secured, and they were brought to the
palace; and, as the Council of Ten saw that the Duke was in the plot,
they resolved that twenty of the leading men of the state should be
associated to them, for the purpose of consultation and deliberation,
but that they should not be allowed to ballot.

The counsellors were the following:--Ser Giovanni Mocenigo, of the
Sestiero of San Marco; Ser Almoro Veniero da Santa Marina, of the
Sestiero of Castello; Ser Tomaso Viadro, of the Sestiero of Canaregio;
Ser Giovanni Sanudo, of the Sestiero of Santa Croce; Ser Pietro
Trivisano, of the Sestiero of San Paolo; Ser Pantalione Barbo il Grando,
of the Sestiero of Ossoduro. The Avogadori of the Commonwealth were
Zufredo Morosini, and Ser Orio Pasqualigo; and these did not ballot.
Those of the Council of Ten were Ser Giovanni Marcello, Ser Tomaso
Sanudo, and Ser Micheletto Dolfino, the heads of the aforesaid Council
of Ten. Ser Luca da Legge, and Ser Pietro da Mosto, inquisitors of the
aforesaid Council. And Ser Marco Polani, Ser Marino Veniero, Ser Lando
Lombardo, and Ser Nicoletto Trivisano, of Sant' Angelo.

Late in the night, just before the dawning, they chose a junta of
twenty noblemen of Venice from amongst the wisest, and the worthiest,
and the oldest. They were to give counsel, but not to ballot. And they
would not admit any one of Ca Faliero. And Niccolo Faliero, and another
Niccolo Faliero, of San Tomaso, were expelled from the Council, because
they belonged to the family of the Doge. And this resolution of creating
the junta of twenty was much praised throughout the state. The following
were the members of the junta of twenty:--Ser Marco Giustiniani,
Procuratore, Ser Andrea Erizzo, Procuratore, Ser Lionardo Giustiniani,
Procuratore, Ser Andrea Contarini, Ser Simone Dandolo, Ser Niccolo
Volpe, Ser Giovanni Loredano, Ser Marco Diedo, Ser Giovanni Gradenigo,
Ser Andrea Cornaro Cavaliere, Ser Marco Soranzo, Ser Rinieri du Mosto,
Ser Gazano Marcello, Ser Marino Morosini, Ser Stefano Belegno, Ser
Niccolo Lioni, Ser Filippo Orio, Ser Marco Trivisano, Ser Jacopo
Bragadino, Ser Giovanni Foscarini.

These twenty were accordingly called in to the Council of Ten; and they
sent for my Lord Marino Faliero, the Duke: and my Lord Marino was then
consorting in the palace with people of great estate, gentlemen, and
other good men, none of whom knew yet how the fact stood.

At the same time Bertuccio Israello, who, as one of the ringleaders, was
to head the conspirators in Santa Croce, was arrested and bound, and
brought before the Council. Zanello del Brin, Nicoletto di Rosa,
Nicoletto Alberto, and the Guardiaga, were also taken, together with
several seamen, and people of various ranks. These were examined, and
the truth of the plot was ascertained.

On the 16th of April judgment was given in the Council of Ten, that
Filippo Calendaro and Bertuccio Israello should be hanged upon the red
pillars of the balcony of the palace, from which the Duke is wont to
look at the bull hunt: and they were hanged with gags in their mouths.

The next day the following were condemned:--Niccolo Zuccuolo, Nicoletto
Blondo, Nicoletto Doro, Marco Giuda, Jacomello Dagolino, Nicoletto
Fidele, the son of Filippo Calendaro, Marco Torello, called Israello,
Stefano Trivisano, the money-changer of Santa Margherita, and Antonio
dalle Bende. These were all taken at Chiozza, for they were endeavouring
to escape. Afterwards, by virtue of the sentence which was passed upon
them in the Council of Ten, they were hanged on successive days; some
singly and some in couples, upon the columns of the palace, beginning
from the red columns, and so going onwards towards the canal. And other
prisoners were discharged, because, although they had been involved in
the conspiracy, yet they had not assisted in it; for they were given to
understand by some of the heads of the plot, that they were to come
armed and prepared for the service of the state, and in order to secure
certain criminals; and they knew nothing else. Nicoletto Alberto, the
Guardiaga, and Bartolommeo Ciricolo and his son, and several others, who
were not guilty, were discharged.

On Friday, the 16th day of April, judgment was also given in the
aforesaid Council of Ten, that my Lord Marino Faliero, the Duke, should
have his head cut off; and that the execution should be done on the
landing-place of the stone staircase, where the Dukes take their oath
when they first enter the palace. On the following day, the 17th of
April, the doors of the palace being shut, the Duke had his head cut
off, about the hour of noon. And the cap of estate was taken from the
Duke's head before he came down stairs. When the execution was over, it
is said that one of the Council of Ten went to the columns of the palace
over against the place of St. Mark, and that he showed the bloody sword
unto the people, crying out with a loud voice--"The terrible doom hath
fallen upon the traitor!"--and the doors were opened, and the people all
rushed in, to see the corpse of the Duke, who had been beheaded.

It must be known that Ser Giovanni Sanudo, the councillor, was not
present when the aforesaid sentence was pronounced; because he was
unwell and remained at home. So that only fourteen balloted; that is to
say, five councillors, and nine of the Council of Ten. And it was
adjudged, that all the lands and chattels of the Duke, as well as of the
other traitors, should be forfeited to the state. And as a grace to the
Duke, it was resolved in the Council of Ten, that he should be allowed
to dispose of two thousand ducats out of his own property. And it was
resolved, that all the councillors and all the Avogadori of the
Commonwealth, those of the Council of Ten, and the members of the junta,
who had assisted in passing sentence on the Duke and the other traitors,
should have the privilege of carrying arms both by day and by night in
Venice, and from Grado to Cavazere. And they were also to be allowed two
footmen carrying arms, the aforesaid footmen living and boarding with
them in their own houses. And he who did not keep two footmen might
transfer the privilege to his sons or his brothers; but only to two.
Permission of carrying arms was also granted to the four Notaries of the
Chancery, that is to say, of the Supreme Court, who took the
depositions; and they were, Amedio, Nicoletto di Lorino, Steffanello,
and Pietro de Compostelli, the secretaries of the Signori di Notte.

After the traitors had been hanged, and the Duke had had his head cut
off, the state remained in great tranquillity and peace. And, as I have
read in a Chronicle, the corpse of the Duke was removed in a barge, with
eight torches, to his tomb in the church of San Giovanni e Paolo, where
it was buried. The tomb is now in that aisle in the middle of the little
church of Santa Maria della Pace which was built by Bishop Gabriel of
Bergamo. It is a coffin of stone, with these words engraven thereon:
"_Heic jacet Dominus Marinus Faletro Dux._"--And they did not paint his
portrait in the hall of the Great Council:--but in the place where it
ought to have been, you see these words:--"_Hic est locus Marini
Faletro, decapitati pro criminibus._"--And it is thought that his house
was granted to the church of Sant' Apostolo; it was that great one near
the bridge. Yet this could not be the case, or else the family bought it
back from the church; for it still belongs to Ca Faliero. I must not
refrain from noting, that some wished to write the following words in
the place where his portrait ought to have been, as
aforesaid:--"_Marinus Faletro Dux, temeritas me cepit. Paenas lui,
decapitatus pro criminibus._"--Others, also, indited a couplet, worthy
of being inscribed upon his tomb.

           _Sceptra, decus, censum perdidit, atque caput._"

NOTE B.

Petrarch on the Conspiracy of Marino Faliero.[485]

"Al giovane doge Andrea Dandolo succedette un vecchio, il quale tardi si
pose al timone della repubblica, ma sempre prima di quel, che facea d'
uopo a lui ed alia patria: egli e Marino Faliero, personaggio a me noto
per antica dimestichezza. Falsa era l' opinione intorno a lui, giacche
egli si mostro fornito piu di coraggio, che di senno. Non pago della
prima dignita, entro con sinistro piede nel pubblico Palazzo:
imperciocche questo doge dei Veneti, magistrato sacro in tutti i secoli,
che dagli antichi fu sempre venerato qual nume in quella citta, l'
altr'jeri fu decollato nel vestibolo dell' istesso Palazzo. Discorrerei
fin dal principio le cause di un tale evento, se cosi vario, ed ambiguo
non ne fosse il grido: nessuno pero lo scusa, tutti affermano, che egli
abbia voluto cangiar qualche cosa nell' ordine della repubblica a lui
tramandato dai maggiori. Che desiderava egli di piu? Io son d' avviso,
che egli abbia ottenuto cio, che non si concedette a nessun altro:
mentre adempiva gli uffici di legato presso il Pontefice, e sulle rive
del Rodano trattava la pace, che io prima di lui avevo indarno tentato
di conchiudere, gli fu conferito l' onore del ducato, che ne chiedeva,
ne s' aspettava. Tornato in patria, penso a quello, cui nessuno non pose
mente giammai, e soffri quello, che a niuno accadde mai di soffrire:
giacche in quel luogo celeberrimo, e chiarissimo, e bellissimo infra
tutti quelli, che io vidi, ove i suoi antenati avevano ricevuti
grandissimi onori in mezzo alle pompe trionfali, ivi egli fu trascinato
in modo servile, e spogliato delle insegne ducali, perdette la testa, e
macchio col proprio sangue le soglie del tempio, l' atrio del Palazzo, e
le scale marmoree endute spesse volte illustri o dalle solenni
festivita, o dalle ostili spoglie. Ho notato il luogo, ora noto il
tempo: e l' anno del Natale di Cristo, 1355, fu il giorno diciotto
aprile si alto e il grido sparso, che se alcuno esaminera la disciplina,
e le costumanze di quella citta, e quanto mutamento di cose venga
minacciato dalla morte di un solo uomo (quantunque molti altri, come
narrano, essendo complici, o subirono l' istesso supplicio, o lo
aspettano) si accorgera, che nulla di piu grande avvenne ai nostri tempi
nella Italia. Tu forse qui attendi il mio giudizio: assolvo il popolo,
se credere si dee alia fama, benche abbia potuto e castigate piu
mitemente, e con maggior dolcezza vendicare il suo dolore: ma non cosi
facilmente, si modera un' ira giusta insieme, e grande in un numeroso
popolo principalmente, nel quale il precipitoso, ed instabile volgo
aguzza gli stimoli dell' iracondia con rapidi, e sconsigliati clamori.
Compatisco, e nell' istesso tempo mi adiro con quell' infelice uomo, il
quale adorno di un' insolito onore, non so, che cosa si volesse negli
estremi anni della sua vita: la calamita di lui diviene sempre piu
grave, perche dalla sentenza contra di esso promulgata apparira, che
egli fu non solo misero, ma insano, e demente, e che con vane arti si
usurpo per tanti anni una falsa fama di sapienza. Ammonisco i dogi, i
quali gli succederanno, che questo e un' esempio posto innanzi ai loro
occhi, quale specchio, nel quale veggano d' essere non signori, ma duci,
anzi nemmeno duci, ma onorati servi della Repubblica. Tu sta sano; e
giacche fluttuano le pubbliche cose, sforziamoci di governar
modestissimamente i privati nostri affari."--_Viaggi di Francesco
Petrarca_, descritti dal Professore Ambrogio Levati, Milano, 1820, iv.
323-325.

The above Italian translation from the Latin epistles of Petrarch
proves--1stly, That Marino Faliero was a personal friend of Petrarch's;
"antica dimestichezza," old intimacy, is the phrase of the poet. 2dly,
That Petrarch thought that he had more courage than conduct, "piu di
_coraggio_ che di senno." 3dly, That there was some jealousy on the part
of Petrarch; for he says that Marino Faliero was treating of the peace
which he himself had "vainly attempted to conclude." 4thly, That the
honour of the Dukedom was conferred upon him, which he neither sought
nor expected, "che ne chiedeva, ne aspettava," and which had never been
granted to any other in like circumstances, "cio che non si concedette a
nessun altro," a proof of the high esteem in which he must have been
held. 5thly, That he had a reputation for _wisdom_, _only_ forfeited by
the last enterprise of his life, "si usurpo per tanti anni una falsa
fama di sapienza."--"He had usurped for so many years a false fame of
wisdom," rather a difficult task, I should think. People are generally
found out before eighty years of age, at least in a republic.--From
these, and the other historical notes which I have collected, it may be
inferred, that Marino Faliero possessed many of the qualities, but not
the success of a hero; and that his passions were too violent. The
paltry and ignorant account of Dr. Moore falls to the ground. Petrarch
says, "that there had been no greater event in his times" (_our times_
literally), "nostri tempi," in Italy. He also differs from the historian
in saying that Faliero was "on the banks of the _Rhone_," instead of at
Rome, when elected; the other accounts say, that the deputation of the
Venetian senate met him at Ravenna. How this may have been, it is not
for me to decide, and is of no great importance. Had the man succeeded,
he would have changed the face of Venice, and perhaps of Italy. As it
is, what _are_ they both?



                                 NOTE C.

Venetian Society and Manners.

    "Vice without splendour, sin without relief
    Even from the gloss of love to smooth it o'er;
    But in its stead, coarse lusts of habitude," etc.

"To these attacks so frequently pointed by the government against the
clergy,--to the continual struggles between the different constituted
bodies,--to these enterprises carried on by the mass of the nobles
against the depositaries of power,--to all those projects of innovation,
which always ended by a stroke of state policy; we must add a cause not
less fitted to spread contempt for ancient doctrines; _this was the
excess of corruption_.

"That freedom of manners, which had been long boasted of as the
principal charm of Venetian society, had degenerated into scandalous
licentiousness: the tie of marriage was less sacred in that Catholic
country, than among those nations where the laws and religion admit of
its being dissolved. Because they could not break the contract, they
feigned that it had not existed; and the ground of nullity, immodestly
alleged by the married pair, was admitted with equal facility by priests
and magistrates, alike corrupt. These divorces, veiled under another
name, became so frequent, that the most important act of civil society
was discovered to be amenable to a tribunal of exceptions; and to
restrain the open scandal of such proceedings became the office of the
police. In 1782 the Council of Ten decreed, that every woman who should
sue for a dissolution of her marriage should be compelled to await the
decision of the judges in some convent, to be named by the court.[486]
Soon afterwards the same council summoned all causes of that nature
before itself.[487] This infringement on ecclesiastical jurisdiction
having occasioned some remonstrance from Rome, the council retained only
the right of rejecting the petition of the married persons, and
consented to refer such causes to the holy office as it should not
previously have rejected.[488]

"There was a moment in which, doubtless, the destruction of private
fortunes, the ruin of youth, the domestic discord occasioned by these
abuses, determined the government to depart from its established maxims
concerning the freedom of manners allowed the subject. All the
courtesans were banished from Venice; but their absence was not enough
to reclaim and bring back good morals to a whole people brought up in
the most scandalous licentiousness. Depravity reached the very bosoms of
private families, and even into the cloister; and they found themselves
obliged to recall, and even to indemnify,[489] women who sometimes
gained possession of important secrets, and who might be usefully
employed in the ruin of men whose fortunes might have rendered them
dangerous. Since that time licentiousness has gone on increasing; and we
have seen mothers, not only selling the innocence of their daughters,
but selling it by a contract, authenticated by the signature of a public
officer, and the performance of which was secured by the protection of
the laws.[490]

"The parlours of the convents of noble ladies, and the houses of the
courtesans, though the police carefully kept up a number of spies about
them, were the only assemblies for society in Venice; and in these two
places, so different from each other, there was equal freedom. Music,
collations, gallantry, were not more forbidden in the parlours than at
the casinos. There were a number of casinos for the purpose of public
assemblies, where gaming was the principal pursuit of the company. It
was a strange sight to see persons of either sex masked, or grave in
their magisterial robes, round a table, invoking chance, and giving way
at one instant to the agonies of despair, at the next to the illusions
of hope, and that without uttering a single word.

"The rich had private casinos, but they lived _incognito_ in them; and
the wives whom they abandoned found compensation in the liberty they
enjoyed. The corruption of morals had deprived them of their empire. We
have just reviewed the whole history of Venice, and we have not once
seen them exercise the slightest influence."--Daru, _Hist. de la Repub.
de Venise_, Paris, 1821, v. 328-332.

       *       *       *       *       *

The author of "Sketches Descriptive of Italy," (1820), etc., one of the
hundred tours lately published, is extremely anxious to disclaim a
possible plagiarism from _Childe Harold_ and _Beppo_. See p. 159, vol.
iv. He adds that still less could this presumed coincidence arise from
"my conversation," as he had "_repeatedly declined an introduction to me
while in Italy_."

Who this person may be I know not;[491] but he must have been deceived
by all or any of those who "repeatedly offered to introduce" him, as I
invariably refused to receive any English with whom I was not previously
acquainted, even when they had letters from England. If the whole
assertion is not an invention, I request this person not to sit down
with the notion that he could have been introduced, since there has been
nothing I have so carefully avoided as any kind of intercourse with his
countrymen,--excepting the very few who were for a considerable time
resident in Venice, or had been of my previous acquaintance. Whoever
made him any such offer was possessed of impudence equal to that of
making such an assertion without having had it. The fact is, that I hold
in utter abhorrence any contact with the travelling English, as my
friend the Consul General Hoppner and the Countess Benzoni (in whose
house the Conversazione mostly frequented by them is held), could amply
testify, were it worth while. I was persecuted by these tourists even to
my riding ground at Lido, and reduced to the most disagreeable circuits
to avoid them. At Madame Benzoni's I repeatedly refused to be introduced
to them;--of a thousand such presentations pressed upon me, I accepted
two, and both were to Irish women.

       *       *       *       *       *

I should hardly have descended to speak of such trifles publicly, if the
impudence of this "sketcher" had not forced me to a refutation of a
disingenuous and gratuitously impertinent assertion; so meant to be, for
what could it import to the reader to be told that the author "had
repeatedly declined an introduction," even if it had been true, which,
for the reasons I have above given, is scarcely possible. Except Lords
Lansdowne, Jersey, and Lauderdale, Messrs. Scott, Hammond, Sir Humphry
Davy, the late M. Lewis, W. Bankes, Mr. Hoppner, Thomas Moore, Lord
Kinnaird, his brother, Mr. Joy, and Mr. Hobhouse, I do not recollect to
have exchanged a word with another Englishman since I left their
Country; and almost all these I had known before. The others,--and God
knows there were some hundreds, who bored me with letters or visits, I
refused to have any communication with, and shall be proud and happy
when that wish becomes mutual.

                INTRODUCTION TO _THE VISION OF JUDGMENT_.


Byron's _Vision of Judgment_ is a parody of Southey's _Vision of
Judgement_.

The acts or fyttes of the quarrel between Byron and Southey occur in the
following order. In the summer of 1817 Southey, accompanied by his
friends, Humphrey Senhouse and the artist Edward Nash, passed some weeks
(July) in Switzerland. They visited Chamouni, and at Montanvert, in the
travellers' album, they found, in Shelley's handwriting, a Greek
hexameter verse, in which he affirmed that he was an "atheist," together
with an indignant comment ("fool!" also in Greek) superadded in an
unknown hand (see _Life of Shelley_, by E. Dowden, 1886, ii. 30, note).
Southey copied this entry into his note-book, and "spoke of the
circumstance on his return" (circ. August 12, 1817). In the course of
the next year some one told Byron that a rumour had reached England that
he and Shelley "had formed a league of incest with two sisters," and
that Southey and Coleridge were the authors of the scandal. There is
nothing to show through what channel the report of the rumour reached
Byron's ears, but it may be inferred that it was in his mind (see Letter
to Murray, November 24, 1818, _Letters_, 1900, iv. 272) when he assailed
Southey in the "Dedication" ("in good, simple, savage verse") to the
First Canto of _Don Juan_, which was begun September 6, 1818. Shelley,
who was already embittered against Southey (see the account of a dinner
at Godwin's, November 6, 1817, _Diary of H. C. Robinson_, 1869, ii. 67),
heard Byron read this "Dedication," and, in a letter to Peacock (October
8, 1818), describes it as being "more like a mixture of wormwood and
verdigrease than satire."

When _Don Juan_ appeared (July 15, 1819), the "Dedication" was not
forthcoming, but of its existence and character Southey had been
informed. "Have you heard," he asks (Letter to the Rev. H. Hill,
_Selections from the Letters, etc._, 1856, iii. 142), "that _Don Juan_
came over with a Dedication to me, in which Lord Castlereagh and I ...
were coupled together for abuse as the 'two Roberts'? A fear of
persecution (_sic_) from the _one_ Robert is supposed to be the reason
why it has been suppressed. Lord Byron might have done well to remember
that the other can write dedications also; and make his own cause good,
if it were needful, in prose or rhyme, against a villain, as well as
against a slanderer."

When George III. died (January 29, 1820), it became the duty of the
"laurel-honouring laureate" to write a funeral ode, and in composing a
Preface, in vindication of the English hexameter, he took occasion
"incidentally to repay some of his obligations to Lord Byron by a few
comments on _Don Juan_" (Letter to the Rev. H. Hill, January 8, 1821,
_Selections, etc._, iii. 225). He was, no doubt, impelled by other and
higher motives to constitute himself a _censor morum_, and take up his
parable against the spirit of the age as displayed and fostered in _Don
Juan_ (see a letter to Wynne, March 23, 1821, _Selections, etc._, iii.
238), but the suppressed "Dedication" and certain gibes, which had been
suffered to appear, may be reckoned as the immediate causes of his
anathema.

Southey's _Vision of Judgement_ was published April 11, 1821--an
undivine comedy, in which the apotheosis of George III., the
beatification of the virtuous, and the bale and damnation of such
egregious spirits as Robespierre, Wilkes, and Junius, are "thrown upon
the screen" of the showman or lecturer. Southey said that the "Vision"
ought to be read aloud, and, if the subject could be forgotten and
ignored, the hexameters might not sound amiss, but the subject and its
treatment are impossible and intolerable. The "Vision" would have "made
sport" for Byron in any case, but, in the Preface, Southey went out of
his way to attack and denounce the anonymous author of _Don Juan_.

"What, then," he asks (ed. 1838, x. 204), "should be said of those for
whom the thoughtlessness and inebriety of wanton youth can no longer be
pleaded, but who have written in sober manhood, and with deliberate
purpose?... Men of diseased hearts and depraved imaginations, who,
forming a system of opinions to suit their own unhappy course of
conduct, have rebelled against the holiest ordinances of human society,
and hating that revealed religion which, with all their efforts and
bravadoes, they are unable entirely to disbelieve, labour to make others
as miserable as themselves, by infecting them with a moral virus that
eats into the soul! The school which they have set up may properly be
called the Satanic school; for, though their productions breathe the
spirit of Belial in their lascivious parts, and the spirit of Moloch in
those loathsome images of atrocities and horrors which they delight to
represent, they are more especially characterized by a Satanic pride and
audacious impiety, which still betrays the wretched feeling of
hopelessness wherewith it is allied."

Byron was not slow to take up the challenge. In the "Appendix" to the
_Two Foscari_ (first ed., pp. 325-329), which was written at Ravenna,
June-July, but not published till December 11, 1821, he retaliates on
"Mr. Southey and his 'pious preface'" in many words; but when it comes
to the point, ignores the charge of having "published a lascivious
book," and endeavours by counter-charges to divert the odium and to
cover his adversary with shame and confusion. "Mr. S.," he says, "with a
cowardly ferocity, exults over the anticipated 'death-bed repentance' of
the objects of his dislike; and indulges himself in a pleasant 'Vision
of Judgment,' in prose as well as verse, full of impious impudence.... I
am not ignorant," he adds, "of Mr. Southey's calumnies on a different
occasion, knowing them to be such, which he scattered abroad on his
return from Switzerland against me and others.... What _his_ 'death-bed'
may be it is not my province to predicate; let him settle it with his
Maker, as I must do with mine. There is something at once ludicrous and
blasphemous in this arrogant scribbler of all works sitting down to deal
damnation and destruction upon his fellow-creatures, with Wat Tyler, the
Apotheosis of George the Third, and the Elegy on Martin the regicide,
all shuffled together in his writing-desk."

Southey must have received his copy of the _Two Foscari_ in the last
week of December, 1821, and with the "Appendix" (to say nothing of the
Third Canto of _Don Juan_) before him, he gave tongue, in the pages of
the _Courier_, January 6, 1822. His task was an easy one. He was able to
deny, _in toto_, the charge of uttering calumnies on his return from
Switzerland, and he was pleased to word his denial in a very
disagreeable way. He had come home with a stock of travellers' tales,
but not one of them was about Lord Byron. He had "sought for no staler
subject than St. Ursula." His charges of "impiety," "lewdness,"
"profanation," and "pollution," had not been answered, and were
unanswerable; and as to his being a "scribbler of all work," there were
exceptions--works which he had _not_ scribbled, the _nefanda_ which
disfigured the writings of Lord Byron. "Satanic school" would stick.

So far, the battle went in Southey's favour. "The words of the men of
Judah were fiercer than the words of the men of Israel," and Byron was
reduced to silence. A challenge (sent through Kinnaird, but not
delivered) was but a confession of impotence. There was, however, in
Southey's letter to the _Courier_ just one sentence too many. Before he
concluded he had given "one word of advice to Lord Byron"--"When he
attacks me again, let it be in rhyme. For one who has so little command
of himself, it will be a great advantage that his temper should be
obliged to _keep tune_."

Byron had anticipated this advice, and had already attacked the laureate
in rhyme, scornfully and satirically, but with a gay and genial mockery
which dispensed with "wormwood and verdigrease" or yet bitterer and more
venomous ingredients.

There was a truth in Lamb's jest, that it was Southey's _Vision of
Judgement_ which was worthy of prosecution; that "Lord Byron's poem was
of a most good-natured description--no malevolence" (_Diary of H. C.
Robinson_, 1869, ii. 240). Good-natured or otherwise, it awoke
inextinguishable laughter, and left Byron in possession of the field.

The _Vision of Judgment_, begun May 7 (but probably laid aside till
September 11), was forwarded to Murray October 4, 1821. "By this post,"
he wrote to Moore, October 6, 1821 (_Letters_, 1901, v. 387), "I have
sent my nightmare to balance the incubus of Southey's impudent
anticipation of the Apotheosis of George the Third." A chance perusal of
Southey's letter in the _Courier_ (see Medwin's _Conversations_, 1824,
p. 222, and letters to Douglas Kinnaird, February 6, 25, 1822) quickened
his desire for publication; but in spite of many appeals and suggestions
to Murray, who had sent Byron's "copy" to his printer, the decisive step
of passing the proofs for press was never taken. At length Byron lost
patience, and desired Murray to hand over "the corrected copy of the
proof with the Preface" of the _Vision of Judgment_ to John Hunt (see
letters to Murray, July 3, 6, 1822, _Letters_, 1901, vi. 92, 93).
Finally, a year after the MS. had been sent to England, the _Vision of
Judgment_, by Quevedo Redivivus, appeared in the first number (pp. 1-39)
of the _Liberal_, which was issued October 15, 1822. The Preface, to
Byron's astonishment and annoyance, was not forthcoming (see letter to
Murray, October 22, 1822, _Letters_, 1901, vi. 126, and _Examiner_,
Sunday, November 3, 1822, p. 697), and is not prefixed to the first
issue of the _Vision of Judgment_ in the first number of the _Liberal_.

The _Liberal_ was severely handled by the press (see, for example, the
_Literary Gazette_ for October 19, 26, November 2, 1822; see, too, an
anonymous pamphlet entitled _A Critique on the "Liberal"_ (London,
1822, 8vo, 16 pages), which devotes ten pages to an attack on the
_Vision of Judgment_). The daily press was even more violent. The
_Courier_ for October 26 begins thus: "This _scoundrel-like_ publication
has at length made its appearance."

There was even a threat of prosecution. Byron offered to employ counsel
for Hunt, to come over to England to stand his trial in his stead, and
blamed Murray for not having handed over the corrected proof, in which
some of the more offensive passages had been omitted or mitigated (see
letter to Murray, December 25, 1822, and letter to John Hunt, January 8,
1823, _Letters,_ 1901, vi. 155, 159). It is to be noted that in the list
of _Errata_ affixed to the table of Contents at the end of the first
volume of the _Liberal,_ the words, a "weaker king ne'er," are
substituted for "a worse king never" (stanza viii. line 6), and "an
unhandsome woman" for "a bad, ugly woman" (stanza xii. line 8). It would
seem that these emendations, which do not appear in the MS., were
slipped into the _Errata_ as precautions, not as after-thoughts.

Nevertheless, it was held that a publication "calumniating the late
king, and wounding the feelings of his present Majesty," was a danger to
the public peace, and on January 15, 1824, the case of the King _v._
John Hunt was tried in the Court of King's Bench. The jury brought in a
verdict of "Guilty," but judgment was deferred, and it was not till July
19, 1824, three days after the author of the _Vision of Judgment_ had
been laid to rest at Hucknall Torkard, that the publisher was sentenced
to pay to the king a fine of one hundred pounds, and to enter into
securities, for five years, for a larger amount.

NOTE.

The following excerpt from H. C. Robinson's _Diary_ is printed from the
original MS., with the kind permission of the trustees of Dr. Williams'
Theological Library (see "Diary," 1869, ii. 437):--

     "[Weimar], August 15, [1829].

     "W[ordsworth] will not put the nose of B[yron] out with Frau von
     Goethe, but he will be appreciated by her. I am afraid of the
     experiment with the great poet himself....

     " ... I alone to the poet....

     "I read to him the _Vision of Judgment_. He enjoyed it like a
     child; but his criticisms went little beyond the exclamatory 'Toll!
     Ganz grob! himmlisch! unubertrefflich!' etc., etc.

     "In general, the more strongly peppered passages pleased him the
     best. Stanza 9 he praised for the clear distinct painting; 10 he
     repeated with emphasis,--the last two lines conscious that his own
     age was eighty; 13, 14, and 15 are favourites with me. G. concurred
     in the suggested praise. The stanza 24 he declared to be sublime.
     The characteristic speeches of Wilkes and Junius he thought most
     admirable.

     "Byron 'hat selbst viel ubertroffen;' and the introduction of
     Southey made him laugh heartily.

     "August 16.

     "Lord B. he declared to be inimitable. Ariosto was not so _keck_ as
     Lord B. in the _Vision of Judgment_."




                                 PREFACE

It hath been wisely said, that "One fool makes many;" and it hath been
poetically observed--

    "[That] fools rush in where angels fear to tread."

                                  [POPE'S _Essay on Criticism_, line 625.]

If Mr. Southey had not rushed in where he had no business, and where he
never was before, and never will be again, the following poem would not
have been written. It is not impossible that it may be as good as his
own, seeing that it cannot, by any species of stupidity, natural or
acquired, be _worse._ The gross flattery, the dull impudence, the
renegade intolerance, and impious cant, of the poem by the author of
"Wat Tyler," are something so stupendous as to form the sublime of
himself--containing the quintessence of his own attributes.

So much for his poem--a word on his preface. In this preface it has
pleased the magnanimous Laureate to draw the picture of a supposed
"Satanic School," the which he doth recommend to the notice of the
legislature; thereby adding to his other laurels the ambition of those
of an informer. If there exists anywhere, except in his imagination,
such a School, is he not sufficiently armed against it by his own
intense vanity? The truth is that there are certain writers whom Mr. S.
imagines, like Scrub, to have "talked of _him_; for they laughed
consumedly."[492]

I think I know enough of most of the writers to whom he is supposed to
allude, to assert, that they, in their individual capacities, have done
more good, in the charities of life, to their fellow-creatures, in any
one year, than Mr. Southey has done harm to himself by his absurdities
in his whole life; and this is saying a great deal. But I have a few
questions to ask.

1stly, Is Mr. Southey the author of _Wat Tyler_?

2ndly, Was he not refused a remedy at law by the highest judge of his
beloved England, because it was a blasphemous and seditious
publication?[493]

3rdly, Was he not entitled by William Smith, in full parliament, "a
rancorous renegado?"[494]

4thly, Is he not poet laureate, with his own lines on Martin the
regicide staring him in the face?[495]

And, 5thly, Putting the four preceding items together, with what
conscience dare _he_ call the attention of the laws to the publications
of others, be they what they may?

I say nothing of the cowardice of such a proceeding; its meanness speaks
for itself; but I wish to touch upon the _motive_, which is neither more
nor less than that Mr. S. has been laughed at a little in some recent
publications, as he was of yore in the _Anti-jacobin_, by his present
patrons. Hence all this "skimble scamble stuff" about "Satanic," and so
forth. However, it is worthy of him--"_qualis ab incepto_."

If there is anything obnoxious to the political opinions of a portion of
the public in the following poem, they may thank Mr. Southey. He might
have written hexameters, as he has written everything else, for aught
that the writer cared--had they been upon another subject. But to
attempt to canonise a monarch, who, whatever were his household virtues,
was neither a successful nor a patriot king,--inasmuch as several years
of his reign passed in war with America and Ireland, to say nothing of
the aggression upon France--like all other exaggeration, necessarily
begets opposition. In whatever manner he may be spoken of in this new
_Vision_, his _public_ career will not be more favourably transmitted by
history. Of his private virtues (although a little expensive to the
nation) there can be no doubt.

With regard to the supernatural personages treated of, I can only say
that I know as much about them, and (as an honest man) have a better
right to talk of them than Robert Southey. I have also treated them more
tolerantly. The way in which that poor insane creature, the Laureate,
deals about his judgments in the next world, is like his own judgment in
this. If it was not completely ludicrous, it would be something worse. I
don't think that there is much more to say at present.

                                                        QUEVEDO REDIVIVUS.

P.S.--It is possible that some readers may object, in these
objectionable times, to the freedom with which saints, angels, and
spiritual persons discourse in this _Vision_. But, for precedents upon
such points, I must refer him to Fielding's _Journey from this World to
the next_, and to the Visions of myself, the said Quevedo, in Spanish
or translated.[496] The reader is also requested to observe, that no
doctrinal tenets are insisted upon or discussed; that the person of the
Deity is carefully withheld from sight, which is more than can be said
for the Laureate, who hath thought proper to make him talk, not "like a
school-divine,"[497] but like the unscholarlike Mr. Southey. The whole
action passes on the outside of heaven; and Chaucer's _Wife of Bath_,
Pulci's _Morgante Maggiore_, Swift's _Tale of a Tub_, and the other
works above referred to, are cases in point of the freedom with which
saints, etc., may be permitted to converse in works not intended to be
serious.

                                                                      Q.R.

* * * Mr. Southey being, as he says, a good Christian and vindictive,
threatens, I understand, a reply to this our answer. It is to be hoped
that his visionary faculties will in the meantime have acquired a little
more judgment, properly so called: otherwise he will get himself into
new dilemmas. These apostate jacobins furnish rich rejoinders. Let him
take a specimen. Mr. Southey laudeth grievously "one Mr. Landor,"[498]
who cultivates much private renown in the shape of Latin verses; and
not long ago, the poet laureate dedicated to him, it appeareth, one of
his fugitive lyrics, upon the strength of a poem called "_Gebir_." Who
could suppose, that in this same Gebir the aforesaid Savage Landor (for
such is his grim cognomen) putteth into the infernal regions no less a
person than the hero of his friend Mr. Southey's heaven,--yea, even
George the Third! See also how personal Savage becometh, when he hath a
mind. The following is his portrait of our late gracious sovereign:--

     (Prince Gebir having descended into the infernal regions, the
     shades of his royal ancestors are, at his request, called up to his
     view; and he exclaims to his ghostly  guide)--

    "'Aroar, what wretch that nearest us? what wretch
    Is that with eyebrows white and slanting brow?
    Listen! him yonder who, bound down supine,
    Shrinks yelling from that sword there, engine-hung;
    He too amongst my ancestors! [I hate
    The despot, but the dastard I despise.
    Was he our countryman?'
                            'Alas,][499] O king!
    Iberia bore him, but the breed accurst
    Inclement winds blew blighting from north-east.'
    'He was a warrior then, nor fear'd the gods?'
    'Gebir, he feared the Demons, not the gods,
    Though them indeed his daily face adored;
    And was no warrior, yet the thousand lives
    Squandered, as stones to exercise a sling,
    And the tame cruelty and cold caprice--
      Oh madness of mankind! addressed, adored!'"

                                   _Gebir_ [_Works, etc._, 1876, vii. 17].

I omit noticing some edifying Ithyphallics of Savagius, wishing to keep
the proper veil over them, if his grave but somewhat indiscreet
worshipper will suffer it; but certainly these teachers of "great moral
lessons" are apt to be found in strange company.




                       THE VISION OF JUDGMENT.[500]

                        I.

    Saint Peter sat by the celestial gate:
      His keys were rusty, and the lock was dull,
    So little trouble had been given of late;
      Not that the place by any means was full,
    But since the Gallic era "eighty-eight"
      The Devils had ta'en a longer, stronger pull,
    And "a pull altogether," as they say
    At sea--which drew most souls another way.

                        II.

    The Angels all were singing out of tune,
      And hoarse with having little else to do,
    Excepting to wind up the sun and moon,
      Or curb a runaway young star or two,[fz]
    Or wild colt of a comet, which too soon
      Broke out of bounds o'er the ethereal blue,
    Splitting some planet with its playful tail,
    As boats are sometimes by a wanton whale.

                        III.

    The Guardian Seraphs had retired on high,
      Finding their charges past all care below;[ga]
    Terrestrial business filled nought in the sky
      Save the Recording Angel's black bureau;
    Who found, indeed, the facts to multiply
      With such rapidity of vice and woe,
    That he had stripped off both his wings in quills,
    And yet was in arrear of human ills.

                        IV.

    His business so augmented of late years,
      That he was forced, against his will, no doubt,
    (Just like those cherubs, earthly ministers,)
      For some resource to turn himself about,
    And claim the help of his celestial peers,[gb]
      To aid him ere he should be quite worn out
    By the increased demand for his remarks:[gc]
    Six Angels and twelve Saints were named his clerks.

                        V.

    This was a handsome board--at least for Heaven;
      And yet they had even then enough to do,
    So many Conquerors' cars were daily driven,
      So many kingdoms fitted up anew;
    Each day, too, slew its thousands six or seven,
      Till at the crowning carnage, Waterloo,
    They threw their pens down in divine disgust--
    The page was so besmeared with blood and dust.[gd]

                        VI.

    This by the way; 'tis not mine to record
      What Angels shrink from: even the very Devil
    On this occasion his own work abhorred,
      So surfeited with the infernal revel:
    Though he himself had sharpened every sword,[ge]
      It almost quenched his innate thirst of evil.
    (Here Satan's sole good work deserves insertion--
    'Tis, that he has both Generals in reversion.)[gf][501]

                        VII.

    Let's skip a few short years of hollow peace,
      Which peopled earth no better, Hell as wont,
    And Heaven none--they form the tyrant's lease,
      With nothing but new names subscribed upon't;
    'Twill one day finish: meantime they increase,[gg]
      "With seven heads and ten horns," and all in front,
    Like Saint John's foretold beast; but ours are born
    Less formidable in the head than horn.[gh]

                        VIII.

    In the first year of Freedom's second dawn[502]
      Died George the Third; although no tyrant, one
    Who shielded tyrants, till each sense withdrawn[gi]
      Left him nor mental nor external sun:[503]
    A better farmer ne'er brushed dew from lawn,[gj]
      A worse king never left a realm undone!
    He died--but left his subjects still behind,
    One half as mad--and t'other no less blind.[gk][504]

                        IX.

    He died! his death made no great stir on earth:
      His burial made some pomp; there was profusion
    Of velvet--gilding--brass--and no great dearth
      Of aught but tears--save those shed by collusion:
    For these things may be bought at their true worth;
      Of elegy there was the due infusion--
    Bought also; and the torches, cloaks and banners,
    Heralds, and relics of old Gothic manners,[505]

                        X.

    Formed a sepulchral melodrame. Of all
      The fools who flocked to swell or see the show,
    Who cared about the corpse? The funeral
      Made the attraction, and the black the woe,
    There throbbed not there a thought which pierced the pall;
      And when the gorgeous coffin was laid low,
    It seemed the mockery of hell to fold
    The rottenness of eighty years in gold.[506]


                        XI.

    So mix his body with the dust! It might
      Return to what it _must_ far sooner, were
    The natural compound left alone to fight
      Its way back into earth, and fire, and air;
    But the unnatural balsams merely blight
      What Nature made him at his birth, as bare
    As the mere million's base unmummied clay--
    Yet all his spices but prolong decay.[507]

                        XII.

    He's dead--and upper earth with him has done;
      He's buried; save the undertaker's bill,
    Or lapidary scrawl, the world is gone
      For him, unless he left a German will:[508]
    But where's the proctor who will ask his son?
      In whom his qualities are reigning still,[gl]
    Except that household virtue, most uncommon,
    Of constancy to a bad, ugly woman.

                        XIII.

    "God save the king!" It is a large economy
      In God to save the like; but if he will
    Be saving, all the better; for not one am I
      Of those who think damnation better still:[509]
    I hardly know too if not quite alone am I
      In this small hope of bettering future ill
    By circumscribing, with some slight restriction,
    The eternity of Hell's hot jurisdiction.

                        XIV.

    I know this is unpopular; I know
      'Tis blasphemous; I know one may be damned
    For hoping no one else may e'er be so;
      I know my catechism; I know we're crammed
    With the best doctrines till we quite o'erflow;
      I know that all save England's Church have shammed,
    And that the other twice two hundred churches
    And synagogues have made a _damned_ bad purchase.

                        XV.

    God help us all! God help me too! I am,
      God knows, as helpless as the Devil can wish,
    And not a whit more difficult to damn,
      Than is to bring to land a late-hooked fish,
    Or to the butcher to purvey the lamb;
      Not that I'm fit for such a noble dish,
    As one day will be that immortal fry
    Of almost every body born to die.

                        XVI.

    Saint Peter sat by the celestial gate,
      And nodded o'er his keys: when, lo! there came
    A wondrous noise he had not heard of late--
      A rushing sound of wind, and stream, and flame;
    In short, a roar of things extremely great,
      Which would have made aught save a Saint exclaim;
    But he, with first a start and then a wink,
    Said, "There's another star gone out, I think!"[gm]

                        XVII.

    But ere he could return to his repose,
      A Cherub flapped his right wing o'er his eyes--
    At which Saint Peter yawned, and rubbed his nose:
      "Saint porter," said the angel, "prithee rise!"
    Waving a goodly wing, which glowed, as glows
      An earthly peacock's tail, with heavenly dyes:
    To which the saint replied, "Well, what's the matter?
    "Is Lucifer come back with all this clatter?"

                        XVIII.

    "No," quoth the Cherub: "George the Third is dead."
      "And who _is_ George the Third?" replied the apostle:
    "_What George? what Third?_" "The King of England," said
      The angel. "Well! he won't find kings to jostle
    Him on his way; but does he wear his head?
      Because the last we saw here had a tustle,
    And ne'er would have got into Heaven's good graces,
    Had he not flung his head in all our faces.

                        XIX.

    "He was--if I remember--King of France;[510]
      That head of his, which could not keep a crown
    On earth, yet ventured in my face to advance
      A claim to those of martyrs--like my own:
    If I had had my sword, as I had once
      When I cut ears off, I had cut him down;
    But having but my _keys_, and not my brand,
    I only knocked his head from out his hand.

                        XX.

    "And then he set up such a headless howl,
      That all the Saints came out and took him in;
    And there he sits by Saint Paul, cheek by jowl;[gn]
      That fellow Paul--the parvenu! The skin[511]
    Of Saint Bartholomew, which makes his cowl
      In heaven, and upon earth redeemed his sin,
    So as to make a martyr, never sped
    Better than did this weak and wooden head.

                        XXI.

    "But had it come up here upon its shoulders,
      There would have been a different tale to tell:
    The fellow-feeling in the Saint's beholders
      Seems to have acted on them like a spell;
    And so this very foolish head Heaven solders
      Back on its trunk: it may be very well,
    And seems the custom here to overthrow
    Whatever has been wisely done below."

                        XXII.

    The Angel answered, "Peter! do not pout:
      The King who comes has head and all entire,
    And never knew much what it was about--
      He did as doth the puppet--by its wire,
    And will be judged like all the rest, no doubt:
      My business and your own is not to inquire
    Into such matters, but to mind our cue--
    Which is to act as we are bid to do."

                        XXIII.

    While thus they spake, the angelic caravan,
      Arriving like a rush of mighty wind,
    Cleaving the fields of space, as doth the swan
      Some silver stream (say Ganges, Nile, or Inde,
    Or Thames, or Tweed), and midst them an old man
      With an old soul, and both extremely blind,
    Halted before the gate, and, in his shroud,
    Seated their fellow-traveller on a cloud.[512]

                        XXIV.

    But bringing up the rear of this bright host
      A Spirit of a different aspect waved
    His wings, like thunder-clouds above some coast
      Whose barren beach with frequent wrecks is paved;
    His brow was like the deep when tempest-tossed;
      Fierce and unfathomable thoughts engraved
    Eternal wrath on his immortal face,
    And _where_ he gazed a gloom pervaded space.

                        XXV.

    As he drew near, he gazed upon the gate
      Ne'er to be entered more by him or Sin,
    With such a glance of supernatural hate,
      As made Saint Peter wish himself within;
    He pottered[513] with his keys at a great rate,
      And sweated through his Apostolic skin:[go]
    Of course his perspiration was but ichor,
    Or some such other spiritual liquor.[gp]

                        XXVI.

    The very Cherubs huddled all together,
      Like birds when soars the falcon; and they felt
    A tingling to the tip of every feather,
      And formed a circle like Orion's belt
    Around their poor old charge; who scarce knew whither
      His guards had led him, though they gently dealt
    With royal Manes (for by many stories,
    And true, we learn the Angels all are Tories).

                        XXVII.

    As things were in this posture, the gate flew
      Asunder, and the flashing of its hinges
    Flung over space an universal hue
      Of many-coloured flame, until its tinges
    Reached even our speck of earth, and made a new
      Aurora borealis spread its fringes
    O'er the North Pole; the same seen, when ice-bound,
    By Captain Parry's crew, in "Melville's Sound."[gq][514]

                        XXVIII.

    And from the gate thrown open issued beaming
      A beautiful and mighty Thing of Light,[515]
    Radiant with glory, like a banner streaming
      Victorious from some world-o'erthrowing fight:
    My poor comparisons must needs be teeming
      With earthly likenesses, for here the night
    Of clay obscures our best conceptions, saving
    Johanna Southcote,[516] or Bob Southey raving.[517]

                        XXIX.

    'Twas the Archangel Michael: all men know
      The make of Angels and Archangels, since
    There's scarce a scribbler has not one to show,
      From the fiends' leader to the Angels' Prince.
    There also are some altar-pieces, though
      I really can't say that they much evince
    One's inner notions of immortal spirits;
    But let the connoisseurs explain _their_ merits.

                        XXX.

    Michael flew forth in glory and in good;
      A goodly work of him from whom all Glory
    And Good arise; the portal past--he stood;
      Before him the young Cherubs and Saints hoary--
    (I say _young_, begging to be understood
      By looks, not years; and should be very sorry
    To state, they were not older than St. Peter,
    But merely that they seemed a little sweeter).

                        XXXI.

    The Cherubs and the Saints bowed down before
      That arch-angelic Hierarch, the first
    Of Essences angelical who wore
      The aspect of a god; but this ne'er nursed
    Pride in his heavenly bosom, in whose core
      No thought, save for his Maker's service, durst
    Intrude, however glorified and high;
    He knew him but the Viceroy of the sky.

                        XXXII.

    He and the sombre, silent Spirit met--
      They knew each other both for good and ill;
    Such was their power, that neither could forget
      His former friend and future foe; but still
    There was a high, immortal, proud regret
      In either's eye, as if 'twere less their will
    Than destiny to make the eternal years
    Their date of war, and their "Champ Clos" the spheres.

                        XXXIII.

    But here they were in neutral space: we know
      From Job, that Satan hath the power to pay
    A heavenly visit thrice a-year or so;
      And that the "Sons of God," like those of clay,
    Must keep him company; and we might show
      From the same book, in how polite a way
    The dialogue is held between the Powers
    Of Good and Evil--but 'twould take up hours.

                        XXXIV.

    And this is not a theologic tract,[518]
      To prove with Hebrew and with Arabic,
    If Job be allegory or a fact,
      But a true narrative; and thus I pick
    From out the whole but such and such an act
      As sets aside the slightest thought of trick.
    'Tis every tittle true, beyond suspicion,
    And accurate as any other vision.


                        XXXV.

    The spirits were in neutral space, before
      The gate of Heaven; like eastern thresholds is[519]
    The place where Death's grand cause is argued o'er,
      And souls despatched to that world or to this;
    And therefore Michael and the other wore
      A civil aspect: though they did not kiss,
    Yet still between his Darkness and his Brightness
    There passed a mutual glance of great politeness.

                        XXXVI.

    The Archangel bowed, not like a modern beau,
      But with a graceful oriental bend,
    Pressing one radiant arm just where below[gr]
      The heart in good men is supposed to tend;
    He turned as to an equal, not too low,
      But kindly; Satan met his ancient friend[gs]
    With more hauteur, as might an old Castilian
    Poor Noble meet a mushroom rich civilian.

                        XXXVII.

    He merely bent his diabolic brow
      An instant; and then raising it, he stood
    In act to assert his right or wrong, and show
      Cause why King George by no means could or should
    Make out a case to be exempt from woe
      Eternal, more than other kings, endued
    With better sense and hearts, whom History mentions,
    Who long have "paved Hell with their good intentions."[520]


                        XXXVIII.

    Michael began: "What wouldst thou with this man,
      Now dead, and brought before the Lord? What ill
    Hath he wrought since his mortal race began,
      That thou canst claim him? Speak! and do thy will,
    If it be just: if in this earthly span
      He hath been greatly failing to fulfil
    His duties as a king and mortal, say,
    And he is thine; if not--let him have way."

                        XXXIX.

    "Michael!" replied the Prince of Air, "even here
      Before the gate of Him thou servest, must
    I claim my subject: and will make appear
      That as he was my worshipper in dust,
    So shall he be in spirit, although dear
      To thee and thine, because nor wine nor lust
    Were of his weaknesses; yet on the throne
    He reigned o'er millions to serve me alone.

                        XL.

    "Look to _our_ earth, or rather _mine_; it was,
      _Once, more_ thy master's: but I triumph not
    In this poor planet's conquest; nor, alas!
      Need he thou servest envy me my lot:
    With all the myriads of bright worlds which pass
      In worship round him, he may have forgot
    Yon weak creation of such paltry things:
    I think few worth damnation save their kings,

                        XLI.

    "And these but as a kind of quit-rent, to
      Assert my right as Lord: and even had
    I such an inclination,'twere (as you
      Well know) superfluous; they are grown so bad,
    That Hell has nothing better left to do
      Than leave them to themselves: so much more mad
    And evil by their own internal curse,
    Heaven cannot make them better, nor I worse.

                        XLII.

    "Look to the earth, I said, and say again:
      When this old, blind, mad, helpless, weak, poor worm
    Began in youth's first bloom and flush to reign,
      The world and he both wore a different form,
    And much of earth and all the watery plain
      Of Ocean called him king: through many a storm
    His isles had floated on the abyss of Time;
    For the rough virtues chose them for their clime.[521]

                        XLIII.

    "He came to his sceptre young; he leaves it old:
      Look to the state in which he found his realm,
    And left it; and his annals too behold,
      How to a minion first he gave the helm;[522]
    How grew upon his heart a thirst for gold,
      The beggar's vice, which can but overwhelm
    The meanest hearts; and for the rest, but glance
    Thine eye along America and France.

                        XLIV.

    "'Tis true, he was a tool from first to last
      (I have the workmen safe); but as a tool
    So let him be consumed. From out the past
      Of ages, since mankind have known the rule
    Of monarchs--from the bloody rolls amassed
      Of Sin and Slaughter--from the Caesars' school,
    Take the worst pupil; and produce a reign
    More drenched with gore, more cumbered with the slain.

                        XLV.

    "He ever warred with freedom and the free:
      Nations as men, home subjects, foreign foes,
    So that they uttered the word 'Liberty!'
      Found George the Third their first opponent. Whose
    History was ever stained as his will be
      With national and individual woes?[gt]
    I grant his household abstinence; I grant
    His neutral virtues, which most monarchs want;

                        XLVI.

    "I know he was a constant consort; own
      He was a decent sire, and middling lord.
    All this is much, and most upon a throne;
      As temperance, if at Apicius' board,
    Is more than at an anchorite's supper shown.
      I grant him all the kindest can accord;
    And this was well for him, but not for those
    Millions who found him what Oppression chose.

                        XLVII.

    "The New World shook him off; the Old yet groans
      Beneath what he and his prepared, if not
    Completed: he leaves heirs on many thrones
      To all his vices, without what begot
    Compassion for him--his tame virtues; drones
      Who sleep, or despots who have now forgot
    A lesson which shall be re-taught them, wake
    Upon the thrones of earth; but let them quake!

                        XLVIII.

    "Five millions of the primitive, who hold
      The faith which makes ye great on earth, implored
    A _part_ of that vast _all_ they held of old,--[gu]
      Freedom to worship--not alone your Lord,
    Michael, but you, and you, Saint Peter! Cold
      Must be your souls, if you have not abhorred
    The foe to Catholic participation[523]
    In all the license of a Christian nation.

                        XLIX.

    "True! he allowed them to pray God; but as
      A consequence of prayer, refused the law
    Which would have placed them upon the same base
      With those who did not hold the Saints in awe."
    But here Saint Peter started from his place
      And cried, "You may the prisoner withdraw:
    Ere Heaven shall ope her portals to this Guelph,
    While I am guard, may I be damned myself!

                        L.

    "Sooner will I with Cerberus exchange
      My office (and _his_ is no sinecure)
    Than see this royal Bedlam-bigot range[gv]
      The azure fields of Heaven, of that be sure!"
    "Saint!" replied Satan, "you do well to avenge
      The wrongs he made your satellites endure;
    And if to this exchange you should be given,
    I'll try to coax _our_ Cerberus up to Heaven!"

                        LI.

    Here Michael interposed: "Good Saint! and Devil!
      Pray, not so fast; you both outrun discretion.
    Saint Peter! you were wont to be more civil:
      Satan! excuse this warmth of his expression,
    And condescension to the vulgar's level:[gw]
      Even Saints sometimes forget themselves in session.
    Have you got more to say?"--"No."--"If you please,
    I'll trouble you to call your witnesses."

                        LII.

    Then Satan turned and waved his swarthy hand,
      Which stirred with its electric qualities
    Clouds farther off than we can understand,
      Although we find him sometimes in our skies;
    Infernal thunder shook both sea and land
      In all the planets--and Hell's batteries
    Let off the artillery, which Milton mentions
    As one of Satan's most sublime inventions.[524]

                        LIII.

    This was a signal unto such damned souls
      As have the privilege of their damnation
    Extended far beyond the mere controls
      Of worlds past, present, or to come; no station
    Is theirs particularly in the rolls
      Of Hell assigned; but where their inclination
    Or business carries them in search of game,
    They may range freely--being damned the same.

                        LIV.

    They are proud of this--as very well they may,
      It being a sort of knighthood, or gilt key
    Stuck in their loins;[525] or like to an "entre"[gx]
      Up the back stairs, or such free-masonry.
    I borrow my comparisons from clay,
      Being clay myself. Let not those spirits be
    Offended with such base low likenesses;
    We know their posts are nobler far than these.[gy]

                        LV.

    When the great signal ran from Heaven to Hell--
      About ten million times the distance reckoned
    From our sun to its earth, as we can tell
      How much time it takes up, even to a second,
    For every ray that travels to dispel
      The fogs of London, through which, dimly beaconed,
    The weathercocks are gilt some thrice a year,
    If that the _summer_ is not too severe:[526]

                        LVI.

    I say that I can tell--'twas half a minute;
      I know the solar beams take up more time
    Ere, packed up for their journey, they begin it;[gz]
      But then their Telegraph is less sublime,[527]
    And if they ran a race, they would not win it
      'Gainst Satan's couriers bound for their own clime.
    The sun takes up some years for every ray
    To reach its goal--the Devil not half a day.

                        LVII.

    Upon the verge of space, about the size
      Of half-a-crown, a little speck appeared
    (I've seen a something like it in the skies
      In the AEgean, ere a squall); it neared,
    And, growing bigger, took another guise;
      Like an aerial ship it tacked, and steered,[528]
    Or _was_ steered (I am doubtful of the grammar
    Of the last phrase, which makes the stanza stammer;

                        LVIII.

    But take your choice): and then it grew a cloud;
      And so it was--a cloud of witnesses.
    But such a cloud! No land ere saw a crowd
      Of locusts numerous as the heavens saw these;[ha]
    They shadowed with their myriads Space; their loud
      And varied cries were like those of wild geese,[hb]
    (If nations may be likened to a goose),
    And realised the phrase of "Hell broke loose."[529]

                        LIX.

    Here crashed a sturdy oath of stout John Bull,
      Who damned away his eyes as heretofore:
    There Paddy brogued "By Jasus!"--"What's your wull?"
      The temperate Scot exclaimed: the French ghost swore
    In certain terms I shan't translate in full,
      As the first coachman will; and 'midst the war,[hc]
    The voice of Jonathan was heard to express,
    "_Our_ President is going to war, I guess."

                        LX.

    Besides there were the Spaniard, Dutch, and Dane;
      In short, an universal shoal of shades
    From Otaheite's isle to Salisbury Plain,
      Of all climes and professions, years and trades,
    Ready to swear against the good king's reign,[hd]
      Bitter as clubs in cards are against spades:[530]
    All summoned by this grand "subpoena," to
    Try if kings mayn't be damned like me or you.

                        LXI.

    When Michael saw this host, he first grew pale,
      As Angels can; next, like Italian twilight,
    He turned all colours--as a peacock's tail,
      Or sunset streaming through a Gothic skylight
    In some old abbey, or a trout not stale,
      Or distant lightning on the horizon by night,
    Or a fresh rainbow, or a grand review
    Of thirty regiments in red, green, and blue.

                        LXII.

    Then he addressed himself to Satan: "Why--
      My good old friend, for such I deem you, though
    Our different parties make us fight so shy,
      I ne'er mistake you for a _personal_ foe;
    Our difference _political_, and I
      Trust that, whatever may occur below,
    You know my great respect for you: and this
    Makes me regret whate'er you do amiss--

                        LXIII.

    "Why, my dear Lucifer, would you abuse
      My call for witnesses? I did not mean
    That you should half of Earth and Hell produce;
      'Tis even superfluous, since two honest, clean,
    True testimonies are enough: we lose
      Our Time, nay, our Eternity, between
    The accusation and defence: if we
    Hear both, 'twill stretch our immortality."

                        LXIV.

    Satan replied, "To me the matter is
      Indifferent, in a personal point of view:
    I can have fifty better souls than this
      With far less trouble than we have gone through
    Already; and I merely argued his
      Late Majesty of Britain's case with you
    Upon a point of form: you may dispose
    Of him; I've kings enough below, God knows!"

                        LXV.

    Thus spoke the Demon (late called "multifaced"[531]
      By multo-scribbling Southey). "Then we'll call
    One or two persons of the myriads placed
      Around our congress, and dispense with all
    The rest," quoth Michael: "Who may be so graced
      As to speak first? there's choice enough--who shall
    It be?" Then Satan answered, "There are many;
    But you may choose Jack Wilkes as well as any."

                        LXVI.

    A merry, cock-eyed, curious-looking Sprite[532]
      Upon the instant started from the throng,
    Dressed in a fashion now forgotten quite;
      For all the fashions of the flesh stick long
    By people in the next world; where unite
      All the costumes since Adam's, right or wrong,
    From Eve's fig-leaf down to the petticoat,
    Almost as scanty, of days less remote.[533]

                        LXVII.

    The Spirit looked around upon the crowds
      Assembled, and exclaimed, "My friends of all
    The spheres, we shall catch cold amongst these clouds;
      So let's to business: why this general call?
    If those are freeholders I see in shrouds,
      And 'tis for an election that they bawl,
    Behold a candidate with unturned coat![he]
    Saint Peter, may I count upon your vote?"

                        LXVIII.

    "Sir," replied Michael, "you mistake; these things
      Are of a former life, and what we do
    Above is more august; to judge of kings
      Is the tribunal met: so now you know."
    "Then I presume those gentlemen with wings,"[hf]
      Said Wilkes, "are Cherubs; and that soul below
    Looks much like George the Third, but to my mind
    A good deal older--bless me! is he blind?"

                        LXIX.

    "He is what you behold him, and his doom
      Depends upon his deeds," the Angel said;
    "If you have aught to arraign in him, the tomb
      Gives license to the humblest beggar's head
    To lift itself against the loftiest."--"Some,"
      Said Wilkes, "don't wait to see them laid in lead,
    For such a liberty--and I, for one,
    Have told them what I thought beneath the sun."

                        LXX.

    "_Above_ the sun repeat, then, what thou hast
      To urge against him," said the Archangel. "Why,"
    Replied the spirit, "since old scores are past,
      Must I turn evidence? In faith, not I.
    Besides, I beat him hollow at the last[534],
      With all his Lords and Commons: in the sky
    I don't like ripping up old stories, since
    His conduct was but natural in a prince.

                        LXXI.

    "Foolish, no doubt, and wicked, to oppress
      A poor unlucky devil without a shilling;
    But then I blame the man himself much less
      Than Bute and Grafton[535], and shall be unwilling
    To see him punished here for their excess,
      Since they were both damned long ago, and still in
    Their place below: for me, I have forgiven,
    And vote his _habeas corpus_ into Heaven."

                        LXXII.

    "Wilkes," said the Devil, "I understand all this;
      You turned to half a courtier[536] ere you died,
    And seem to think it would not be amiss
      To grow a whole one on the other side
    Of Charon's ferry; you forget that _his_
      Reign is concluded; whatsoe'er betide,
    He won't be sovereign more: you've lost your labour,
    For at the best he will but be your neighbour.

                        LXXIII.

    "However, I knew what to think of it,
      When I beheld you in your jesting way,
    Flitting and whispering round about the spit
      Where Belial, upon duty for the day[hg],
    With Fox's lard was basting William Pitt,
      His pupil; I knew what to think, I say:
    That fellow even in Hell breeds farther ills;
    I'll have him _gagged_--'twas one of his own Bills[537].

                        LXXIV.

    "Call Junius!" From the crowd a shadow stalked[538].
      And at the name there was a general squeeze,
    So that the very ghosts no longer walked
      In comfort, at their own aerial ease,
    But were all rammed, and jammed (but to be balked,
      As we shall see), and jostled hands and knees,
    Like wind compressed and pent within a bladder,
    Or like a human colic, which is sadder.[hh]

                        LXXV.

    The shadow came--a tall, thin, grey-haired figure,
      That looked as it had been a shade on earth[hi];
    Quick in its motions, with an air of vigour,
      But nought to mark its breeding or its birth;
    Now it waxed little, then again grew bigger[hj],
      With now an air of gloom, or savage mirth:
    But as you gazed upon its features, they
    Changed every instant--to _what_, none could say.

                        LXXVI.

    The more intently the ghosts gazed, the less
      Could they distinguish whose the features were;
    The Devil himself seemed puzzled even to guess;
      They varied like a dream--now here, now there;
    And several people swore from out the press,
      They knew him perfectly; and one could swear
    He was his father; upon which another
    Was sure he was his mother's cousin's brother:

                        LXXVII.

    Another, that he was a duke, or knight,
      An orator, a lawyer, or a priest,
    A nabob, a man-midwife;[539] but the wight[hk]
      Mysterious changed his countenance at least
    As oft as they their minds: though in full sight
      He stood, the puzzle only was increased;
    The man was a phantasmagoria in
    Himself--he was so volatile and thin.

                        LXXVIII.

    The moment that you had pronounced him _one_,
      Presto! his face changed, and he was another;
    And when that change was hardly well put on,
      It varied, till I don't think his own mother
    (If that he had a mother) would her son
      Have known, he shifted so from one to t'other;
    Till guessing from a pleasure grew a task,[hl]
    At this epistolary "Iron Mask."[540]

                        LXXIX.

    For sometimes he like Cerberus would seem--
      "Three gentlemen at once"[541] (as sagely says
    Good Mrs. Malaprop); then you might deem
      That he was not even _one_; now many rays
    Were flashing round him; and now a thick steam
      Hid him from sight--like fogs on London days:
    Now Burke, now Tooke, he grew to people's fancies
    And certes often like Sir Philip Francis.

                        LXXX.

    I've an hypothesis--'tis quite my own;
      I never let it out till now, for fear
    Of doing people harm about the throne,
      And injuring some minister or peer,
    On whom the stigma might perhaps be blown;
      It is--my gentle public, lend thine ear!
    'Tis, that what Junius we are wont to call,[hm]
    Was _really--truly_--nobody at all.


                        LXXXI.

    I don't see wherefore letters should not be
      Written without hands, since we daily view
    Them written without heads; and books, we see,
      Are filled as well without the latter too:
    And really till we fix on somebody
      For certain sure to claim them as his due,
    Their author, like the Niger's mouth,[542] will bother
    The world to say if _there_ be mouth or author.

                        LXXXII.

    "And who and what art thou?" the Archangel said.
      "For _that_ you may consult my title-page,"[543]
    Replied this mighty shadow of a shade:
      "If I have kept my secret half an age,
    I scarce shall tell it now."--"Canst thou upbraid,"
      Continued Michael, "George Rex, or allege
    Aught further?" Junius answered, "You had better
    First ask him for _his_ answer to my letter:

                        LXXXIII.

    "My charges upon record will outlast[hn]
      The brass of both his epitaph and tomb."
    "Repent'st thou not," said Michael, "of some past
      Exaggeration? something which may doom
    Thyself if false, as him if true? Thou wast
      Too bitter--is it not so?--in thy gloom
    Of passion?"--"Passion!" cried the phantom dim,
    "I loved my country, and I hated him.


                        LXXXIV.

    "What I have written, I have written: let
      The rest be on his head or mine!" So spoke
    Old "_Nominis Umbra_;" and while speaking yet,
      Away he melted in celestial smoke.
    Then Satan said to Michael, "Don't forget
      To call George Washington, and John Horne Tooke,
    And Franklin;"[544]--but at this time there was heard
    A cry for room, though not a phantom stirred.

                        LXXXV.

    At length with jostling, elbowing, and the aid
      Of Cherubim appointed to that post,
    The devil Asmodeus[545] to the circle made
      His way, and looked as if his journey cost
    Some trouble. When his burden down he laid,
      "What's this?" cried Michael; "why, 'tis not a ghost?"
    "I know it," quoth the Incubus; "but he
    Shall be one, if you leave the affair to me.

                        LXXXVI.

    "Confound the renegado![546] I have sprained
      My left wing, he's so heavy;[547] one would think
    Some of his works about his neck were chained.
      But to the point; while hovering o'er the brink
    Of Skiddaw (where as usual it still rained),
      I saw a taper, far below me, wink,
    And stooping, caught this fellow at a libel--[ho]
    No less on History--than the Holy Bible.

                        LXXXVII.

    "The former is the Devil's scripture, and
      The latter yours, good Michael: so the affair
    Belongs to all of us, you understand.
      I snatched him up just as you see him there,
    And brought him off for sentence out of hand:
      I've scarcely been ten minutes in the air--
    At least a quarter it can hardly be:
    I dare say that his wife is still at tea."[548]

                        LXXXVIII.

    Here Satan said, "I know this man of old,
      And have expected him for some time here;
    A sillier fellow you will scarce behold,
      Or more conceited in his petty sphere:
    But surely it was not worth while to fold
      Such trash below your wing, Asmodeus dear:
    We had the poor wretch safe (without being bored
    With carriage) coming of his own accord.

                        LXXXIX.

    "But since he's here, let's see what he has done."
      "Done!" cried Asmodeus, "he anticipates
    The very business you are now upon,
      And scribbles as if head clerk to the Fates.[hp]
    Who knows to what his ribaldry may run,
      When such an ass[549] as this, like Balaam's, prates?"
    "Let's hear," quoth Michael, "what he has to say:
    You know we're bound to that in every way."

                        XC.

    Now the bard, glad to get an audience, which
      By no means often was his case below,
    Began to cough, and hawk, and hem, and pitch
      His voice into that awful note of woe
    To all unhappy hearers within reach
      Of poets when the tide of rhyme's in flow;[550]
    But stuck fast with his first hexameter,
    Not one of all whose gouty feet would stir.

                        XCI.

    But ere the spavined dactyls could be spurred
      Into recitative, in great dismay
    Both Cherubim and Seraphim were heard
      To murmur loudly through their long array;
    And Michael rose ere he could get a word
      Of all his foundered verses under way,
    And cried, "For God's sake stop, my friend! 'twere best--[551]
    '_Non Di, non homines_'--you know the rest."[552]

                        XCII.

    A general bustle spread throughout the throng,
      Which seemed to hold all verse in detestation;
    The Angels had of course enough of song
      When upon service; and the generation
    Of ghosts had heard too much in life, not long
      Before, to profit by a new occasion:
    The Monarch, mute till then, exclaimed, "What! what![553]
    _Pye_[554] come again? No more--no more of that!"

                        XCIII.

    The tumult grew; an universal cough
      Convulsed the skies, as during a debate,
    When Castlereagh has been up long enough
      (Before he was first minister of state,
    I mean--the _slaves hear now_); some cried "Off, off!"
      As at a farce; till, grown quite desperate,
    The Bard Saint Peter prayed to interpose
    (Himself an author) only for his prose.

                        XCIV.

    The varlet was not an ill-favoured knave;[hq][555]
      A good deal like a vulture in the face,
    With a hook nose and a hawk's eye, which gave
      A smart and sharper-looking sort of grace
    To his whole aspect, which, though rather grave,
      Was by no means so ugly as his case;
    But that, indeed, was hopeless as can be,
    Quite a poetic felony "_de se_."

                        XCV.

    Then Michael blew his trump, and stilled the noise
      With one still greater, as is yet the mode
    On earth besides; except some grumbling voice,
      Which now and then will make a slight inroad
    Upon decorous silence, few will twice
      Lift up their lungs when fairly overcrowed;
    And now the Bard could plead his own bad cause,
    With all the attitudes of self-applause.

                        XCVI.

    He said--(I only give the heads)--he said,
      He meant no harm in scribbling; 'twas his way
    Upon all topics; 'twas, besides, his bread,
      Of which he buttered both sides; 'twould delay
    Too long the assembly (he was pleased to dread),
      And take up rather more time than a day,
    To name his works--he would but cite a few--[hr]
    "Wat Tyler"--"Rhymes on Blenheim"--"Waterloo."[556]

                        XCVII.

    He had written praises of a Regicide;[557]
      He had written praises of all kings whatever;
    He had written for republics far and wide,
      And then against them bitterer than ever;
    For pantisocracy he once had cried[558]
      Aloud, a scheme less moral than 'twas clever;
    Then grew a hearty anti-jacobin--
    Had turned his coat--and would have turned his skin.

                        XCVIII.

    He had sung against all battles, and again
      In their high praise and glory; he had called
    Reviewing "the ungentle craft," and then[559]
      Became as base a critic as e'er crawled--
    Fed, paid, and pampered by the very men
      By whom his muse and morals had been mauled:
    He had written much blank verse, and blanker prose,
    And more of both than any body knows.

                        XCIX.

    He had written Wesley's[560] life:--here turning round
      To Satan, "Sir, I'm ready to write yours,
    In two octavo volumes, nicely bound,
      With notes and preface, all that most allures
    The pious purchaser; and there's no ground
      For fear, for I can choose my own reviewers:
    So let me have the proper documents,
    That I may add you to my other saints."

                        C.

    Satan bowed, and was silent. "Well, if you,
      With amiable modesty, decline
    My offer, what says Michael? There are few
      Whose memoirs could be rendered more divine.
    Mine is a pen of all work;[561] not so new
      As it was once, but I would make you shine
    Like your own trumpet. By the way, my own
    Has more of brass in it, and is as well blown.[hs]

                        CI.

    "But talking about trumpets, here's my 'Vision!'
      Now you shall judge, all people--yes--you shall
    Judge with my judgment! and by my decision
      Be guided who shall enter heaven or fall.
    I settle all these things by intuition,
      Times present, past, to come--Heaven--Hell--and all,
    Like King Alfonso[562]. When I thus see double,
    I save the Deity some worlds of trouble."

                        CII.

    He ceased, and drew forth an MS.; and no
      Persuasion on the part of Devils, Saints,
    Or Angels, now could stop the torrent; so
      He read the first three lines of the contents:
    But at the fourth, the whole spiritual show
    Had vanished, with variety of scents,
    Ambrosial and sulphureous, as they sprang,
    Like lightning, off from his "melodious twang."[563]

                        CIII.

    Those grand heroics acted as a spell;
      The Angels stopped their ears and plied their pinions;
    The Devils ran howling, deafened, down to Hell;
      The ghosts fled, gibbering, for their own dominions--
    (For 'tis not yet decided where they dwell,
      And I leave every man to his opinions);
    Michael took refuge in his trump--but, lo!
    His teeth were set on edge, he could not blow!

                        CIV.

    Saint Peter, who has hitherto been known
      For an impetuous saint, upraised his keys,
    And at the fifth line knocked the poet down;[564]
      Who fell like Phaeton, but more at ease,
    Into his lake, for there he did not drown;
      A different web being by the Destinies
    Woven for the Laureate's final wreath, whene'er
    Reform shall happen either here or there.

                        CV.

    He first sank to the bottom--like his works,
      But soon rose to the surface--like himself;
    For all corrupted things are buoyed like corks,[565]
      By their own rottenness, light as an elf,
    Or wisp that flits o'er a morass: he lurks,
      It may be, still, like dull books on a shelf,
    In his own den, to scrawl some "Life" or "Vision,"[ht]
    As Welborn says--"the Devil turned precisian."[566]

                        CVI.

    As for the rest, to come to the conclusion
      Of this true dream, the telescope is gone[hu]
    Which kept my optics free from all delusion,
      And showed me what I in my turn have shown;
    All I saw farther, in the last confusion,
      Was, that King George slipped into Heaven for one;
    And when the tumult dwindled to a calm,
    I left him practising the hundredth psalm.[567]

                                                        R^a^ Oct. 4, 1821.

[493] {482}[These were not the expressions employed by Lord Eldon. The
Chancellor laid down the principle that "damages cannot be recovered for
a work which is in its nature calculated to do an injury to the public,"
and assuming _Wat Tyler_ to be of this description, he refused the
injunction until Southey should have established his right to the
property by an action. _Wat Tyler_ was written at the age of nineteen,
when Southey was a republican, and was entrusted to two booksellers,
Messrs. Ridgeway and Symonds, who agreed to publish it, but never put it
to press. The MS. was not returned to the author, and in February, 1817,
at the interval of twenty-two years, when his sentiments were widely
different, it was printed, to his great annoyance, by W. Benbow (see his
_Scourge for the Laureate_ (1825), p. 14), Sherwood, Neely and Jones,
John Fairburn, and others. It was reported that 60,000 copies were sold
(see _Life and Correspondence of R. Southey_, 1850, iv. 237, 241, 249,
252).]

[494] [William Smith, M.P. for Norwich, attacked Southey in the House of
Commons on the 14th of March, 1817, and the Laureate replied by a letter
in the _Courier_, dated March 17, 1817, and by a letter "To William
Smith, Esq., M.P." (see _Essays Moral and Political_, by R. Southey,
1832, ii. 7-31). The exact words used were, "the determined malignity of
a renegade" (see Hansard's _Parl. Debates_, xxxv. 1088).]

[495] [One of Southey's juvenile poems is an "Inscription for the
Apartment in Chepstow Castle, where Henry Martin, the Regicide, was
imprisoned thirty years" (see Southey's _Poems_, 1797, p. 59). Canning
parodied it in the _Anti-jacobin_ (see his well-known "Inscription for
the Door of the Cell in Newgate, where Mrs. Brownrigg, the
'Prentice-cide, was confined, previous to her Execution," _Poetry of the
Anti-jacobin_, 1828, p. 6).]

[498] [Walter Savage Landor (1775-1864) had recently published a volume
of Latin poems (_Idyllia Heroica Decem. Librum Phaleuciorum Unum_.
Partim jam primum Partim iterum atque tertio edit Savagius Landor.
Accedit Quaestiuncula cur Poetae Latini Recentiores minus leguntur, Pisis,
1820, 410). In his Preface to the _Vision of Judgement_, Southey
illustrates his denunciation of "Men of diseased hearts," etc. (_vide
ante_, p. 476), by a quotation from the Latin essay: "Summi poetae in
omni poetarum saeculo viri fuerunt probi: in nostris id vidimus et
videmus; neque alius est error a veritate longius quam magna ingenia
magnis necessario corrumpi vitiis," etc. (_Idyllia_, p. 197). It was a
cardinal maxim of the Lake School "that there can be no great poet who
is not a good man.... His heart must be pure" (see Table Talk, by S. T.
Coleridge, August 20, 1833); and Landor's testimony was welcome and
consolatory. "Of its author," he adds, "I will only say in this place,
that, to have obtained his approbation as a poet, and possessed his
friendship as a man, will be remembered among the honours of my life."
Now, apart from the essay and its evident application, Byron had
probably observed that among the _Phaleucia_, or Hendecasyllables, were
included some exquisite lines _Ad Sutheium_ (on the death of Herbert
Southey), followed by some extremely unpleasant ones on _Taunto_ and his
tongue, and would naturally conclude that "Savagius" was ready to do
battle for the Laureate if occasion arose. Hence the side issue. With
regard to the "Ithyphallics," there are portions of the Latin poems
(afterwards expunged, see _Poemata et Inscriptiones_, Moxon, 1847)
included in the Pisa volume which might warrant the description; but
from a note to _The Island_ (Canto II. stanza xvii. line 10) it may be
inferred that some earlier collection of Latin verses had come under
Byron's notice. For Landor's various estimates of Byron's works and
genius, see _Works_, 1876, iv. 44-46, 88, 89, etc.]

England and Hanover on cushions of purple and the broken wand crossing
it. At the altar four Royal banners covered with golden emblems were
strewed upon the ground, as if their office was completed; the altar was
piled with consecrated gold plate, and the whole aspect of the Chapel

coffin, again enclosed in another mahogany coffin, and the whole finally
placed in the state coffin of Spanish mahogany, covered with the richest
Genoa velvet of royal purple, a few shades deeper in tint than Garter
blue. The lid was divided into three compartments by double rows of
silver-gilt nails, and in the compartment at the head, over a rich star
of the Order of the Garter was placed the Royal Arms of England,
beautifully executed in dead Gold.... In the lower compartment at the
feet was the British Lion _Rampant, regardant_, supporting a shield with
the letters G. R. surrounded with the garter and motto of the same order

Wilkes squints more than "a gentleman should squint." The costume--long
coat, waistcoat buttoned to the neck, knee-breeches, and stockings--is
not unpleasing, but the expression of the face is something between a
leer and a sneer. Walpole (_Letters_, 1858, vii. 274) describes another

squinting tenderly at his daughter. It is a caricature of the Devil

following February, and on subsequent occasions, he endeavoured to
induce the House to rescind the resolutions passed January 19, 1764,
under which he had been expelled from Parliament, and named as
blasphemous, obscene, etc. Finally, May, 1782, he obtained a substantial
majority on a division, and the obnoxious resolutions were ordered to be
expunged from the journals of the House.]

[535] [Bute, as leader of the king's party, was an open enemy; Grafton,
a half-hearted friend. The duke (1736-1811) would have visited him in
the Tower (1763), "to hear from himself his own story and his defence;"
but rejected an appeal which Wilkes addressed to him (May 3) to become
surety for bail. He feared that such a step might "come under the
denomination of an insult on the Crown." A writ of _Habeas Corpus_ (see
line 8) was applied for by Lord Temple and others, and, May 6, Wilkes
was discharged by Lord Chief Justice Pratt, on the ground of privilege.
Three years later (November 1, 1766), on his return from Italy, Wilkes
sought to obtain Grafton's protection and interest; but the duke, though
he consulted Chatham, and laid Wilkes's letter before the King, decided
to "take no notice" of this second appeal. In his _Autobiography_
Grafton is careful to define "the extent of his knowledge" of Mr.
Wilkes, and to explain that he was not "one of his intimates"--a
_caveat_ which warrants the statement of Junius that "as for Mr. Wilkes,
it is, perhaps, the greatest misfortune of his life, that you should
have so many compensations to make in the closet for your former
friendship with him. Your gracious Master understands your character;
and makes you a persecutor because you have been a friend" ("Letter
(xii.) to the Duke of Grafton," May 30, 1769).--_Memoirs of Augustus
Henry, Third Duke of Grafton_, by Sir W. Anson, Bart., D.C.L., 1898, pp.
190-197.]

[536] {511}[In 1774 Wilkes was elected Lord Mayor, and in the following
spring it fell to his lot to present to the King a remonstrance from the
Livery against the continuance of the war with America. Walpole (April
17, 1775, Letters, 1803, vi. 257) says that "he used his triumph with
moderation--in modern language with good breeding." The King is said to
have been agreeably surprised at his demeanour. In his old age (1790) he
voted against the Whigs. A pasquinade, written by Sheridan, Tickell, and
Lord John Townshend, anticipated the devil's insinuations--

    "Johnny Wilkes, Johnny Wilkes,
        Thou greatest of bilks,
    How changed are the notes you now sing!

these bills [_The Plot Discovered, etc._, by S. T. Coleridge, November
28, 1795, _Essays on his own Times_, 1850, i. 56] is an attempt to

Byron wrote, in his _Journal_ of November 23, 1813, "I don't know what
to think. Why should Junius be yet dead?.... the man must be alive, and
will never die without the disclosure" (_Letters_, 1893, ii. 334); but
an article (by Brougham) in the _Edinburgh Review_, vol. xxix. p. 94, on
_The Identity of Junius with a Distinguished Living Character
established_ (see _Letters_, 1900, iv. 210), seems to have almost
persuaded him that "Francis is Junius." (For a _resume_ of the arguments

and--_there_ is his eulogy."--Letter to Moore, September 27, 1813,

"I have not seen the _Liberal_," wrote Southey to Wynn, October 26,
1822, "but a Leeds paper has been sent me ... including among its
extracts the description and behaviour of a certain 'varlet.' He has not
offended me in the way that the pious painter exasperated the Devil"

and seditious poem, in the _Preface_ to an edition of _Wat Tyler_,
published by W. Hone in 1817; and it is also included in an "Appendix"
entitled _The Stripling Bard, or the Apostate Laureate_, affixed to
another edition issued in the same year by John Fairburn. The purport
and _motif_ of these excellent rhymes is non-patriotic if not
Jacobinical, but, for some reason, the poem has been considered
improving for the young, and is included in many "Poetry Books" for
schools. _The Poet's Pilgrimage to Waterloo_ was published in 1816, not
long before the resuscitation of _Wat Tyler_.]

[558] ["He has written _Wat Tyler_, and taken the office of poet
laureate--he has, in the _Life of Henry Kirke White_ (see Byron's note

reviewer--he was one of the projectors of a scheme called
'pantisocracy,' for having all things, including women, in common
(_query_ common women?)."--_Some Observations upon an Article in
Blackwood's Magazine_ (No. xxix., August, 1819), _Letters_, 1900
[Appendix IX.], iv. 483. The invention or, possibly, disinterment of
this calumny was no doubt a counterblast on Byron's part to the supposed
charge of a "league of incest" (at Diodati, in 1816), which he
maintained had been disseminated by Coleridge on the authority of
Southey (_vide ante_, p. 475). It is, perhaps, unnecessary to state that
before Pantisocracy was imagined or devised, one of the future
pantisocrats, Robert Lovell, was married to Mary Fricker; that Robert
Southey was engaged to be married to her sister Edith; and that, as a
result of the birth and evolution of the scheme, Coleridge became
engaged to be married to a third sister, Sarah, hitherto loverless, in
order that "every Jack should have his Jill," and the world begin anew
in a second Eden across the seas. All things were to be held in common,
in order that each man might hold his wife in particular.]

[560] [Southey's _Life of Wesley, and Rise and Progress of Methodism_,
in two volumes octavo, was published in 1820. In a "Memento" written in
a blank leaf of the first volume, Coleridge expressed his desire that
his copy should be given to Southey as a bequest. "One or other volume,"
he writes, "was more often in my hands than any other in my ragged
book-regiment ... How many an hour of self-oblivion do I owe to this
Life of Wesley!"--Third ed. 1846, i. xv.]

[562] {523}King Alfonso, speaking of the Ptolomean system, said, that
"had he been consulted at the creation of the world, he would have
spared the Maker some absurdities. [Alphonso X., King of Castile
(1221-1284), surnamed the Wise and the Astronomer, "gave no small
encouragement to the Jewish rabbis." Under his patronage Judah de Toledo
translated the works of Avicenna, and improved them by a new division of
the stars. Moreover, "he sent for about 50 learned men from Gascony,
Paris, and other places, to translate the tables of Ptolemy, and to
compile a more correct set of them (i.e. the famous _Tabulae Alphonsinae_)
... The king himself presided over the assembly."--_Mod. Univ. Hist._,
xiii. 304, 305, note(U).

Alfonso has left behind him the reputation of a Castilian
Hamlet--"infinite in faculty," but "unpregnant of his cause." "He was
more fit," says Mariana (_Hist._, lib. xiii. c. 20), "for letters than
for the government of his subjects; he studied the heavens and watched
the stars, but forgot the earth and lost his kingdom." Nevertheless his
works do follow him. "He is to be remembered for his poetry
(_'Cantigas'_, chants in honour of the Virgin, and _'Tesoro'_ a treatise
on the philosopher's stone), for his astronomical tables, which all the
progress of science have not deprived of their value, and for his great
work on legislation, which is at this moment an authority in both
hemispheres."--_Hist. of Spanish Literature_, by G. Ticknor, 1888, i. 7.

Byron got the quip about Alfonso and "the absurdities of creation" from
Bayle (_Dict_., 1735, art. "Castile"), who devotes a long note (H) to a
somewhat mischievous apology for the king's apparent profanity. Bayle's
immediate authority is Le Bovier de Fontenelle, in his _Entretiens sur
la Pluralite des Mondes_, 1686, p. 38, "L'embaras de tous ces cercles
estoit si grand, que dans un temps ou l'on ne connoissoit encore rien de
meilleur, un roy d'Aragon (_sic_) grand mathematicien mais apparemment

  A VERY MOURNFUL BALLAD[568] ON THE SIEGE AND CONQUEST OF ALHAMA.[569]


_Which, in the Arabic language, is to the following purport_[570]


                        1.

    The Moorish King rides up and down.
    Through Granada's royal town:
    From Elvira's gates to those
    Of Bivarambla on he goes.
                        Woe is me, Alhama![hv][571]

                        2.

    Letters to the Monarch tell
    How Alhama's city fell:
    In the fire the scroll he threw,
    And the messenger he slew.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        3.

    He quits his mule, and mounts his horse,
    And through the street directs his course;
    Through the street of Zacatin
    To the Alhambra spurring in.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        4.

    When the Alhambra walls he gained,
    On the moment he ordained
    That the trumpet straight should sound
    With the silver clarion round.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        5.

    And when the hollow drums of war
    Beat the loud alarm afar,
    That the Moors of town and plain
    Might answer to the martial strain.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        6.

    Then the Moors, by this aware,
    That bloody Mars recalled them there,
    One by one, and two by two,
    To a mighty squadron grew.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        7.

    Out then spake an aged Moor
    In these words the king before,
    "Wherefore call on us, oh King?
    What may mean this gathering?"
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        8.

    "Friends! ye have, alas! to know
    Of a most disastrous blow--
    That the Christians, stern and bold,
    Have obtained Alhama's hold."
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        9.

    Out then spake old Alfaqui,[572]
    With his beard so white to see,
    "Good King! thou art justly served,
    Good King! this thou hast deserved.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        10.

    "By thee were slain, in evil hour,
    The Abencerrage, Granada's flower;
    And strangers were received by thee,
    Of Cordova the Chivalry.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        11.

    "And for this, oh King! is sent
    On thee a double chastisement;
    Thee and thine, thy crown and realm,
    One last wreck shall overwhelm.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        12.

    "He who holds no laws in awe,
    He must perish by the law;
    And Granada must be won,
    And thyself with her undone."
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        13.

    Fire flashed from out the old Moor's eyes,
    The Monarch's wrath began to rise,
    Because he answered, and because
    He spake exceeding well of laws.[573]
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        14.

    "There is no law to say such things
    As may disgust the ear of kings:"--
    Thus, snorting with his choler, said
    The Moorish King, and doomed him dead.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        15.

    Moor Alfaqui! Moor Alfaqui![574]
    Though thy beard so hoary be,[hw]
    The King hath sent to have thee seized,
    For Alhama's loss displeased.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        16.

    And to fix thy head upon
    High Alhambra's loftiest stone;
    That this for thee should be the law,
    And others tremble when they saw.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        17.

    "Cavalier, and man of worth!
    Let these words of mine go forth;
    Let the Moorish Monarch know,
    That to him I nothing owe.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        18.

    "But on my soul Alhama weighs,
    And on my inmost spirit preys;
    And if the King his land hath lost,
    Yet others may have lost the most.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        19.

    "Sires have lost their children, wives
    Their lords, and valiant men their lives!
    One what best his love might claim
    Hath lost, another wealth, or fame.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        20.

    "I lost a damsel in that hour,
    Of all the land the loveliest flower;
    Doubloons a hundred I would pay,
    And think her ransom cheap that day."
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        21.

    And as these things the old Moor said,
    They severed from the trunk his head;
    And to the Alhambra's wall with speed
    'Twas carried, as the King decreed.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        22.

    And men and infants therein weep
    Their loss, so heavy and so deep;
    Granada's ladies, all she rears
    Within her walls, burst into tears.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                        23.

    And from the windows o'er the walls
    The sable web of mourning falls;
    The King weeps as a woman o'er
    His loss, for it is much and sore.
                        Woe is me, Alhama!

                       SONETTO DI VITTORELLI.[575]

                               PER MONACA.

     Sonetto composto in nome di un genitore, a cui era motta poco
     innanzi una figlia appena maritata: e diretto al genitore della
     sacra sposa.

    Di due vaghe donzelle, oneste, accorte
        Lieti e miseri padri il ciel ne feo,
        Il ciel, die degne di piu nobil sorte
        L' una e l' altra veggendo, ambe chiedeo.

    La mia fu tolta da veloce morte
        A le fumanti tede d' Imeneo:
        La tua, Francesco, in suggellate porte
        Eterna prigioniera or si rendeo.

    Ma tu almeno potrai dalla gelosa
        Irremeabil soglia, ove s' asconde,
        La sua tenera udir voce pietosa.

    Io verso un flume d' amarissim' onde,
        Corro a quel marmo, in cui la figlia or posa:
        Batto, e ribatto, ma nessun risponde.

        [_Opere Edite e Postume_ di J. Vittorelli, Bassano, 1841, p. 294.]



                       TRANSLATION FROM VITTORELLI.


                                ON A NUN.

     Sonnet composed in the name of a father, whose daughter had
     recently died shortly after her marriage; and addressed to the
     father of her who had lately taken the veil.

    Of two fair virgins, modest, though admired,
        Heaven made us happy; and now, wretched sires,
        Heaven for a nobler doom their worth desires,
        And gazing upon _either, both_ required.

    Mine, while the torch of Hymen newly fired
        Becomes extinguished,--soon--too soon expires;
        But thine, within the closing grate retired,
        Eternal captive, to her God aspires.

    But _thou_ at least from out the jealous door,
        Which shuts between your never-meeting eyes,
        May'st hear her sweet and pious voice once more:

    I to the marble, where _my_ daughter lies,
        Rush,--the swoln flood of bitterness I pour,
        And knock, and knock, and knock--but none replies.

                      [First published, _Childe Harold_, Canto IV., 1818.]



                   ON THE BUST OF HELEN BY CANOVA.[576]

    In this beloved marble view
      Above the works and thoughts of Man,
    What Nature _could_ but _would not_ do,
      And Beauty and Canova _can!_
    Beyond Imagination's power,
      Beyond the Bard's defeated art,
    With Immortality her dower,
      Behold the _Helen_ of the heart.

                                                      _November_ 23, 1816.

                         VENICE. A FRAGMENT.[577]

    'Tis midnight--but it is not dark
    Within thy spacious place, St. Mark!
    The Lights within, the Lamps without,
    Shine above the revel rout.
    The brazen Steeds are glittering o'er
    The holy building's massy door,
    Glittering with their collars of gold,
    The goodly work of the days of old--
    And the winged Lion stern and solemn
    Frowns from the height of his hoary column,
    Facing the palace in which doth lodge
    The ocean-city's dreaded Doge.
    The palace is proud--but near it lies,
    Divided by the "Bridge of Sighs,"
    The dreary dwelling where the State
    Enchains the captives of their hate:
    These--they perish or they pine;
    But which their doom may none divine:
    Many have passed that Arch of pain,
    But none retraced their steps again.

    It is a princely colonnade!
    And wrought around a princely place,
    When that vast edifice displayed
    Looks with its venerable face
    Over the far and subject sea,
    Which makes the fearless isles so free!
    And 'tis a strange and noble pile,
    Pillared into many an aisle:
    Every pillar fair to see,
    Marble--jasper--and porphyry--
    The Church of St. Mark--which stands hard by
    With fretted pinnacles on high,
    And Cupola and minaret;
    More like the mosque of orient lands,
    Than the fanes wherein we pray,
    And Mary's blessed likeness stands.--

                                               Venice, _December_ 6, 1816.




                    SO WE'LL GO NO MORE A-ROVING.[578]

                        1.

    So we'll go no more a-roving
      So late into the night,
    Though the heart be still as loving,
      And the moon be still as bright.

                        2.

    For the sword outwears its sheath,
      And the soul wears out the breast,
    And the heart must pause to breathe,
      And Love itself have rest.

                        3.

    Though the night was made for loving,
      And the day returns too soon,
    Yet we'll go no more a-roving
      By the light of the moon.

                                                          _Feb_. 28, 1817.

                [LORD BYRON'S VERSES ON SAM ROGERS.][579]


                                QUESTION.

    Nose and Chin that make a knocker,[hx]
    Wrinkles that would puzzle Cocker;
    Mouth that marks the envious Scorner,
    With a Scorpion in each corner
    Curling up his tail to sting you,[hy]
    In the place that most may wring you;
    Eyes of lead-like hue and gummy,
    Carcase stolen from some mummy,
    Bowels--(but they were forgotten,
    Save the Liver, and that's rotten),                                 10
    Skin all sallow, flesh all sodden,
    Form the Devil would frighten G--d in.
    Is't a Corpse stuck up for show,[580]
    Galvanized at times to go?
    With the Scripture has't connection,[hz]
    New proof of the Resurrection?
    Vampire, Ghost, or Goul (_sic_), what is it?
    I would walk ten miles to miss it.



                                 ANSWER.

    Many passengers arrest one,
    To demand the same free question.                                   20
    Shorter's my reply and franker,--
    That's the Bard, and Beau, and Banker:
    Yet, if you could bring about
    Just to turn him inside out,
    Satan's self would seem less sooty,
    And his present aspect--Beauty.
    Mark that (as he masks the bilious)
    Air so softly supercilious,
    Chastened bow, and mock humility,
    Almost sickened to Servility:                                       30
    Hear his tone (which is to talking
    That which creeping is to walking--
    Now on all fours, now on tiptoe):
    Hear the tales he lends his lip to--
    Little hints of heavy scandals--
    Every friend by turns he handles:
    All that women or that men do
    Glides forth in an inuendo (_sic_)--
    Clothed in odds and ends of humour,
    Herald of each paltry rumour--                                      40
    From divorces down to dresses,
    Woman's frailties, Man's excesses:
    All that life presents of evil
    Make for him a constant revel.
    You're his foe--for that he fears you,
    And in absence blasts and sears you:
    You're his friend--for that he hates you,
    First obliges, and then baits you,
    Darting on the opportunity
    When to do it with impunity:                                        50
    You are neither--then he'll flatter,
    Till he finds some trait for satire;
    Hunts your weak point out, then shows it,
    Where it injures, to expose it
    In the mode that's most insidious,
    Adding every trait that's hideous--
    From the bile, whose blackening river
    Rushes through his Stygian liver.

    Then he thinks himself a lover--[581]
    Why? I really can't discover,                                       60
    In his mind, age, face, or figure;
    Viper broth might give him vigour:
    Let him keep the cauldron steady,
    He the venom has already.

    For his faults--he has but _one_;
    'Tis but Envy, when all's done:
    He but pays the pain he suffers,
    Clipping, like a pair of Snuffers,
    Light that ought to burn the brighter
    For this temporary blighter.                                        70
    He's the Cancer of his Species,
    And will eat himself to pieces,--
    Plague personified and Famine,--
    Devil, whose delight is damning.[582]
    For his merits--don't you know 'em?[ia]
    Once he wrote a pretty Poem.

                                                                     1818.

                              THE DUEL.[583]

                        1.

    'Tis fifty years, and yet their fray
    To us might seem but yesterday.
    Tis fifty years, and three to boot,
    Since, hand to hand, and foot to foot,
    And heart to heart, and sword to sword,
    One of our Ancestors was gored.
    I've seen the sword that slew him;[584] he,
    The slain, stood in a like degree
    To thee, as he, the Slayer, stood
    (Oh had it been but other blood!)
    In kin and Chieftainship to me.
    Thus came the Heritage to thee.

                        2.

    To me the Lands of him who slew
      Came through a line of yore renowned;
    For I can boast a race as true
      To Monarchs crowned, and some discrowned,
    As ever Britain's Annals knew:
    For the first Conqueror gave us Ground,[585]
      And the last Conquered owned the line
      Which was my mother's, and is mine.

                        3.

    I loved thee--I will not say _how_,
    Since things like these are best forgot:
    Perhaps thou may'st imagine now
      Who loved thee, and who loved thee not.
    And thou wert wedded to another,[586]
      And I at last another wedded:
    I am a father, thou a mother,
      To Strangers vowed, with strangers bedded.
    For land to land, even blood to blood--
      Since leagued of yore our fathers were--
    Our manors and our birthright stood;
    And not unequal had I wooed,
      If to have wooed thee I could dare.
    But this I never dared--even yet
    When naught is left but to forget.
      I feel that I could only love:
    To sue was never meant for me,
    And least of all to sue to thee;
    For many a bar, and many a feud,
    Though never told, well understood
      Rolled like a river wide between--
    And then there was the Curse of blood,
      Which even my Heart's can not remove.
      Alas! how many things have been!
    Since we were friends; for I alone
    Feel more for thee than can be shown.

                        4.

    How many things! I loved thee--thou
      Loved'st me not: another was
    The Idol of thy virgin vow,
      And I was, what I am, Alas!
    And what he is, and what thou art,
      And what we were, is like the rest:
      We must endure it as a test,
    And old Ordeal of the Heart.[587]

                                                  Venice, _Dec_. 29, 1818.




                         STANZAS TO THE PO.[588]

                        1.

    River, that rollest by the ancient walls,
      Where dwells the Lady of my love, when she
    Walks by thy brink, and there perchance recalls
      A faint and fleeting memory of me:

                        2.

    What if thy deep and ample stream should be
      A mirror of my heart, where she may read
    The thousand thoughts I now betray to thee,
      Wild as thy wave, and headlong as thy speed!

                        3.

    What do I say--a mirror of my heart?
      Are not thy waters sweeping, dark, and strong?
    Such as my feelings were and are, thou art;
      And such as thou art were my passions long.

                        4.

    Time may have somewhat tamed them,--not for ever;
      Thou overflow'st thy banks, and not for aye
    Thy bosom overboils, congenial river!
      Thy floods subside, and mine have sunk away:

                        5.

    But left long wrecks behind, and now again,[ib]
      Borne in our old unchanged career, we move:
    Thou tendest wildly onwards to the main,
      And I--to loving _one_ I should not love.

                        6.

    The current I behold will sweep beneath
      Her native walls, and murmur at her feet;
    Her eyes will look on thee, when she shall breathe
      The twilight air, unharmed by summer's heat.

                        7.

    She will look on thee,--I have looked on thee,
      Full of that thought: and, from that moment, ne'er
    Thy waters could I dream of, name, or see,
      Without the inseparable sigh for her!

                        8.

    Her bright eyes will be imaged in thy stream,--
      Yes! they will meet the wave I gaze on now:
    Mine cannot witness, even in a dream,
      That happy wave repass me in its flow!

                        9.

    The wave that bears my tears returns no more:
      Will she return by whom that wave shall sweep?--
    Both tread thy banks, both wander on thy shore,
      I by thy source, she by the dark-blue deep.[ic]


                        10.

    But that which keepeth us apart is not
      Distance, nor depth of wave, nor space of earth,
    But the distraction of a various lot,
      As various as the climates of our birth.

                        11.

    A stranger loves the Lady of the land,[id]
      Born far beyond the mountains, but his blood
    Is all meridian, as if never fanned
      By the black wind that chills the polar flood.[ie]

                        12.

    My blood is all meridian; were it not,
      I had not left my clime, nor should I be,[if]
    In spite of tortures, ne'er to be forgot,
      A slave again of love,--at least of thee.

                        13.

    'Tis vain to struggle--let me perish young--
      Live as I lived, and love as I have loved;
    To dust if I return, from dust I sprung,
      And then, at least, my heart can ne'er be moved.

                                                               June, 1819.

          SONNET ON THE NUPTIALS OF THE MARQUIS ANTONIO CAVALLI
            WITH THE COUNTESS CLELIA RASPONI OF RAVENNA.[589]

    A noble Lady of the Italian shore
      Lovely and young, herself a happy bride,
      Commands a verse, and will not be denied,
    From me a wandering Englishman; I tore
    One sonnet, but invoke the muse once more
      To hail these gentle hearts which Love has tied,
      In Youth, Birth, Beauty, genially allied
    And blest with Virtue's soul, and Fortune's store.
    A sweeter language, and a luckier bard
      Were worthier of your hopes, Auspicious Pair!
    And of the sanctity of Hymen's shrine,
      But,--since I cannot but obey the Fair,
    To render your new state your true reward,
      May your Fate be like _Hers_, and unlike _mine._

                                                   Ravenna, July 31, 1819.

      [From an autograph MS. in the possession of the Lady Dorchester, now
                                              for the first time printed.]




                     SONNET TO THE PRINCE REGENT.[ig]
          ON THE REPEAL OF LORD EDWARD FITZGERALD'S FORFEITURE.

    To be the father of the fatherless,
      To stretch the hand from the throne's height, and raise
      _His_ offspring, who expired in other days
    To make thy Sire's sway by a kingdom less,--[ih]
    _This_ is to be a monarch, and repress
      Envy into unutterable praise.
      Dismiss thy guard, and trust thee to such traits,
    For who would lift a hand, except to bless?[ii]
      Were it not easy, Sir, and is't not sweet
      To make thyself beloved? and to be
    Omnipotent by Mercy's means? for thus
      Thy Sovereignty would grow but more complete,
    A despot thou, and yet thy people free,[ij]
      And by the heart--not hand--enslaving us.

                                          Bologna, _August_ 12, 1819.[590]

                  [First published, _Letters and Journals,_ ii. 234, 235.]




                              STANZAS.[591]


                        1.

        Could Love for ever
        Run like a river,
        And Time's endeavour
          Be tried in vain--
        No other pleasure
        With this could measure;
        And like a treasure[ik]
          We'd hug the chain.
        But since our sighing
        Ends not in dying,
        And, formed for flying,
          Love plumes his wing;
        Then for this reason
        Let's love a season;
    But let that season be only Spring.


                        2.

        When lovers parted
        Feel broken-hearted,
        And, all hopes thwarted,
          Expect to die;
        A few years older,
        Ah! how much colder
        They might behold her
          For whom they sigh!
        When linked together,
        In every weather,[il]
        They pluck Love's feather
          From out his wing--
        He'll stay for ever,[im]
        But sadly shiver
    Without his plumage, when past the Spring.[in]

                        3.

        Like Chiefs of Faction,
        His life is action--
        A formal paction
          That curbs his reign,
        Obscures his glory,
        Despot no more, he
        Such territory
          Quits with disdain.
        Still, still advancing,
        With banners glancing,
        His power enhancing,
          He must move on--
        Repose but cloys him,
        Retreat destroys him,
    Love brooks not a degraded throne.

                        4.

        Wait not, fond lover!
        Till years are over,
        And then recover
          As from a dream.
        While each bewailing
        The other's failing.
        With wrath and railing,
          All hideous seem--
        While first decreasing,
        Yet not quite ceasing,
        Wait not till teasing,
          All passion blight:
        If once diminished
        Love's reign is finished--
    Then part in friendship,--and bid good-night.[io]

                        5.

        So shall Affection
        To recollection
        The dear connection
          Bring back with joy:
        You had not waited[ip]
        Till, tired or hated,
        Your passions sated
          Began to cloy.
        Your last embraces
        Leave no cold traces--
        The same fond faces
          As through the past:
        And eyes, the mirrors
        Of your sweet errors,
    Reflect but rapture--not least though last.


                        6.

        True, separations[iq]
        Ask more than patience;
        What desperations
          From such have risen!
        But yet remaining,
        What is't but chaining
        Hearts which, once waning,
          Beat 'gainst their prison?
        Time can but cloy love,
        And use destroy love:
        The winged boy, Love,
          Is but for boys--
        You'll find it torture
        Though sharper, shorter,
    To wean, and not wear out your joys.

                                                       _December_ 1, 1819.

             ODE TO A LADY WHOSE LOVER WAS KILLED BY A BALL,
        WHICH AT THE SAME TIME SHIVERED A PORTRAIT NEXT HIS HEART.


Motto.

     _On peut trouver des femmes qui n'ont jamais eu de galanterie, mais
     il est rare d'en trouver qui n'en aient jamais eu
     qu'une_.--[_Reflexions_ ... du Duc de la Rochefoucauld, No.
     lxxiii.]

                        1.

      Lady! in whose heroic port
    And Beauty, Victor even of Time,
      And haughty lineaments, appear
      Much that is awful, more that's dear--
      Wherever human hearts resort
      _There_ must have been for thee a Court,
      And Thou by acclamation Queen,
      Where never Sovereign yet had been.
    That eye so soft, and yet severe,
      Perchance might look on Love as Crime;
    And yet--regarding thee more near--
    The traces of an unshed tear
      Compressed back to the heart,
    And mellowed Sadness in thine air,
    Which shows that Love hath once been there,
    To those who watch thee will disclose
    More than ten thousand tomes of woes
      Wrung from the vain Romancer's art.
    With thee how proudly Love hath dwelt!
    His full Divinity was felt,
    Maddening the heart he could not melt,
      Till Guilt became Sublime;
    But never yet did Beauty's Zone
    For him surround a lovelier throne,
    Than in that bosom once his own:
      And he the Sun and Thou the Clime
    Together must have made a Heaven
    For which the Future would be given.

                        2.

    And thou hast loved--Oh! not in vain!
      And not as common Mortals love.
        The Fruit of Fire is Ashes,
        The Ocean's tempest dashes
    Wrecks and the dead upon the rocky shore:
    True Passion must the all-searching changes prove,
      The Agony of Pleasure and of Pain,
      Till Nothing but the Bitterness remain;
      And the Heart's Spectre flitting through the brain
    Scoffs at the Exorcism which would remove.

                        3.

    And where is He thou lovedst? in the tomb,
      Where should the happy Lover be!
    For him could Time unfold a brighter doom,
      Or offer aught like thee?
    He in the thickest battle died,
      Where Death is Pride;
    And _Thou_ his widow--not his bride,
      Wer't not more free--
    _Here_ where all love, till Love is made
      A bondage or a trade,
    _Here_--thou so redolent of Beauty,
    In whom Caprice had seemed a duty,
    _Thou_, who could'st trample and despise
    The holiest chain of human ties
    For him, the dear One in thine eyes,
      Broke it no more.
    Thy heart was withered to it's Core,
    It's hopes, it's fears, it's feelings o'er:
    Thy Blood grew Ice when _his_ was shed,
    And Thou the Vestal of the Dead.

                        4.

    Thy Lover died, as All
      Who truly love should die;
    For such are worthy in the fight to fall
      Triumphantly.
    No Cuirass o'er that glowing heart
    The deadly bullet turned apart:
    Love had bestowed a richer Mail,
      Like Thetis on her Son;
    But hers at last was vain, and thine could fail--
      The hero's and the lover's race was run.
    Thy worshipped portrait, thy sweet face,
    _Without_ that bosom kept it's place
      As Thou _within_.
    Oh! enviously destined Ball!
    Shivering thine imaged charms and all
      Those Charms would win:
    Together pierced, the fatal Stroke hath gored
    Votary and Shrine, the adoring and the adored.
      That Heart's last throb was thine, that blood
      Baptized thine Image in it's flood,
      And gushing from the fount of Faith
      O'erflowed with Passion even in Death,
    Constant to thee as in it's hour
    Of rapture in the secret bower.
    Thou too hast kept thy plight full well,
    As many a baffled Heart can tell.

       [From an autograph MS. in the possession of Mr. Murray, now for the
                                                      first time printed.]




                        THE IRISH AVATAR.[ir][592]

"And Ireland, like a bastinadoed elephant, kneeling to receive the
paltry rider."--[_Life of Curran_, ii. 336.]


                        1.

    Ere the daughter of Brunswick is cold in her grave,[593]
    And her ashes still float to their home o'er the tide,
    Lo! George the triumphant speeds over the wave,
      To the long-cherished Isle which he loved like his--bride.

                        2.

    True, the great of her bright and brief Era are gone,
      The rain-bow-like Epoch where Freedom could pause
    For the few little years, out of centuries won,
      Which betrayed not, or crushed not, or wept not her cause.

                        3.

    True, the chains of the Catholic clank o'er his rags,
      The Castle still stands, and the Senate's no more,
    And the Famine which dwelt on her freedomless crags
      Is extending its steps to her desolate shore.

                        4.

    To her desolate shore--where the emigrant stands
      For a moment to gaze ere he flies from his hearth;
    Tears fall on his chain, though it drops from his hands,
      For the dungeon he quits is the place of his birth.

                        5.

    But he comes! the Messiah of Royalty comes!
      Like a goodly Leviathan rolled from the waves;
    Then receive him as best such an advent becomes,[is]
      With a legion of cooks,[594] and an army of slaves!

                        6.

    He comes in the promise and bloom of threescore,
      To perform in the pageant the Sovereign's part--[it]
    But long live the Shamrock, which shadows him o'er!
      Could the Green in his _hat_ be transferred to his _heart!_

                        7.

    Could that long-withered spot but be verdant again,
      And a new spring of noble affections arise--
    Then might Freedom forgive thee this dance in thy chain,
      And this shout of thy slavery which saddens the skies.

                        8.

    Is it madness or meanness which clings to thee now?
      Were he God--as he is but the commonest clay,
    With scarce fewer wrinkles than sins on his brow--
      Such servile devotion might shame him away.

                        9.

    Aye, roar in his train![595] let thine orators lash
      Their fanciful spirits to pamper his pride--
    Not thus did thy Grattan indignantly flash
      His soul o'er the freedom implored and denied.

                        10.

    Ever glorious Grattan! the best of the good!
      So simple in heart, so sublime in the rest!
    With all which Demosthenes wanted endued,
      And his rival, or victor, in all he possessed.

                        11.

    Ere Tully arose in the zenith of Rome,
      Though unequalled, preceded, the task was begun--
    But Grattan sprung up like a god from the tomb
      Of ages, the first, last, the saviour, the _one!_[596]

                        12.

    With the skill of an Orpheus to soften the brute;
      With the fire of Prometheus to kindle mankind;
    Even Tyranny, listening, sate melted or mute,
      And Corruption shrunk scorched from the glance of his mind.

                        13.

    But back to our theme! Back to despots and slaves![iu]
      Feasts furnished by Famine! rejoicings by Pain!
    True Freedom but _welcomes_, while Slavery still _raves_,
      When a week's Saturnalia hath loosened her chain.

                        14.

    Let the poor squalid splendour thy wreck can afford,
      (As the bankrupt's profusion his ruin would hide)
    Gild over the palace, Lo! Erin, thy Lord!
      Kiss his foot with thy blessing--his blessings denied![iv]

                        15.

    Or _if_ freedom past hope be extorted at last,[iw]
      If the idol of brass find his feet are of clay,
    Must what terror or policy wring forth be classed
      With what monarchs ne'er give, but as wolves yield their prey?

                        16.

    Each brute hath its nature; a King's is to _reign_,--
      To _reign!_ in that word see, ye ages, comprised
    The cause of the curses all annals contain,
      From Caesar the dreaded to George the despised!

                        17.

    Wear, Fingal, thy trapping![597] O'Connell, proclaim[ix]
      His accomplishments! _His!!!_ and thy country convince
    Half an age's contempt was an error of fame,
      And that "Hal is the rascaliest, sweetest _young_ prince!"[iy]

                        18.

    Will thy yard of blue riband, poor Fingal, recall
      The fetters from millions of Catholic limbs?
    Or, has it not bound thee the fastest of all
      The slaves, who now hail their betrayer with hymns?

                        19.

    Aye! "Build him a dwelling!" let each give his mite![598]
      Till, like Babel, the new royal dome hath arisen![iz]
    Let thy beggars and helots their pittance unite--
      And a palace bestow for a poor-house and prison!

                        20.

    Spread--spread for Vitellius, the royal repast,
      Till the gluttonous despot be stuffed to the gorge!
    And the roar of his drunkards proclaim him at last
      The Fourth of the fools and oppressors called "George!"

                        21.

    Let the tables be loaded with feasts till they groan!
      Till they _groan_ like thy people, through ages of woe!
    Let the wine flow around the old Bacchanal's throne,
      Like their blood which has flowed, and which yet has to flow.

                        22.

    But let not _his_ name be thine idol alone--
      On his right hand behold a Sejanus appears!
    Thine own Castlereagh! let him still be thine own!
      A wretch never named but with curses and jeers!

                        23.

    Till now, when the Isle which should blush for his birth,
      Deep, deep as the gore which he shed on her soil,
    Seems proud of the reptile which crawled from her earth,
      And for murder repays him with shouts and a smile.[599]

                        24.

    Without one single ray of her genius,--without
      The fancy, the manhood, the fire of her race--
    The miscreant who well might plunge Erin in doubt[ja]
      If _she_ ever gave birth to a being so base.

                        25.

    If she did--let her long-boasted proverb be hushed,
      Which proclaims that from Erin no reptile can spring--
    See the cold-blooded Serpent, with venom full flushed,
      Still warming its folds in the breast of a King![jb]

                        26.

    Shout, drink, feast, and flatter! Oh! Erin, how low
      Wert thou sunk by misfortune and tyranny, till
    Thy welcome of tyrants hath plunged thee below
      The depth of thy deep in a deeper gulf still.

                        27.

    My voice, though but humble, was raised for thy right;[600]
      My vote, as a freeman's, still voted thee free;
    This hand, though but feeble, would arm in thy fight,[jc]
      And this heart, though outworn, had a throb still for _thee!_

                        28.

    Yes, I loved thee and thine, though thou art not my land;[jd]
      I have known noble hearts and great souls in thy sons,
    And I wept with the world, o'er the patriot band
      Who are gone, but I weep them no longer as once.

                        29.

    For happy are they now reposing afar,--
      Thy Grattan, thy Curran, thy Sheridan,[601] all
    Who, for years, were the chiefs in the eloquent war,
      And redeemed, if they have not retarded, thy fall.

                        30.

    Yes, happy are they in their cold English graves!
      Their shades cannot start to thy shouts of to-day--
    Nor the steps of enslavers and chain-kissing slaves[je]
      Be stamped in the turf o'er their fetterless clay.

                        31.

    Till now I had envied thy sons and their shore,
      Though their virtues were hunted, their liberties fled;[jf]
    There was something so warm and sublime in the core
      Of an Irishman's heart, that I envy--thy _dead_.[jg]

                        32.

    Or, if aught in my bosom can quench for an hour
      My contempt for a nation so servile, though sore,
    Which though trod like the worm will not turn upon power,
      'Tis the glory of Grattan, and genius of Moore![jh][602]

       STANZAS WRITTEN ON THE ROAD BETWEEN FLORENCE AND PISA.[603]

                        1.

    Oh, talk not to me of a name great in story--
    The days of our Youth are the days of our glory;
    And the myrtle and ivy of sweet two-and-twenty
    Are worth all your laurels, though ever so plenty.[604]


                        2.

    What are garlands and crowns to the brow that is wrinkled?
    Tis but as a dead flower with May-dew besprinkled:
    Then away with all such from the head that is hoary,
    What care I for the wreaths that can _only_ give glory?

                        3.

    Oh Fame!--if I e'er took delight in thy praises,
    'Twas less for the sake of thy high-sounding phrases,
    Than to see the bright eyes of the dear One discover,
    She thought that I was not unworthy to love her.

                        4.

    _There_ chiefly I sought thee, _there_ only I found thee;
    Her Glance was the best of the rays that surround thee,
    When it sparkled o'er aught that was bright in my story,
    I knew it was Love, and I felt it was Glory.

      Oh! my lonely--lonely--lonely--Pillow!
    Where is my lover? where is my lover?
    Is it his bark which my dreary dreams discover?
      Far--far away! and alone along the billow?

                        2.

      Oh! my lonely--lonely--lonely--Pillow!
    Why must my head ache where his gentle brow lay?
    How the long night flags lovelessly and slowly,
      And my head droops over thee like the willow!

                        3.

      Oh! thou, my sad and solitary Pillow!
    Send me kind dreams to keep my heart from breaking,
    In return for the tears I shed upon thee waking;
      Let me not die till he comes back o'er the billow.

                        4.

      Then if thou wilt--no more my _lonely_ Pillow,
    In one embrace let these arms again enfold him,
    And then expire of the joy--but to behold him!

    But once I dared to lift my eyes--
      To lift my eyes to thee;
    And since that day, beneath the skies,
      No other sight they see.

                        2.

    In vain sleep shuts them in the night--
      The night grows day to me;
    Presenting idly to my sight
      What still a dream must be.

                        3.

    A fatal dream--for many a bar
      Divides thy fate from mine;
    And still my passions wake and war,
      But peace be still with thine.

                     TO THE COUNTESS OF BLESSINGTON.

                        1.

    You have asked for a verse:--the request
      In a rhymer 'twere strange to deny;
    But my Hippocrene was but my breast,
      And my feelings (its fountain) are dry.

                        2.

    Were I now as I was, I had sung
      What Lawrence has painted so well;[607]
    But the strain would expire on my tongue,
      And the theme is too soft for my shell.

                        3.

    I am ashes where once I was fire,
      And the bard in my bosom is dead;
    What I loved I now merely admire,
      And my heart is as grey as my head.

                        4.

    My Life is not dated by years--
      There are _moments_ which act as a plough,
    And there is not a furrow appears
      But is deep in my soul as my brow.

                        5.

    Let the young and the brilliant aspire
      To sing what I gaze on in vain;
    For Sorrow has torn from my lyre
      The string which was worthy the strain.

                                                                        B.

    The Gods of old are silent on the shore.
    Since the great Pan expired, and through the roar
    Of the Ionian waters broke a dread
    Voice which proclaimed "the Mighty Pan is dead."
    How much died with him! false or true--the dream
    Was beautiful which peopled every stream
    With more than finny tenants, and adorned
    The woods and waters with coy nymphs that scorned
    Pursuing Deities, or in the embrace
    Of gods brought forth the high heroic race                          10
    Whose names are on the hills and o'er the seas.

FOOTNOTES:

[568] {529}[Byron does not give his authority for the Spanish original
of his _Romance Muy Doloroso_. In default of any definite information,
it may be surmised that his fancy was caught by some broadside or
chap-book which chanced to come into his possession, and that he made
his translation without troubling himself about the origin or
composition of the ballad. As it stands, the "Romance" is a cento of
three or more ballads which are included in the _Guerras Civiles de
Granada_ of Gines Perez de Hita, published at Saragossa in 1595 (see ed.
"En Alcala de Henares," 1601, pp. 249-252). Stanzas 1-11, "Passeavase el
Rey Moro," etc., follow the text which De Hita gives as a translation
from the Arabic; stanzas 12-14 are additional, and do not correspond
with any of the Spanish originals; stanzas 15-21, with numerous
deviations and omissions, follow the text of a second ballad, "Moro
Alcayde, Moro Alcayde," described by De Hita as "antiguo Romance," and
portions of stanzas 21-23 are imbedded in a ballad entitled "Muerte dada
a Los Abencerrajes" (Duran's _Romancero General_, 1851, ii. 89).

The ballad as a whole was not known to students of Spanish literature
previous to the publication of Byron's translation (1818), (see _Ancient
Ballads from the Civil Wars of Granada_, by Thomas Rodd, 1801, pp. 93,
98; Southey's _Common-Place Book_, iv. 262-266, and his _Chronicle of
the Cid_, 1808, pp. 371-374), and it has not been included by H. Duran
in his _Romancero General_, 1851, ii. 89-91, or by F. Wolf and C.
Hofmann in their _Primavera y Flor de Romances_, 1856, i. 270-278. At
the same time, it is most improbable that Byron was his own
"Centonista," and it may be assumed that the Spanish text as printed
(see _Childe Harold,_ Canto IV., 1818, pp. 240-254, and _Poetical
Works_, 1891, pp. 566, 567) was in his possession or within his reach.
(For a correspondence on the subject, see _Notes and Queries_, Third
Series, vol. xii. p. 391, and Fourth Series, vol. i. p. 162.)

A MS. of the Spanish text, sent to England for "copy," is in a foreign
handwriting. Two MSS. (A, B) of the translation are in Mr. Murray's
possession: A, a rough draft; B, a fair copy. The watermark of A is
1808, of B (dated January 4, 1817) 1800. It is to be noted that the
refrain in the Spanish text is _Ay de mi Alhama_, and that the insertion
of the comma is a printer's or reader's error.]

[569] [In A.D. 886, during the reign of Muley Abul Hacen, King of
Granada, Albania was surprised and occupied by the Christians under Don
Rodrigo Ponce de Leon.]

[570] The effect of the original ballad--which existed both in Spanish
and Arabic--was such, that it was forbidden to be sung by the Moors, on
pain of death, within Granada. ["This ballad was so dolorous in the
original Arabic language, that every time it was sung it acted as an
incitement to grief and despair, and for this reason it was at length
finally prohibited in Granada."--_Historia ... de las Guerras Civiles_,
translated from the Arabic of Abenhamim, by Gines Perez de Hita, and
from the Spanish by Thomas Rodd, 1803, p. 334. According to Ticknor
(_Hist. of Spanish Literature_, 1888, iii. 139), the "Arabic origin" of
De Hita's work is not at all probable. "He may have obtained Arabic
materials for parts of his story."]

[hv] _Alas--alas--Alhama!_--[MS. M.]

[571] [Byron's _Ay de mi, Alhama_, which should be printed _Ay de mi
Alhama_, must be rendered "Woe for my Alhama!" "Woe is me, Alhama!" is
the equivalent of "_Ay de mi Alhama!_"]

[572] {531}["Un viejo Alfaqui" is "an old Alfaqui," _i.e._ a doctor of
the Mussulman law, not a proper name.]

[573] {532}["De leyes tambien hablava" should be rendered "He spake
'also' of the laws," not _tan bien_, "so well," or "exceeding well."]

[574] {533}[The Alcaide or "governor" of the original ballad is
converted into the Alfaqui of stanza 9. It was the "Alcaide," in whose
absence Alhama was taken, and who lost children, wife, honour, and his
own head in consequence (_Notes and Queries_, iv. i. 162).]

[575] {535}[Jacopo Vittorelli (1749-1835) was born at Bassano, in
Venetian territory. Under the Napoleonic "kingdom of Italy" he held
office as a subordinate in the Ministry of Education at Milan, and was
elected a member of the college of "Dotti." At a later period of his
life he returned to Bassano, and received an appointment as censor of
the press. His poetry, which is sweet and musical, but lacking in force
and substance, recalls and embodies the style and spirit of the dying
literature of the eighteenth century. "He lived and died," says Luigi
Carrer, "the poet of Irene and Dori," unmoved by the hopes and fears,
the storms and passions, of national change and development.--See
_Manuale della Letteratura Italiana_, by A. d'Ancona and O. Bacci, 1894,
iv. 585.]

[576] {536}["The Helen of Canova (a bust which is in the house of Madame
the Countess d'Albrizzi, whom I know) is without exception, to my mind,
the most perfectly beautiful of human conceptions, and far beyond my
ideas of human execution,"--Letter to Murray, November 25, 1816. In the
works of Antonio Canova, engraved in outline by Henry Moses (London,
1873), the bust of Helen is figured (to face p. 58), and it is stated
that it was executed in 1814, and presented to the Countess Albrizzi.

[578] {538}["The mumming closed with a masked ball at the Fenice, where
I went, as also to most of the ridottos, etc., etc.; and, though I did
not dissipate much upon the whole, yet I find 'the sword wearing out the
scabbard,' though I have but just turned the corner of
twenty-nine."--Letter to Moore, February 28, 1817. The verses form part
of the letter. (See _Letters_, 1900, iv. 59, 60.)]

[579] [Lady Blessington told Crabb Robinson (Diary, 1869, in. 17) that
the publication of the _Question and Answer_ would "kill Rogers." The
MS. is dated 1818, and it is probable that the lines were written in the
early spring of that year. Moore or Murray had told Byron that Rogers
was in doubt whether to praise or blame him in his poem on "Human Life"
now approaching completion; and he had heard, from other sources, that
it was Rogers who was the author or retailer of certain scandalous
stories which were current in the "whispering-gallery of the world." He
had reason to believe that everybody was talking about him, and it was a
relief to be able to catch and punish so eminent a scandal-monger. It
was in this spirit that he wrote to Murray (February 20, 1818), "What
you tell me of Rogers, ... is like him. He cannot say that I have not
been a sincere and warm friend to him, till the black drop of his liver
oozed through too palpably to be overlooked. Now if I once catch him at
any of his jugglery with me or mine, let him look to it," etc., etc.,
and in all probability the "poem on Rogers" was then in existence, or
was working in his brain. The lines once written, Byron swallowed his
venom, and, when Rogers visited Italy in the autumn of 1821, he met him
at Bologna, travelled with him across the Apennines to Florence, and
invited him "to stay as long as he liked" at Pisa. Thither Rogers came,
presumably, in November, 1821, and, if we may trust the _Table Talk_
(1856, p. 238), remained at the Palazzo Lanfranchi for several days.

Byron seems to have been more than usually provocative and
cross-grained, and, on one occasion (see Medwin, _Angler in Wales_,
1834, i. 26, _sq_.; and _Records of Shelley, etc_., by E. T. Trelawney,
1878, i. 53), when he was playing billiards, and Rogers was in the lobby
outside, secretly incited his bull-dog, "Faithful Moretto," to bark and
show his teeth; and, when Medwin had convoyed the terror-stricken bard
into his presence, greeted him with effusion, but contrived that he
should sit down on the very sofa which hid from view the MS. of
"Question and Answer." _Longa est injuria, longae ambages_; but the story
rests on the evidence of independent witnesses.

By far the best comment on satire and satirist is to be found in the
noble lines in _Italy_, in which Rogers commemorates his last meeting
with the "Youth who swam from Sestos to Abydos"--

                          "If imagined wrongs
    Pursued thee, urging thee sometimes to do
    Things long regretted, oft, as many know,
    None more than I, thy gratitude would build
    On slight foundations; and, if in thy life
    Not happy, in thy death thou surely wert,
    Thy wish accomplished."

[583] [Addressed to Miss Chaworth, in allusion to a duel fought between
two of their ancestors, D[ominus] B[yron] and Mr. C., January 26, 1765.

Byron and Mary Anne Chaworth were fourth cousins, both being fifth in
descent from George, Viscount Chaworth, whose daughter Elizabeth was
married to William, third Lord Byron (d. 1695), the poet's
great-great-grandfather. The duel between their grand-uncles, William,
fifth Lord Byron, and William Chaworth, Esq., of Annesley, was fought
between eight and nine o'clock in the evening of Saturday, January 26,
1765 (see _The Gazetteer_, Monday, January 28, 1765), at the Star and
Garter Tavern, Pall Mall. The coroner's jury brought in a verdict of
wilful murder (see for the "Inquisition," and report of trial, _Journals
of the House of Lords_, 1765, pp. 49, 126-135), and on the presentation
of their testimony to the House of Lords, Byron pleaded for a trial "by
God and his peers," whereupon he was arrested and sent to the Tower. The
case was tried by the Lords Temporal (the Lords Spiritual asked
permission to withdraw), and, after a defence had been read by the
prisoner, 119 peers brought in a verdict of "Not guilty of murder,
guilty of manslaughter, on my honour." Four peers only returned a
verdict of "Not guilty." The result of this verdict was that Lord Byron
claimed the benefit of the statute of Edward VI., and was discharged on
paying the fees.

The defence, which is given in full (see Journal, etc., for April 17,
1765), is able and convincing. Whilst maintaining an air of chivalry and
candour, the accused contrived to throw the onus of criminality on his
antagonist. It was Mr. Chaworth who began the quarrel, by sneering at
his cousin's absurd and disastrous leniency towards poachers. It was
Chaworth who insisted on an interview, not on the stairs, but in a
private room, who locked the door, and whose demeanour made a challenge
"to draw" inevitable. The room was dimly lit, and when the table was
pushed back, the space for the combatants was but twelve feet by five.
After two thrusts had been parried, and Lord Byron's shirt had been
torn, he shifted a little to the right, to take advantage of such light
as there was, came to close quarters with his adversary and, "as he
supposed, gave the unlucky wound which he would ever reflect upon with
the utmost regret."

If there was any truth in his plea, the "wicked Lord Byron" has been
misjudged, and, at least in the matter of the duel, was not so black as
he has been painted. For Byron's defence of his grand-uncle, see letter
to M. J. J. Coulmann, Genoa, July 12, 1823, _Life_, by Karl Elze, 1872,
pp. 443-446.]

[584] {543}[In the coroner's "Inquisition," the sword is described as
being "made of iron and steel, of the value of five shillings." Byron
says that "so far from feeling any remorse for having killed Mr.
Chaworth, who was a fire-eater (_spadassin_), ... he always kept the
sword ... in his bed-chamber, where it still was when he
died."--_Ibid._, p. 445.]

[585] [Ralph de Burun held Horestan Castle and other manors from the
Conqueror. Byron's mother was descended from James I. of Scotland.]

_et sq._]

[587] [From an autograph MS. in the possession of Mr. Murray, now for
the first time printed.]

[588] {545} [There has been some misunderstanding with regard to this
poem. According to the statement of the Countess Guiccioli (see _Works
of Lord Byron_, ed. 1832, xii. 14), "Stanzas to the Po" were composed
about the middle of April, 1819, "while Lord Byron was actually sailing
on the Po," _en route_ from Venice to Ravenna. Medwin, who was the first
to publish the lines (_Conversations, etc._, 1824, 410, pp. 24-26), says
that they were written when Byron was about to "quit Venice to join" the
Countess at Ravenna, and, in a footnote, explains that the river
referred to is the Po. Now, if the Countess and Medwin (and Moore, who
follows Medwin, _Life_, p. 396) are right, and the river is the Po, the
"ancient walls" Ravenna, and the "Lady of the land" the Guiccioli, the
stanzas may have been written in June (not April), 1819, possibly at
Ferrara, and the river must be the Po di Primaro. Even so, the first
line of the first stanza and the third and fourth lines of the ninth
stanza require explanation. The Po does not "roll by the ancient walls"
of Ravenna; and how could Byron be at one and the same time "by the
source" (stanza 9, line 4), and sailing on the river, or on some
canalized tributary or effluent? Be the explanation what it may--and it
is possible that the lines were _not_ originally designed for the
Countess, but for another "Lady of the land" (see letter to Murray, May
18, 1819)--it may be surmised that "the lines written last year on
crossing the Po," the "mere verses of society," which were given to
Kinnaird (see letter to Murray, May 8, 1820, and _Conversations of Lord
Byron with Lady Blessington_, 1834, p. 143), were not the sombre though
passionate elegy, "River, that rollest," but the bitter and somewhat
cynical rhymes, "Could Love for ever, Run like a river" (_vide post_, p.
549).]

Fitzgerald and his sisters Pamela and Lucy to their blood," July 13,

[591] {549}["A friend of Lord Byron's, who was with him at Ravenna when
he wrote these stanzas, says, They were composed, like many others, with
no view of publication, but merely to relieve himself in a moment of
suffering. He had been painfully excited by some circumstances which
appeared to make it necessary that he should immediately quit Italy; and
in the day and the hour that he wrote the song was labouring under an
access of fever" (_Works_, 1832, xii. 317, note 1). Here, too, there is
some confusion of dates and places. Byron was at Venice, not at Ravenna,
December 1, 1819, when these lines were composed. They were sent, as
Lady Blessington testifies, to Kinnaird, and are probably identical with
the "mere verses of society," mentioned in the letter to Murray of May
8, 1820. The last stanza reflects the mood of a letter to the Countess
Guiccioli, dated November 25 (1819), "I go to save you, and leave a
country insupportable to me without you" (_Letters_, 1900, iv. 379, note
2).]

1901, v. 364.]

[592] [A few days before Byron enclosed these lines in a letter to Moore
(September 17, 1821) he had written to Murray (September 12): "If ever I
_do_ return to England ... I will write a poem to which _English Bards,
etc._, shall be New Milk, in comparison. Your present literary world of
mountebanks stands in need of such an Avatar." Hence the somewhat
ambiguous title. The word "Avatar" is not only applied ironically to
George IV. as the "Messiah of Royalty," but metaphorically to the poem,
which would descend in the "Capacity of Preserver" (see Sir W. Jones,
_Asiatic Research_, i. 234).

The "fury" which sent Byron into this "lawless conscription of
rhythmus," was inspired partly by an ungenerous attack on Moore, which
appeared in the pages of _John Bull_ ("Thomas Moore is not likely to
fall in the way of knighthood ... being public defaulter in his office
to a large amount.... [August 5]. It is true that we cannot from
principle esteem the writer of the _Twopenny Postbag_.... It is equally
true that we shrink from the profligacy," etc., August 12, 1821); and,
partly, by the servility of the Irish, who had welcomed George IV. with
an outburst of enthusiastic loyalty, when he entered Dublin in triumph
within ten days of the death of Queen Caroline. The _Morning Chronicle_,
August 8-August 18, 1821, prints effusive leading articles, edged with
black borders, on the Queen's illness, death, funeral procession, etc.,
over against a column (in small type) headed "The King in Dublin."
Byron's satire is a running comment on the pages of the _Morning
Chronicle_. Moore was in Paris at the time, being, as _John Bull_ said,
"obliged to live out of England," and Byron gave him directions that
twenty copies of the _Irish Avatar_ "should be carefully and privately
printed off." Medwin says that Byron gave him "a printed copy," but his
version (see _Conversations_, 1824, pp. 332-338), doubtless for
prudential reasons, omits twelve of the more libellous stanzas. The poem
as a whole was not published in England till 1831, when "George the
despised" was gone to his account. According to Crabb Robinson (_Diary_,
1869, ii. 437), Goethe said that "Byron's verses on George IV. (_Query?
The Irish Avatar_) were the sublime of hatred."]

Spartan foe, and thrice he offered the Hekatomphonia on Mount Ithome.
His name was held in honour long after "the rowers on their benches"
heard the wail, "Pan, Pan is dead!" At the close of the second century
of the Christian era, Pausanias (iv. 16. 4) made a note of Messenian
maidens hymning his victory over the Lacedaemonians--

Appendix III. p. 574), and with Mitford's _Greece_ (_Don Juan_, Canto
XII. stanza xix. line 7). Hence his knowledge of Aristomenes. The
thought expressed in lines 5-11 was, possibly, suggested by Coleridge's
translation of the famous passage in Schiller's _Piccolomini_ (act ii.

                             THE BLUES:

                          A LITERARY ECLOGUE.

    "Nimium ne crede colori."--Virgil, [_Ecl_. ii. 17]

O trust not, ye beautiful creatures, to hue,
Though your _hair_ were as _red_, as your _stockings_ are _blue_.





                       INTRODUCTION TO _THE BLUES_.


Byron's correspondence does not explain the mood in which he wrote _The
Blues_, or afford the slightest hint or clue to its _motif_ or occasion.
In a letter to Murray, dated Ravenna, August 7, 1821, he writes, "I send
you a thing which I scribbled off yesterday, a mere buffoonery, to quiz
'The Blues.' If published it must be _anonymously_.... You may send me a
proof if you think it worth the trouble." Six weeks later, September 20,
he had changed his mind. "You need not," he says, "send _The Blues_,
which is a mere buffoonery not meant for publication." With these
intimations our knowledge ends, and there is nothing to show why in
August, 1821, he took it into his head "to quiz The Blues," or why,
being so minded, he thought it worth while to quiz them in so pointless
and belated a fashion. We can but guess that an allusion in a letter
from England, an incident at a conversazione at Ravenna, or perhaps the
dialogues in Peacock's novels, _Melincourt_ and _Nightmare Abbey_,
brought to his recollection the half-modish, half-literary coteries of
the earlier years of the Regency, and that he sketches the scenes and
persons of his eclogue not from life, but from memory.

In the Diary of 1813, 1814, there is more than one mention of the
"Blues." For instance, November 27, 1813, he writes, "Sotheby is a
_Litterateur_, the oracle of the Coteries of the * *'s, Lydia White
(Sydney Smith's 'Tory Virgin'), Mrs. Wilmot (she, at least, is a swan,
and might frequent a purer stream), Lady Beaumont and all the Blues,
with Lady Charlemont at their head." Again on December 1, "To-morrow
there is a party _purple_ at the 'blue' Miss Berry's. Shall I go? um!--I
don't much affect your blue-bottles;--but one ought to be civil....
Perhaps that blue-winged Kashmirian butterfly of book-learning Lady
Charlemont will be there" (see _Letters_, 1898, ii. 333, 358, note 2).

Byron was, perhaps, a more willing guest at literary entertainments
than he professed to be. "I met him," says Sir Walter Scott (_Memoirs of
the Life, etc._, 1838, ii. 167), "frequently in society.... Some very
agreeable parties I can recollect, particularly one at Sir George
Beaumont's, where the amiable landlord had assembled some persons
distinguished for talent. Of these I need only mention the late Sir
Humphry Davy.... Mr. Richard Sharpe and Mr. Rogers were also present."

Again, Miss Berry, in her _Journal_ (1866, in. 49) records, May 8, 1815,
that "Lord and Lady Byron persuaded me to go with them to Miss [Lydia]
White (_vide post_, p. 587). Never have I seen a more imposing
convocation of ladies arranged in a circle than when we entered ... Lord
Byron brought me home. He stayed to supper." If he did not affect "your
blue-bottles," he was on intimate terms with Madame de Stael, "the
_Begum_ of Literature," as Moore called her; with the Contessa
d'Albrizzi (the De Stael of Italy); with Mrs. Wilmot, the inspirer of
"She walks in beauty like the night;" with Mrs. Shelley; with Lady
Blessington. Moreover, to say nothing of his "mathematical wife," who
was as "blue as ether," the Countess Guiccioli could not only read and
"inwardly digest" _Corinna_ (see letter to Moore, January 2, 1820), but
knew the _Divina Commedia_ by heart, and was a critic as well as an
inspirer of her lover's poetry.

If it is difficult to assign a reason or occasion for the composition of
_The Blues_, it is a harder, perhaps an impossible, task to identify all
the _dramatis personae_. Botherby, Lady Bluemount, and Miss Diddle are,
obviously, Sotheby, Lady Beaumont, and Lydia White. Scamp the Lecturer
may be Hazlitt, who had incurred Byron's displeasure by commenting on
his various and varying estimates of Napoleon (see _Lectures on the
English Poets_, 1818, p. 304, and _Don Juan_, Canto 1. stanza ii. line
7, note to Buonaparte). Inkel seems to be meant for Byron himself, and
Tracy, a friend, _not_ a Lake poet, for Moore. Sir Richard and Lady
Bluebottle may possibly symbolize Lord and Lady Holland; and Miss Lilac
is, certainly, Miss Milbanke, the "Annabella" of Byron's courtship, not
the "moral Clytemnestra" of his marriage and separation.

_The Blues_ was published anonymously in the third number of the
_Liberal_, which appeared April 26, 1823. The "Eclogue" was not
attributed to Byron, and met with greater contempt than it deserved. In
the _Noctes Ambrosiance_ (Blackwood's _Edinburgh Magazine_, May, 1823,
vol. xiii. p. 607), the third number of the _Liberal_ is dismissed with
the remark, "The last Number contains not one _line_ of Byron's! Thank
God! he has seen his error, and kicked them out." Brief but contemptuous
notices appeared in the _Literary Chronicle_, April 26, and the
_Literary Gazette_, May 3, 1823; while a short-lived periodical, named
the _Literary Register_ (May 3, quoted at length in _John Bull_, May 4,
1823), implies that the author (i.e. Leigh Hunt) would be better
qualified to "catch the manners" of Lisson Grove than of May Fair. It is
possible that this was the "last straw," and that the reception of _The
Blues_ hastened Byron's determination to part company with the
profitless and ill-omened _Liberal_.




                             THE BLUES:[609]

                           A LITERARY ECLOGUE.




                            ECLOGUE THE FIRST.

              _London.--Before the Door of a Lecture Room_.

                     _Enter_ TRACY, _meeting_ INKEL.

    _Ink_. You're too late.

    _Tra_.                  Is it over?

    _Ink_.                              Nor will be this hour.
    But the benches are crammed, like a garden in flower.
    With the pride of our belles, who have made it the fashion;
    So, instead of "beaux arts," we may say "la _belle_ passion"
    For learning, which lately has taken the lead in
    The world, and set all the fine gentlemen reading.

    _Tra_. I know it too well, and have worn out my patience
    With studying to study your new publications.
    There's Vamp, Scamp, and Mouthy, and Wordswords and Co.[610]
    With their damnable----

    _Ink_.                  Hold, my good friend, do you know           10
    Whom you speak to?

    _Tra_.            Right well, boy, and so does "the Row:"[611]
    You're an author--a poet--

    _Ink_.                     And think you that I
    Can stand tamely in silence, to hear you decry
    The Muses?

    _Tra_.    Excuse me: I meant no offence
    To the Nine; though the number who make some pretence
    To their favours is such----but the subject to drop,
    I am just piping hot from a publisher's shop,
    (Next door to the pastry-cook's; so that when I
    Cannot find the new volume I wanted to buy
    On the bibliopole's shelves, it is only two paces,                  20
    As one finds every author in one of those places:)
    Where I just had been skimming a charming critique,
    So studded with wit, and so sprinkled with Greek!
    Where your friend--you know who--has just got such a threshing,
    That it is, as the phrase goes, extremely "_refreshing._"[612]
    What a beautiful word!

    _Ink_.                Very true; 'tis so soft
    And so cooling--they use it a little too oft;
    And the papers have got it at last--but no matter.
    So they've cut up our friend then?

    _Tra_.                            Not left him a tatter--
    Not a rag of his present or past reputation,                        30
    Which they call a disgrace to the age, and the nation.

    _Ink_. I'm sorry to hear this! for friendship, you know--
    Our poor friend!--but I thought it would terminate so.
    Our friendship is such, I'll read nothing to shock it.
    You don't happen to have the Review in your pocket?

    _Tra_. No; I left a round dozen of authors and others
    (Very sorry, no doubt, since the cause is a brother's)
    All scrambling and jostling, like so many imps,
    And on fire with impatience to get the next glimpse.

    _Ink_. Let us join them.

    _Tra_.                  What, won't you return to the lecture?      40

    _Ink_. Why the place is so crammed, there's not room for a spectre.
    Besides, our friend Scamp is to-day so absurd--[613]

    _Tra_. How can you know that till you hear him?

    _Ink_.                                          I heard
    Quite enough; and, to tell you the truth, my retreat
    Was from his vile nonsense, no less than the heat.

    _Tra_. I have had no great loss then?

    _Ink_.                                Loss!--such a palaver!
    I'd inoculate sooner my wife with the slaver
    Of a dog when gone rabid, than listen two hours
    To the torrent of trash which around him he pours,
    Pumped up with such effort, disgorged with such labour,             50
    That----come--do not make me speak ill of one's neighbour.

    _Tra_. _I_ make you!

    _Ink_.                   Yes, you! I said nothing until
    You compelled me, by speaking the truth----

    _Tra_.                               _To speak ill?_
    Is that your deduction?

    _Ink_.                 When speaking of Scamp ill,
    I certainly _follow, not set_ an example.
    The fellow's a fool, an impostor, a zany.

    _Tra_. And the crowd of to-day shows that one fool makes many.
    But we two will be wise.

    _Ink_.                  Pray, then, let us retire.

    _Tra_. I would, but----

    _Ink_.                There must be attraction much higher
    Than Scamp, or the Jew's harp he nicknames his lyre,                60
    To call you to this hotbed.

    _Tra_.                     I own it--'tis true--
    A fair lady----

    _Ink_.       A spinster?

    _Tra_.                  Miss Lilac.

    _Ink_.                               The Blue!

    _Tra_. The heiress! The angel!

    _Ink_.                         The devil! why, man,
    Pray get out of this hobble as fast as you can.
    _You_ wed with Miss Lilac! 'twould be your perdition:
    She's a poet, a chymist, a mathematician.[614]

    _Tra_. I say she's an angel.

    _Ink_.                      Say rather an angle.
    If you and she marry, you'll certainly wrangle.
    I say she's a Blue, man, as blue as the ether.

    _Tra_. And is that any cause for not coming together?               70

    _Ink_. Humph! I can't say I know any happy alliance
    Which has lately sprung up from a wedlock with science.
    She's so learned in all things, and fond of concerning
    Herself in all matters connected with learning,
    That----

    _Tra_.  What?

    _Ink_.        I perhaps may as well hold my tongue;
    But there's five hundred people can tell you you're
    wrong.

    _Tra_. You forget Lady Lilac's as rich as a Jew.

    _Ink_. Is it miss or the cash of mamma you pursue?

    _Tra_. Why, Jack, I'll be frank with you--something of both.
    The girl's a fine girl.

    _Ink_.                 And you feel nothing loth                    80
    To her good lady-mother's reversion; and yet
    Her life is as good as your own, I will bet.

    _Tra_. Let her live, and as long as she likes; I demand
    Nothing more than the heart of her daughter and hand.

    _Ink_. Why, that heart's in the inkstand--that hand on the pen.

    _Tra_. A propos--Will you write me a song now and then?

    _Ink_. To what purpose?

    _Tra_.                 You know, my dear friend, that in prose
    My talent is decent, as far as it goes;
    But in rhyme----

    _Ink_.         You're a terrible stick, to be sure.

    _Tra_. I own it; and yet, in these times, there's no lure           90
    For the heart of the fair like a stanza or two;
    And so, as I can't, will you furnish a few?

    _Ink_. In your name?

    _Tra_.               In my name. I will copy them out,
    To slip into her hand at the very next rout.

    _Ink_. Are you so far advanced as to hazard this?

    _Tra_.                                            Why,
    Do you think me subdued by a Blue-stocking's eye,
    So far as to tremble to tell her in rhyme
    What I've told her in prose, at the least, as sublime?

    _Ink_. _As sublime!_ If i be so, no need of my Muse.

    _Tra_. But consider, dear Inkel, she's one of the "Blues."100

    _Ink_. As sublime!--Mr. Tracy--I've nothing to say.
    Stick to prose--As sublime!!--but I wish you good day.

    _Tra_. Nay, stay, my dear fellow--consider--I'm wrong;
    I own it; but, prithee, compose me the song.

    _Ink_. _As_ sublime!!

    _Tra_.                 I but used the expression in haste.

    _Ink_. That may be, Mr. Tracy, but shows damned bad taste.

    _Tra_. I own it, I know it, acknowledge it--what
    Can I say to you more?

    _Ink_.                 I see what you'd be at:
    You disparage my parts with insidious abuse,
    Till you think you can turn them best to your own use.             110

    _Tra_. And is that not a sign I respect them?

    _Ink_.                                        Why that
    To be sure makes a difference.

    _Tra_.                        I know what is what:
    And you, who're a man of the gay world, no less
    Than a poet of t'other, may easily guess
    That I never could mean, by a word, to offend
    A genius like you, and, moreover, my friend.

    _Ink_. No doubt; you by this time should know what is due
    To a man of----but come--let us shake hands.

    _Tra_.                                      You knew,
    And you _know_, my dear fellow, how heartily I,
    Whatever you publish, am ready to buy.                             120

    _Ink_. That's my bookseller's business; I care not for sale;
    Indeed the best poems at first rather fail.
    There were Renegade's epics, and Botherby's plays,[615]
    And my own grand romance--

    _Tra_.                     Had its full share of praise.
    I myself saw it puffed in the "Old Girl's Review."[616]

    _Ink_. What Review?

    _Tra_.              Tis the English "Journal de Trevoux;"[617]
    A clerical work of our Jesuits at home.
    Have you never yet seen it?

    _Ink_.                     That pleasure's to come.

    _Tra_. Make haste then.

    _Ink_.                  Why so?

    _Tra_.                         I have heard people say
    That it threatened to give up the _ghost_ t'other day.[618]        130

    _Ink_. Well, that is a sign of some _spirit_.

    _Tra_.                                            No doubt.
    Shall you be at the Countess of Fiddlecome's rout?

    _Ink_. I've a card, and shall go: but at present, as soon
    As friend Scamp shall be pleased to step down from the moon,
    (Where he seems to be soaring in search of his wits),
    And an interval grants from his lecturing fits,
    I'm engaged to the Lady Bluebottle's collation,
    To partake of a luncheon and learn'd conversation:
    'Tis a sort of reunion for Scamp, on the days
    Of his lecture, to treat him with cold tongue and praise.          140
    And I own, for my own part, that 'tis not unpleasant.
    Will you go? There's Miss Lilac will also be present.

    _Tra_. That "metal's attractive."

    _Ink_.                           No doubt--to the pocket.

    _Tra_. You should rather encourage my passion than shock it.
    But let us proceed; for I think by the hum----

    _Ink_. Very true; let us go, then, before they can come,
    Or else we'll be kept here an hour at their levee,
    On the rack of cross questions, by all the blue bevy.
    Hark! Zounds, they'll be on us; I know by the drone
    Of old Botherby's spouting ex-cathedra tone.[619]                  150
    Aye! there he is at it. Poor Scamp! better join
    Your friends, or he'll pay you back in your own coin.

    _Tra_. All fair; 'tis but lecture for lecture.

    _Ink_.                                         That's clear.
    But for God's sake let's go, or the Bore will be here.
    Come, come: nay, I'm off.
                                                            [_Exit_ INKEL.

    _Tra_.                     You are right, and I'll follow;
    'Tis high time for a "_Sic me servavit Apollo_."[620]
    And yet we shall have the whole crew on our kibes,[621]
    Blues, dandies, and dowagers, and second-hand scribes,
    All flocking to moisten their exquisite throttles
    With a glass of Madeira[622] at Lady Bluebottle's.                 160
                                                            [_Exit_ TRACY.




                           ECLOGUE THE SECOND.

   _An Apartment in the House of_ LADY BLUEBOTTLE.--_A Table prepared._

                     SIR RICHARD BLUEBOTTLE _solus_.

    Was there ever a man who was married so sorry?
    Like a fool, I must needs do the thing in a hurry.
    My life is reversed, and my quiet destroyed;
    My days, which once passed in so gentle a void,
    Must now, every hour of the twelve, be employed;
    The twelve, do I say?--of the whole twenty-four,
    Is there one which I dare call my own any more?
    What with driving and visiting, dancing and dining,
    What with learning, and teaching, and scribbling, and shining,
    In science and art, I'll be cursed if I know                        10
    Myself from my wife; for although we are two,
    Yet she somehow contrives that all things shall be done
    In a style which proclaims us eternally one.
    But the thing of all things which distresses me more
    Than the bills of the week (though they trouble me sore)
    Is the numerous, humorous, backbiting crew
    Of scribblers, wits, lecturers, white, black, and blue,
    Who are brought to my house as an inn, to my cost--
    For the bill here, it seems, is defrayed by the host--
    No pleasure! no leisure! no thought for my pains,                   20
    But to hear a vile jargon which addles my brains;
    A smatter and chatter, gleaned out of reviews,
    By the rag, tag, and bobtail, of those they call "Blues;"
    A rabble who know not----But soft, here they come!
    Would to God I were deaf! as I'm not, I'll be dumb.

    _Enter_ LADY BLUEBOTTLE, MISS LILAC, LADY BLUEMOUNT, MR. BOTHERBY,
   INKEL, TRACY, MISS MAZARINE, _and others, with_ SCAMP _the Lecturer,
                               etc., etc._

    _Lady Blueb_.
    Ah! Sir Richard, good morning: I've brought you some friends.

    _Sir Rich_. (_bows, and afterwards aside_).
    If friends, they're the first.

    _Lady Blueb_.                 But the luncheon attends.
    I pray ye be seated, "_sans ceremonie_."
    Mr. Scamp, you're fatigued; take your chair there, next me.
                                                          [_They all sit._

    _Sir Rich_. (_aside_). If he does, his fatigue is to come.

    _Lady Blueb_.                                             Mr. Tracy--
    Lady Bluemount--Miss Lilac--be pleased, pray, to place ye;          31
    And you, Mr. Botherby--

    _Both_.                 Oh, my dear Lady,
    I obey.

    _Lady Blueb_. Mr. Inkel, I ought to upbraid ye:
    You were not at the lecture.

    _Ink_.                      Excuse me, I was;
    But the heat forced me out in the best part--alas!
    And when--

    _Lady Blueb_. To be sure it was broiling; but then
    You have lost such a lecture!

    _Both_.                      The best of the ten.

    _Tra_. How can you know that? there are two more.

    _Both_.                                          Because
    I defy him to beat this day's wondrous applause.
    The very walls shook.

    _Ink_.               Oh, if that be the test,                       40
    I allow our friend Scamp has this day done his best.
    Miss Lilac, permit me to help you;--a wing?

    _Miss Lil_. No more, sir, I thank you. Who lectures next spring?

    _Both_. Dick Dunder.

    _Ink_.               That is, if he lives.

    _Miss Lil_.                               And why not?

    _Ink_. No reason whatever, save that he's a sot.
    Lady Bluemount! a glass of Madeira?

    _Lady Bluem_.                      With pleasure.

    _Ink_. How does your friend Wordswords, that Windermere treasure?
    Does he stick to his lakes, like the leeches he sings,[623]
    And their gatherers, as Homer sung warriors and kings?

    _Lady Bluem_. He has just got a place.[624]

    _Ink_.                                 As a footman?

    _Lady Bluem_.                                       For shame!
    Nor profane with your sneers so poetic a name.                      51

    _Ink_. Nay, I meant him no evil, but pitied his master;
    For the poet of pedlers 'twere, sure, no disaster
    To wear a new livery; the more, as 'tis not
    The first time he has turned both his creed and his coat.

    _Lady Bluem_. For shame! I repeat. If Sir George could but hear--

    _Lady Blueb_. Never mind our friend Inkel; we all know, my dear,
    'Tis his way.

    _Sir Rich_.    But this place--

    _Ink_.                          Is perhaps like friend Scamp's,
    A lecturer's.

    _Lady Bluem_. Excuse me--'tis one in the "Stamps:"
    He is made a collector.

    _Tra_.                 Collector!

    _Sir Rich_.                       How?

    _Miss Lil_.                            What?                        60

    _Ink_. I shall think of him oft when I buy a new hat:
    There his works will appear--

    _Lady Bluem_.                Sir, they reach to the Ganges.

    _Ink_. I sha'n't go so far--I can have them at Grange's.[625]

    _Lady Bluem_. Oh fie!

    _Miss Lil_.          And for shame!

    _Lady Bluem_.                      You're too bad.

    _Both_.                                           Very good!

    _Lady Bluem_. How good?

    _Lady Blueb_.          He means nought--'tis his phrase.

    _Lady Bluem_.                                          He grows rude.

    _Lady Blueb_. He means nothing; nay, ask him.

    _Lady Bluem_.                                Pray, Sir! did you mean
    What you say?

    _Ink_.        Never mind if he did; 'twill be seen
    That whatever he means won't alloy what he says.

    _Both_. Sir!

    _Ink_.      Pray be content with your portion of praise;
    'Twas in your defence.

    _Both_.               If you please, with submission                70
    I can make out my own.

    _Ink_.                 It would be your perdition.
    While you live, my dear Botherby, never defend
    Yourself or your works; but leave both to a friend.
    Apropos--Is your play then accepted at last?

    _Both_. At last?

    _Ink_. Why I thought--that's to say--there had passed
    A few green-room whispers, which hinted,--you know
    That the taste of the actors at best is so so.[626]

    _Both_. Sir, the green-room's in rapture, and so's the Committee.

    _Ink_. Aye--yours are the plays for exciting our "pity
    And fear," as the Greek says: for "purging the mind,"80
    I doubt if you'll leave us an equal behind.

    _Both_. I have written the prologue, and meant to have prayed
    For a spice of your wit in an epilogue's aid.

    _Ink_. Well, time enough yet, when the play's to be played.
    Is it cast yet?

    _Both_.         The actors are fighting for parts,
    As is usual in that most litigious of arts.

    _Lady Blueb_. We'll all make a party, and go the _first_ night.

    _Tra_. And you promised the epilogue, Inkel.

    _Ink_.                                       Not quite.
    However, to save my friend Botherby trouble,
    I'll do what I can, though my pains must be double.                 90

    _Tra_. Why so?

    _Ink_.          To do justice to what goes before.

    _Both_. Sir, I'm happy to say, I've no fears on that score.
    Your parts, Mr. Inkel, are----

    _Ink_.                    Never mind _mine_;
    Stick to those of your play, which is quite your own line.

    _Lady Bluem_. You're a fugitive writer, I think, sir, of rhymes?[627]

    _Ink_. Yes, ma'am; and a fugitive reader sometimes.
    On Wordswords, for instance, I seldom alight,
    Or on Mouthey, his friend, without taking to flight.

    _Lady Bluem_. Sir, your taste is too common; but time and posterity
    Will right these great men, and this age's severity                100
    Become its reproach.

    _Ink_.               I've no sort of objection,
    So I'm not of the party to take the infection.

    _Lady Blueb_. Perhaps you have doubts that they ever will _take_?

    _Ink_. Not at all; on the contrary, those of the lake
    Have taken already, and still will continue
    To take--what they can, from a groat to a guinea,
    Of pension or place;--but the subject's a bore.

    _Lady Bluem_. Well, sir, the time's coming.

    _Ink_.                                   Scamp! don't you feel sore?
    What say you to this?

    _Scamp_.             They have merit, I own;
    Though their system's absurdity keeps it unknown,                  110

    _Ink_. Then why not unearth it in one of your lectures?

    _Scamp_. It is only time past which comes under my strictures.

    _Lady Blueb_. Come, a truce with all tartness;--the joy of my heart
    Is to see Nature's triumph o'er all that is art.
    Wild Nature!--Grand Shakespeare!

    _Both_.                         And down Aristotle!

    _Lady Bluem_. Sir George[628] thinks exactly with Lady Bluebottle:
    And my Lord Seventy-four,[629] who protects our dear Bard,
    And who gave him his place, has the greatest regard
    For the poet, who, singing of pedlers and asses,
    Has found out the way to dispense with Parnassus.                  120

    _Tra_. And you, Scamp!--

    _Scamp_.                I needs must confess I'm embarrassed.

    _Ink_. Don't call upon Scamp, who's already so harassed
    With old _schools_, and new _schools_,
                             and no _schools_, and all _schools_[630].

    _Tra_. Well, one thing is certain, that _some_ must be fools.
    I should like to know who.

    _Ink_.                   And I should not be sorry
    To know who are _not_:--it would save us some worry.

    _Lady Blueb_. A truce with remark, and let nothing control
    This "feast of our reason, and flow of the soul."
    Oh! my dear Mr. Botherby! sympathise!--I
    Now feel such a rapture, I'm ready to fly,                         130
    I feel so elastic--"_so buoyant--so buoyant!_"[631]

    _Ink_. Tracy! open the window.

    _Tra_.                         I wish her much joy on't.

    _Both_. For God's sake, my Lady Bluebottle, check not
    This gentle emotion, so seldom our lot
    Upon earth. Give it way: 'tis an impulse which lifts
    Our spirits from earth--the sublimest of gifts;
    For which poor Prometheus was chained to his mountain:
    'Tis the source of all sentiment--feeling's true fountain;
    'Tis the Vision of Heaven upon Earth: 'tis the gas
    Of the soul: 'tis the seizing of shades as they pass,              140
    And making them substance: 'tis something divine:--

    _Ink_. Shall I help you, my friend, to a little more wine?

    _Both_. I thank you: not any more, sir, till I dine.[632]

    _Ink_. Apropos--Do you dine with Sir Humphry to day?

    _Tra_. I should think with _Duke_ Humphry[633] was more in your way.

    _Ink_. It might be of yore; but we authors now look
    To the Knight, as a landlord, much more than the Duke.
    The truth is, each writer now quite at his ease is,
    And (except with his publisher) dines where he pleases.
    But 'tis now nearly five, and I must to the Park.                  150

    _Tra_. And I'll take a turn with you there till 'tis dark.
    And you, Scamp--

    _Scamp_.          Excuse me! I must to my notes,
    For my lecture next week.

    _Ink_. He must mind whom he quotes
    Out of "Elegant Extracts."

    _Lady Blueb_.             Well, now we break up;
    But remember Miss Diddle[634] invites us to sup.

    _Ink_. Then at two hours past midnight we all meet again,
    For the sciences, sandwiches, hock, and champagne!

    _Tra_. And the sweet lobster salad![635]

    _Both_.                               I honour that meal;
    For 'tis then that our feelings most genuinely--feel.

    _Ink_. True; feeling is truest _then_, far beyond question:
    I wish to the gods 'twas the same with digestion!                  161

    _Lady Blueb_. Pshaw!--never mind that; for one moment of feeling
    Is worth--God knows what.

    _Ink_.                  'Tis at least worth concealing
    For itself, or what follows--But here comes your carriage.

    _Sir Rich_. (_aside_).
    I wish all these people were d----d with _my_ marriage!
                                                                [_Exeunt._

parties at Mrs. Montague's in grey or blue worsted stockings, in lieu of
full dress. The ladies who excused and tolerated this defiance of the
conventions were nicknamed "blues," or "blue-stockings." Hannah More
describes such a club or coterie in her _Bas Bleu_, which was circulated
in MS. in 1784 (Boswell's _Life of Johnson_, 1848, p. 689). A farce by
Moore, entitled _The M. P., or The Blue-Stocking_, was played for the
first time at the Lyceum, September 30, 1811. The heroine, "Lady Bab
Blue, is a pretender to poetry, chemistry, etc."--Genest's _Hist. of the
Stage_, 1832, viii. 270.]

which Byron attended (see letter to Harness, December 6, 1811,
_Letters_, 1898, ii. 76, note 1); but the substance of the attack is
probably derived from Gifford's review of _Lectures on the English

And see "Letter to the Editor of 'My Grandmother's Review,'" _Letters_,
1900, iv. Appendix VII. pp. 465-470. The reference may be to a review of
the Fourth Canto of _Childe Harold_, which appeared in the _British
Review_, January, 1818, or to a more recent and, naturally, most hostile
notice of _Don Juan_ (No. xviii. 1819).]

[617] [_The Journal de Trevoux_, published under the title of _Memoires
de Trevoux_ (1701-1775, 265 vols. 12?), edited by members of the Society
of Jesus, was an imitation of the _Journal des Savants_. The original
matter, the Memoires, contain a mine of information for the student of
the history of French Literature; but the reviews, critical notices,
etc., to which Byron refers, were of a highly polemical and partisan
character, and were the subject of attack on the part of Protestant and
free-thinking antagonists. In a letter to Moore, dated Ravenna, June 22,
1821, Byron says, "Now, if we were but together a little to combine our
_Journal of Trevoux_!" (_Letters_, 1901, v. 309). The use of the same
illustration in letter and poem is curious and noteworthy.]

1825.]

woe," _Vision of Judgment_, stanza xc. line 4, _ante_, p. 518.]

[620] {580}["Sotheby is a good man, rhymes well (if not wisely), but is
a bore. He seizes you by the button. One night of a rout at Mrs. Hope's,
he had fastened upon me (something about Agamemnon, or Orestes, or some
of his plays), notwithstanding my symptoms of manifest distress (for I
was in love, and just nicked a minute, when neither mothers, nor
husbands, nor rivals, nor gossips, were near my then idol, who was
beautiful as the Statues of the Gallery where we stood at the
time)--Sotheby I say had seized upon me by the button and the
heart-strings, and spared neither. William Spencer, who likes fun, and
don't dislike mischief, saw my case, and coming up to us both, took me
by the hand, and pathetically bade me farewell; 'for,' said he, 'I see
it is all over with you.' Sotheby then went way. '_Sic me servavit
Apollo_.'"--_Detached Thoughts_, 1821, _Letters_, 1901, v. 433.]

entitled _The Leech-gatherer_, was written in 1802, and published in
1807.]

Westmoreland, in March, 1813. Lord Lonsdale and Sir George Beaumont were

London Directory of 1820), moved farther west some fifteen years ago.]

[626] {584}["When I belonged to the Drury Lane Committee ... the number
of plays upon the shelves were about _five_ hundred.... Mr. Sotheby
obligingly offered us all his tragedies, and I pledged myself; and,
notwithstanding many squabbles with my Committe[e]d Brethren, did get
'Ivan' accepted, read, and the parts distributed. But lo! in the very
heart of the matter, upon some _tepid_-ness on the part of Kean, or
warmth on that of the author, Sotheby withdrew his play."--_Detached
Thoughts_, 1821, _Letters_, 1901, v. 442.]

[627] [_Fugitive Pieces_ is the title of the suppressed quarto edition
of Byron's juvenile poems.]

[628] {585}[Sir George Beaumont, Bart., of Coleorton, Leicestershire
(1753-1827), landscape-painter, art critic, and picture-collector, one
of the founders of the National Gallery, married, in 1778, Margaret
Willis, granddaughter of Chief Justice Willis. She corresponded with
Wordsworth and his sister Dorothy, and with Coleridge (see _Memorials of
Coleorton_, 1888). Coleridge visited the Beaumonts for the first time at
Dunmore, in 1804. "I was not received here," he tells Wordsworth, "with
mere kindness; I was welcomed _almost_ as you welcomed me when first I
visited you at Racedown" (_Letters of S. T. Coleridge_, 1895, ii. 459).
Scott (_Memoirs of the life, etc._, 1838, ii, II) describes Sir George
Beaumont as "by far the most sensible and pleasing man I ever knew,
kind, too, in his nature, and generous and gentle in society.... He was
the great friend of Wordsworth, and understood his poetry."]

[629] [It was not Wordsworth's patron, William Lord Lonsdale, but his
kinsman James, the first earl, who, towards the close of the American
war, offered to build and man a ship of seventy-four guns.]

from each other; we are now separated. You have combined arsenic with

p. 218.]

[634] ["Lydia White," writes Lady Morgan (_Memoirs_, 1862, ii. 236),
"was a personage of much social celebrity in her day. She was an Irish
lady of large fortune and considerable talent, noted for her hospitality
and dinners in all the capitals of Europe." She is mentioned by Moore
(_Memoirs_, 1853, in. 21), Miss Berry (_Journal_, 1866, ii. 484),
Ticknor (_Life, Letters, and Journal_, 1876, i. 176), etc., etc.

Byron saw her for the last time in Venice, when she borrowed a copy of
_Lalla Rookh_ (Letter to Moore, June 1, 1818, _Letters_, 1900, iv. 237).
Sir Walter Scott, who knew her well, records her death: "January 28,
[1827]. Heard of Miss White's death--she _was_ a woman of wit, and had a
feeling and kind heart. Poor Lydia! I saw the Duke of York and her in
London, when Death, it seems, was brandishing his dart over them.

[635] [Moore, following the example of Pope, who thought his "delicious
lobster-nights" worth commemorating, gives details of a supper at
Watier's, May 19, 1814, at which Kean was present, when Byron "confined
himself to lobsters, and of these finished two or three, to his own
share," etc.--an Ambrosian night, indeed!--_Life_, p. 254.]

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

TRANSCRIBER'S NOTES

This etext is a Unicode (UTF-8) file. The main use of non-ASCII
characters is in a few phrases or lines of Greek text. Each of these is
followed by a transliteration in Beta-code, for example ?????? [tragos].
The remaining Unicode symbols are a few uses of letters a, e, s and z
with breve (curved line) above, and letters a and u with a macron
(straight line) above. In a few places, a single superscript is shown by
a caret, and two superscript letters by carets, as in J^n 10^th^.

An important feature of this edition is its copious footnotes. Footnotes
indexed with arabic numbers (as [17], [221]) are informational. Note
text in square brackets is the work of editor E. H. Coleridge.
Unbracketed note text is from earlier editions and is by a preceding
editor or Byron himself. Footnotes indexed with letters (as [c], [bf])
document variant forms of the text from manuscripts and other sources.

In the original, footnotes are printed at the foot of the page on which
they are referenced, and their indices start over on each page. Here,
footnotes are collected at the ends of each play or poem, and are
numbered consecutively throughout. Within the blocks of footnotes are
numbers in braces: {321}. These represent the page number on which
following notes originally appeared. To find a note that was originally
printed on page 27, search for {27}.

                       PREFACE TO THE FIFTH VOLUME.

The plays and poems contained in this volume were written within the
space of two years--the last two years of Byron's career as a poet. But
that was not all. Cantos VI.-XV. of _Don Juan_, _The Vision of
Judgment_, _The Blues_, _The Irish Avatar_, and other minor poems,
belong to the same period. The end was near, and, as though he had
received a warning, he hastened to make the roll complete.

Proof is impossible, but the impression remains that the greater part of
this volume has been passed over and left unread by at least two
generations of readers. Old play-goers recall Macready as "Werner," and
many persons have read _Cain_; but apart from students of literature,
readers of _Sardanapalus_ and of _The Two Foscari_ are rare; of _The Age
of Bronze_ and _The Island_ rarer still. A few of Byron's later poems
have shared the fate of Southey's epics; and, yet, with something of
Southey's persistence, Byron believed that posterity would weigh his
"regular dramas" in a fresh balance, and that his heedless critics
would kick the beam. But "can these bones live"? Can dramas which
excited the wondering admiration of Goethe and Lamartine and Sir Walter
Scott touch or lay hold of the more adventurous reader of the present
day? It is certain that even the half-forgotten works of a great and
still popular poet, which have left their mark on the creative
imagination of the poets and playwrights of three quarters of a century,
will always be studied by the few from motives of curiosity, or for
purposes of reference; but it is improbable, though not impossible, that
in the revolution of taste and sentiment, moribund or extinct poetry
will be born again into the land of the living. Poetry which has never
had its day, such as Blake's _Songs of Innocence_, the _Lyrical
Ballads_, or Fitzgerald's _Omar Khayyam_, may come, in due time, to be
recognized at its full worth; but it is a harder matter for a poem which
has lost its vogue to recapture the interest and enthusiasm of the many.

Byron is only an instance in point. Bygone poetry has little or no
attraction for modern readers. This poem or that drama may be referred
to, and occasionally examined in the interests of general culture, or in
support of a particular belief or line of conduct, as a classical or
quasi-scriptural authority; but, with the rarest exceptions, plays and
narrative poems are not read spontaneously or with any genuine
satisfaction or delight. An old-world poem which will not yield up its
secret to the idle _reader_ "of an empty day" is more or less "rudely
dismissed," without even a show of favour or hospitality.

And yet these forgotten works of the imagination are full of hidden
treasures! There is not one of Byron's "impressionist studies" of
striking episodes of history or historical legend, flung, as it were,
with a "Take it or leave it" in the face of friend or foe, which does
not transform names and shadows into persons and substance, which does
not contain lines and passages of unquestionable beauty and distinction.

But some would have it that Byron's plays, as a whole, are dull and
uninspiring, monotonous harpings on worn-out themes, which every one has
mastered or wishes to forget. A close study of the text, together with
some knowledge of the subject as it presented itself to the author and
arrested _his_ attention, may compel these impatient critics to a
different conclusion. Byron did not scruple to refer the reader to his
"sources," and was at pains to publish, in the notes and appendices to
his dramas and poems, long extracts from old chronicles, from Plutarch's
_Lives_, from French and Italian histories, which he had read himself,
and, as he fondly believed, would be read by others, who were willing to
submit themselves to his guidance. He expected his readers to take some
trouble and to display some intelligence.

Poetry is successful only so far as it is intelligible. To a clear cry
an answer comes, but not to a muffled call. The reader who comes within
speaking distance of his author can hear him, and to bring the living
within speaking distance of the dead, the living must know the facts,
and understand the ideas which informed and inspired the dead. Thought
and attention are scarcely to be reckoned among necromantic arts, but
thought and knowledge "can make these bones live," and stand upon their
feet, if they do not leap and sing.

I desire to renew my acknowledgments of the generous assistance of the
officials of the British Museum, and, more especially, of Mr. Ernest
Wallis Budge, Litt.D., M.A., _Keeper of Egyptian and Assyrian
Antiquities_; of Mr. Leonard W. King, M.A., of the same department; and
of Mr. George F. Barwick, _Superintendent of the Reading Room_.

To Dr. Garnett, C.B., I am greatly indebted for invaluable hints and
suggestions with regard to the interpretation of some obscure passages
in _The Age of Bronze_ and other parts of the volume, and for reading
the proofs of the "Introduction" and "Note to the Introduction to
_Werner_."

I have also to acknowledge the assistance and advice of Mr. W. Hale
White, and of my friend Mr. Frank E. Taylor, of Chertsey.

For assistance during the preparation of the volume, and more especially
in the revision of proofs, I desire to express my cordial thanks to Mr.
John Murray.

                                A TRAGEDY.

[_Sardanapale, Tragedie Imitee de Lord Byron_, par L. Alvin, was
performed at the Theatre Royal at Brussels, January 13, 16, 1834.

_Sardanapalus_, a Tragedy, was played for the first time at Drury Lane
Theatre, April 10, 1834, and (for the twenty-second time) June 5, 1834.
Macready appeared as "Sardanapalus," Miss Phillips as "Zarina," and Miss
Ellen Tree as "Myrrha." [In his diary for April 11, 1834 (see
_Reminiscences_, 1875, i. 414, 415) Macready wrote, "On arriving at my
chambers ... I found a letter without a signature; the seal was the head
of Byron, and in the envelope was a folded sheet with merely the words,
'Werner, Nov., 1830. Byron, Ravenna, 1821,' and 'Sardanapalus, April
10th, 1834.' Encircling the name of Byron, etc., was a lock of grey hair
fastened by a gold thread, which I am sure was Byron's, ... it surprised
and pleased me."]

_Sardanapalus, King of Assyria_, was produced at the Princess's Theatre,
June 13, 1853, and played till September 2, 1853. Charles Kean appeared
as "Sardanapalus," Miss Heath as "Zarina," and Mrs. Charles Kean as
"Myrrha."

_Sardanapale, Opera en Trois Actes_, par M. Henry Becque, Musique de M.
Victorin Joncieres, was performed for the first time at the Theatre
Imperial-Lyrique, February 8, 1867.

_Lord Byron's Tragedy of Sardanapalus_, in four acts, was performed at
the Theatre Royal, Manchester, March 31-April 28, 1877. Charles Calvert
(the adapter) played "Sardanapalus," Miss Hathaway "Zarina," and Miss
Fanny Ensor "Myrrha;" and June 26-July 27, 1877, at the Royal Alexandra
Theatre, Liverpool. Calvert's adaptation was also performed at Booth's
Theatre, New York.]




                      INTRODUCTION TO _SARDANAPALUS_


Byron's passion or infatuation for the regular drama lasted a little
over a year. _Marino Faliero_, _Sardanapalus_, and the _Two Foscari_,
were the fruits of his "self-denying ordinance to dramatize, like the
Greeks ... striking passages of history" (letter to Murray, July 14,
1821, _Letters_, 1901, v. 323). The mood was destined to pass, but for a
while the neophyte was spell-bound.

_Sardanapalus, a Tragedy_, the second and, perhaps, the most successful
of these studies in the poetry of history, was begun at Ravenna, January
13, 1821, "with all deliberate speed;" but, for a time, from laziness or
depression of spirits, or, perhaps, from the counter-excitement of "the
poetry of politics" (_Letters_, 1901, v. 205), that is, the
revolutionary drama which had begun to run its course, a month went by
before he had finished the first act (February 15). Three months later
(May 28) he announces the completion of the drama, the last act having
been "dashed off" in two or three days (_Letters_, 1901, v. 300).

For the story of Sardanapalus, which had excited his interest as a
schoolboy, Byron consulted the pages of Diodorus Siculus (_Bibliothecae
Historicae_, lib. ii. pp. 78, sq., ed. 1604), and, possibly to ward off
and neutralize the distracting influence of Shakespeare and other
barbarian dramatists, he "turned over" the tragedies of Seneca
(_Letters_, 1901, v. 173). It is hardly necessary to remind the modern
reader that the Sardanapalus of history is an unverified if not an
unverifiable personage. Diodorus the Sicilian, who was contemporary with
Cicero, derived his knowledge of Assyrian history from the _Persica_ of
Ctesias of Cnidos, who was private physician at the court of Artaxerxes
Mnemon (B.C. 405-359), and is said to have had access to, and to have
consulted, the "Persian authorities" (???????? ????????? [diphthe/rai
Basilikai\]).

The character which Ctesias depicted or invented, an effeminate
debauchee, sunk in luxury and sloth, who at the last was driven to take
up arms, and, after a prolonged but ineffectual resistance, avoided
capture by suicide, cannot be identified. Asurbanipal
(Asur-b?ni-apli), the son of Esarhaddon and grandson of
Sennacherib, who ascended the throne B.C. 668, and reigned for about
forty years, was, as the cuneiform records and the friezes of his palace
testify, a bold hunter and a mighty warrior. He vanquished Tark?
(Tirhakah) of Ethiopia, and his successor, Urdaman?. Ba'al King of Tyre,
Yakinl? King of the island-city of Arvad, Sand?sarm? of Cilicia,
Teumman of Elam, and other potentates, suffered defeat at his hands.
"The land of Elam," writes the king or his "Historiographer Royal,"
"through its extent I covered as when a mighty storm approaches; I cut
off the head of Teumman, their king... Beyond number I slew his
warriors; alive in my hands I took his fighting men; with their corpses,
as with thorns and thistles, I filled the vicinity of Susa; their blood
I caused to flow in the Eulaeus, and I stained its waters like wool."
Clearly the Sardanapalus who painted his face and carded purple wool in
the _penetralia_ of his seraglio does not bear even a traditional
resemblance to Asur-b?ni-apli the Conqueror.

All that can be affirmed with any certainty is that within twenty years
of the death of Asurbanipal, the Assyrian Empire passed into the hands
of the Medes;[1] but there is nothing to show whether the period of
decay had already set in before the close of his reign, or under which
of his two successors, ?sur-etil-il?ni or Sin-sar-iskun,
the final catastrophe (B.C. 606) took place (_Encyclopedia Biblica_,
art. "Assyria," art. "?sur-bani-pal," by Leonard W. King).

"I have made," writes Byron (May 25, 1821), "Sardanapalus brave though
voluptuous (as history represents him), and as amiable as my poor pen
could make him." Diodorus, or rather Ctesias, who may have drawn upon
personal reminiscences of his patron, Artaxerxes Mnemon (see Plutarch's
_Artaxerxes_, _passim_), does not enlarge upon his amiability, and
credits him only with the courage of despair. Byron's Sardanapalus, with
his sudden transition from voluptuous abandonment to heroic chivalry,
his remorseful recognition of the sanctities of wedlock, his general
good nature, his "sly, insinuating sarcasms" (Moore's Diary, September
30, 1821, _Memoirs_, iii. 282), "all made out of the carver's brain,"
resembles _history_ as little as _history_ resembles the Assyrian
record. Fortunately, the genius of the poet escaped from the meshes
which he had woven round himself, and, in spite of himself, he was
constrained to "beat his music out," regardless of his authorities.

The character of Myrrha, which bears some resemblance to Aspasia, "a
native of Phocea in Ionia--the favourite mistress of Cyrus" (see
Plutarch's _Artaxerxes_, Langhorne's Translation, 1838, p. 699), was
introduced partly to pacify the Countess Guiccioli, who had quarrelled
with him for maintaining that "love was not the loftiest theme for true
tragedy," and, in part, to prove that he was not a slave to his own
ideals, and could imagine and delineate a woman who was both passionate
and high-minded. Diodorus (_Bibl. Hist._, lib. iii. p. 130) records the
exploits of Myrina, Queen of the Amazons, but it is probable that Byron
named his Ionian slave after Mirra, who gives her name to Alfieri's
tragedy, which brought on a convulsive fit of tears and shuddering when
he first saw it played at Bologna in August, 1819 (_Letters_, 1900, iv.
339).

_Sardanapalus, a Tragedy_, was published together with _The Two Foscari,
a Tragedy_, and _Cain, a Mystery_, December 19, 1821.

The three plays were reviewed by Heber in the _Quarterly Review_, July,
1822, vol. xxvii. pp. 476-524; by Jeffrey in the _Edinburgh Review_,
February, 1822, vol. 36, pp. 413-452; in _Blackwood's Edinburgh
Magazine_, February, 1822, vol. xi. pp. 212-217; and in the _Portfolio_
(Philadelphia), December, 1822, vol. xiv. pp. 487-492.

                                 PREFACE

In publishing the following Tragedies[3] I have only to repeat, that
they were not composed with the most remote view to the stage. On the
attempt made by the managers in a former instance, the public opinion
has been already expressed. With regard to my own private feelings, as
it seems that they are to stand for nothing, I shall say nothing.

For the historical foundation of the following compositions the reader
is referred to the Notes.

The Author has in one instance attempted to preserve, and in the other
to approach, the "unities;" conceiving that with any very distant
departure from them, there may be poetry, but can be no drama. He is
aware of the unpopularity of this notion in present English literature;
but it is not a system of his own, being merely an opinion, which, not
very long ago, was the law of literature throughout the world, and is
still so in the more civilised parts of it. But "nous avons change tout
cela," and are reaping the advantages of the change. The writer is far
from conceiving that any thing he can adduce by personal precept or
example can at all approach his regular, or even irregular predecessors:
he is merely giving a reason why he preferred the more regular formation
of a structure, however feeble, to an entire abandonment of all rules
whatsoever. Where he has failed, the failure is in the architect,--and
not in the art.

In this tragedy it has been my intention to follow the account of
Diodorus Siculus;[4] reducing it, however, to such dramatic regularity
as I best could, and trying to approach the unities. I therefore suppose
the rebellion to explode and succeed in one day by a sudden conspiracy,
instead of the long war of the history.

                    SCENE I.--_A Hall in the Palace_.


    _Salemenes_ (_solus_).
    He hath wronged his queen, but still he is her lord;
    He hath wronged my sister--still he is my brother;
    He hath wronged his people--still he is their sovereign--
    And I must be his friend as well as subject:
    He must not perish thus. I will not see
    The blood of Nimrod and Semiramis
    Sink in the earth, and thirteen hundred years
    Of Empire ending like a shepherd's tale;
    He must be roused. In his effeminate heart
    There is a careless courage which Corruption                        10
    Has not all quenched, and latent energies,
    Repressed by circumstance, but not destroyed--
    Steeped, but not drowned, in deep voluptuousness.
    If born a peasant, he had been a man
    To have reached an empire: to an empire born,
    He will bequeath none; nothing but a name,
    Which his sons will not prize in heritage:--
    Yet--not all lost--even yet--he may redeem
    His sloth and shame, by only being that
    Which he should be, as easily as the thing                          20
    He should not be and is. Were it less toil
    To sway his nations than consume his life?
    To head an army than to rule a harem?
    He sweats in palling pleasures, dulls his soul,[a]
    And saps his goodly strength, in toils which yield not
    Health like the chase, nor glory like the war--
    He must be roused. Alas! there is no sound
                                 [_Sound of soft music heard from within_.
    To rouse him short of thunder. Hark! the lute--
    The lyre--the timbrel; the lascivious tinklings
    Of lulling instruments, the softening voices                        30
    Of women, and of beings less than women,
    Must chime in to the echo of his revel,
    While the great King of all we know of earth
    Lolls crowned with roses, and his diadem
    Lies negligently by to be caught up
    By the first manly hand which dares to snatch it.
    Lo, where they come! already I perceive
    The reeking odours of the perfumed trains,
    And see the bright gems of the glittering girls,[b]
    At once his Chorus and his Council, flash                           40
    Along the gallery, and amidst the damsels,
    As femininely garbed, and scarce less female,
    The grandson of Semiramis, the Man-Queen.--
    He comes! Shall I await him? yes, and front him,
    And tell him what all good men tell each other,
    Speaking of him and his. They come, the slaves
    Led by the monarch subject to his slaves.


                                SCENE II.

           _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _effeminately dressed, his Head
         crowned with Flowers, and his Robe negligently flowing,
             attended by a Train of Women and young Slaves_.

    _Sar._ (_speaking to some of his attendants_).
    Let the pavilion[6] over the Euphrates
    Be garlanded, and lit, and furnished forth
    For an especial banquet; at the hour
    Of midnight we will sup there: see nought wanting,
    And bid the galley be prepared. There is
    A cooling breeze which crisps the broad clear river:
    We will embark anon. Fair Nymphs, who deign
    To share the soft hours of Sardanapalus,
    We'll meet again in that the sweetest hour,
    When we shall gather like the stars above us,                       10
    And you will form a heaven as bright as theirs;
    Till then, let each be mistress of her time,
    And thou, my own Ionian Myrrha,[7] choose;
    Wilt thou along with them or me?

    _Myr._                          My Lord--

    _Sar._ My Lord!--my Life! why answerest thou so coldly?
    It is the curse of kings to be so answered.
    Rule thy own hours, thou rulest mine--say, wouldst thou
    Accompany our guests, or charm away
    The moments from me?

    _Myr._              The King's choice is mine.

    _Sar._ I pray thee say not so: my chiefest joy                      20
    Is to contribute to thine every wish.
    I do not dare to breathe my own desire,
    Lest it should clash with thine; for thou art still
    Too prompt to sacrifice thy thoughts for others.

    _Myr._ I would remain: I have no happiness
    Save in beholding thine; yet--

    _Sar._                         Yet! what YET?
    Thy own sweet will shall be the only barrier
    Which ever rises betwixt thee and me.

    _Myr._ I think the present is the wonted hour
    Of council; it were better I retire.                                30

    _Sal._ (_comes forward and says_)
    The Ionian slave says well: let her retire.

    _Sar._ Who answers? How now, brother?

    _Sal._                               The _Queen's_ brother,
    And your most faithful vassal, royal Lord.

    _Sar._ (_addressing his train_).
    As I have said, let all dispose their hours
    Till midnight, when again we pray your presence.
                                                    [_The court retiring_.
    (_To_ MYRRHA,[c] _who is going_.)
    Myrrha! I thought _thou_ wouldst remain.

    _Myr._                                  Great King,
    Thou didst not say so.

    _Sar._                 But _thou_ looked'st it:
    I know each glance of those Ionic eyes,[d]
    Which said thou wouldst not leave me.

    _Myr._                               Sire! your brother----

    _Sal._ His _Consort's_ brother, minion of Ionia!                    40
    How darest _thou_ name _me_ and not blush?

    _Sar._                                    Not blush!
    Thou hast no more eyes than heart to make her crimson
    Like to the dying day on Caucasus,
    Where sunset tints the snow with rosy shadows,
    And then reproach her with thine own cold blindness,
    Which will not see it. What! in tears, my Myrrha?

    _Sal._ Let them flow on; she weeps for more than one,
    And is herself the cause of bitterer tears.

    _Sar._ Cursed be he who caused those tears to flow!

    _Sal._ Curse not thyself--millions do that already.                 50

    _Sar._ Thou dost forget thee: make me not remember
    I am a monarch.

    _Sal._          Would thou couldst!

    _Myr._                               My sovereign,
    I pray, and thou, too, Prince, permit my absence.

    _Sar._ Since it must be so, and this churl has checked
    Thy gentle spirit, go; but recollect
    That we must forthwith meet: I had rather lose
    An empire than thy presence.                           [_Exit_ MYRRHA.

    _Sal._                       It may be,
    Thou wilt lose both--and both for ever!

    _Sar._                                  Brother!
    I can at least command myself, who listen
    To language such as this: yet urge me not                           60
    Beyond my easy nature.

    _Sal._                 'Tis beyond
    That easy--far too easy--idle nature,
    Which I would urge thee. O that I could rouse thee!
    Though 'twere against myself.

    _Sar._                        By the god Baal!
    The man would make me tyrant.

    _Sal._                        So thou art.
    Think'st thou there is no tyranny but that
    Of blood and chains? The despotism of vice,
    The weakness and the wickedness of luxury,
    The negligence, the apathy, the evils
    Of sensual sloth--produce ten thousand tyrants,                     70
    Whose delegated cruelty surpasses
    The worst acts of one energetic master,
    However harsh and hard in his own bearing.
    The false and fond examples of thy lusts
    Corrupt no less than they oppress, and sap
    In the same moment all thy pageant power
    And those who should sustain it; so that whether
    A foreign foe invade, or civil broil
    Distract within, both will alike prove fatal:
    The first thy subjects have no heart to conquer;                    80
    The last they rather would assist than vanquish.

    _Sar._ Why, what makes thee the mouth-piece of the people?

    _Sal._ Forgiveness of the Queen, my sister wrongs;
    A natural love unto my infant nephews;
    Faith to the King, a faith he may need shortly,
    In more than words; respect for Nimrod's line;
    Also, another thing thou knowest not.

    _Sar._ What's that?

    _Sal._               To thee an unknown word.

    _Sar._                                        Yet speak it;
    I love to learn.

    _Sal._           Virtue.

    _Sar._                  Not know the word!
    Never was word yet rung so in my ears--                             90
    Worse than the rabble's shout, or splitting trumpet:
    I've heard thy sister talk of nothing else.

    _Sal._ To change the irksome theme, then, hear of vice.

    _Sar._ From whom?

    _Sal._             Even from the winds, if thou couldst listen
    Unto the echoes of the Nation's voice.

    _Sar._ Come, I'm indulgent, as thou knowest, patient,
    As thou hast often proved--speak out, what moves thee?

    _Sal._ Thy peril.

    _Sar._             Say on.

    _Sal._                     Thus, then: all the nations,
    For they are many, whom thy father left
    In heritage, are loud in wrath against thee.                       100

    _Sar._ 'Gainst _me!!_ What would the slaves?

    _Sal._                                         A king.

    _Sar._                                                 And what
    Am I then?

    _Sal._     In their eyes a nothing; but
    In mine a man who might be something still.

    _Sar._ The railing drunkards! why, what would they have?
    Have they not peace and plenty?

    _Sal._                          Of the first
    More than is glorious: of the last, far less
    Than the King recks of.

    _Sar._                  Whose then is the crime,
    But the false satraps, who provide no better?

    _Sal._ And somewhat in the Monarch who ne'er looks
    Beyond his palace walls, or if he stirs                            110
    Beyond them, 'tis but to some mountain palace,
    Till summer heats wear down. O glorious Baal!
    Who built up this vast empire, and wert made
    A God, or at the least shinest like a God
    Through the long centuries of thy renown,
    This, thy presumed descendant, ne'er beheld
    As king the kingdoms thou didst leave as hero,
    Won with thy blood, and toil, and time, and peril!
    For what? to furnish imposts for a revel,
    Or multiplied extortions for a minion.                             120

    _Sar._ I understand thee--thou wouldst have me go
    Forth as a conqueror. By all the stars
    Which the Chaldeans read--the restless slaves[e]
    Deserve that I should curse them with their wishes,
    And lead them forth to glory.

    _Sal._                       Wherefore not?
    Semiramis--a woman only--led
    These our Assyrians to the solar shores
    Of Ganges.

    _Sar._    Tis most true. And _how_ returned?

    _Sal._ Why, like a _man_--a hero; baffled, but
    Not vanquished. With but twenty guards, she made                   130
    Good her retreat to Bactria.

    _Sar._                       And how many
    Left she behind in India to the vultures?

    _Sal._ Our annals say not.

    _Sar._                    Then I will say for them--
    That she had better woven within her palace
    Some twenty garments, than with twenty guards
    Have fled to Bactria, leaving to the ravens,
    And wolves, and men--the fiercer of the three,
    Her myriads of fond subjects. Is _this_ Glory?
    Then let me live in ignominy ever.

    _Sal._ All warlike spirits have not the same fate.                 140
    Semiramis, the glorious parent of
    A hundred kings, although she failed in India,
    Brought Persia--Media--Bactria--to the realm
    Which she once swayed--and thou _mightst_ sway.

    _Sar._                                         _I sway_ them--
    She but subdued them.

    _Sal._                It may be ere long
    That they will need her sword more than your sceptre.

    _Sar._ There was a certain Bacchus, was there not?
    I've heard my Greek girls speak of such--they say
    He was a God, that is, a Grecian god,
    An idol foreign to Assyria's worship,                              150
    Who conquered this same golden realm of Ind
    Thou prat'st of, where Semiramis was vanquished.

    _Sal._ I have heard of such a man; and thou perceiv'st
    That he is deemed a God for what he did.

    _Sar._ And in his godship I will honour him--
    Not much as man. What, ho! my cupbearer!

    _Sal._ What means the King?

    _Sar._                     To worship your new God
    And ancient conqueror. Some wine, I say.

                            _Enter Cupbearer_.

    _Sar._ (_addressing the Cupbearer_).
    Bring me the golden goblet thick with gems,
    Which bears the name of Nimrod's chalice. Hence,                   160
    Fill full, and bear it quickly.                     [_Exit Cupbearer_.

    _Sal._                         Is this moment
    A fitting one for the resumption of
    Thy yet unslept-off revels?

                     _Re-enter Cupbearer, with wine_.

    _Sar._ (_taking the cup from him_). Noble kinsman,
    If these barbarian Greeks of the far shores
    And skirts of these our realms lie not, this Bacchus
    Conquered the whole of India,[8] did he not?

    _Sal._ He did, and thence was deemed a Deity.[f]

    _Sar._ Not so:--of all his conquests a few columns.[9]
    Which may be his, and might be mine, if I
    Thought them worth purchase and conveyance, are                    170
    The landmarks of the seas of gore he shed,
    The realms he wasted, and the hearts he broke.
    But here--here in this goblet is his title
    To immortality--the immortal grape
    From which he first expressed the soul, and gave
    To gladden that of man, as some atonement
    For the victorious mischiefs he had done.
    Had it not been for this, he would have been
    A mortal still in name as in his grave;
    And, like my ancestor Semiramis,                                   180
    A sort of semi-glorious human monster.
    Here's that which deified him--let it now
    Humanise thee; my surly, chiding brother,
    Pledge me to the Greek God!

    _Sal._                      For all thy realms
    I would not so blaspheme our country's creed.

    _Sar._ That is to say, thou thinkest him a hero,
    That he shed blood by oceans; and no God,
    Because he turned a fruit to an enchantment,
    Which cheers the sad, revives the old, inspires
    The young, makes Weariness forget his toil,                        190
    And Fear her danger; opens a new world
    When this, the present, palls. Well, then _I_ pledge thee
    And _him_ as a true man, who did his utmost
    In good or evil to surprise mankind.                        [_Drinks_.

    _Sal._ Wilt thou resume a revel at this hour?

    _Sar._ And if I did, 'twere better than a trophy,
    Being bought without a tear. But that is not
    My present purpose: since thou wilt not pledge me,
    Continue what thou pleasest.
    (_To the Cupbearer_.)       Boy, retire.            [_Exit Cupbearer_.

    _Sal._ I would but have recalled thee from thy dream;              200
    Better by me awakened than rebellion.

    _Sar._ Who should rebel? or why? what cause? pretext?
    I am the lawful King, descended from
    A race of Kings who knew no predecessors.
    What have I done to thee, or to the people,
    That thou shouldst rail, or they rise up against me?

    _Sal._ Of what thou hast done to me, I speak not.

    _Sar._                                             But
    Thou think'st that I have wronged the Queen: is't not so?

    _Sal._ _Think!_ Thou hast wronged her!

    _Sar._                                Patience, Prince, and hear me.
    She has all power and splendour of her station,                    210
    Respect, the tutelage of Assyria's heirs,
    The homage and the appanage of sovereignty.
    I married her as monarchs wed--for state,
    And loved her as most husbands love their wives.
    If she or thou supposedst I could link me
    Like a Chaldean peasant to his mate,
    Ye knew nor me--nor monarchs--nor mankind.

    _Sal._ I pray thee, change the theme: my blood disdains
    Complaint, and Salemenes' sister seeks not
    Reluctant love even from Assyria's lord!                           220
    Nor would she deign to accept divided passion
    With foreign strumpets and Ionian slaves.
    The Queen is silent.

    _Sar._               And why not her brother?

    _Sal._ I only echo thee the voice of empires,
    Which he who long neglects not long will govern.

    _Sar._ The ungrateful and ungracious slaves! they murmur
    Because I have not shed their blood, nor led them
    To dry into the desert's dust by myriads,
    Or whiten with their bones the banks of Ganges;
    Nor decimated them with savage laws,                               230
    Nor sweated them to build up Pyramids,
    Or Babylonian walls.

    _Sal._               Yet these are trophies
    More worthy of a people and their prince
    Than songs, and lutes, and feasts, and concubines,
    And lavished treasures, and contemned virtues.

    _Sar._ Or for my trophies I have founded cities:
    There's Tarsus and Anchialus, both built
    In one day--what could that blood-loving beldame,
    My martial grandam, chaste Semiramis,
    Do more, except destroy them?

    _Sal._                        'Tis most true;                      240
    I own thy merit in those founded cities,
    Built for a whim, recorded with a verse
    Which shames both them and thee to coming ages.

    _Sar._ Shame me! By Baal, the cities, though well built,
    Are not more goodly than the verse! Say what
    Thou wilt 'gainst me, my mode of life or rule,
    But nothing 'gainst the truth of that brief record.
    Why, those few lines contain the history
    Of all things human: hear--"Sardanapalus,
    The king, and son of Anacyndaraxes,                                250
    In one day built Anchialus and Tarsus.
    Eat, drink, and love; the rest's not worth a fillip."[10]

    _Sal._ A worthy moral, and a wise inscription,
    For a king to put up before his subjects!

    _Sar._ Oh, thou wouldst have me doubtless set up edicts--
    "Obey the king--contribute to his treasure--
    Recruit his phalanx--spill your blood at bidding--
    Fall down and worship, or get up and toil."
    Or thus--"Sardanapalus on this spot
    Slew fifty thousand of his enemies.                                260
    These are their sepulchres, and this his trophy."
    I leave such things to conquerors; enough
    For me, if I can make my subjects feel
    The weight of human misery less, and glide
    Ungroaning to the tomb: I take no license
    Which I deny to them. We all are men.

    _Sal._ Thy Sires have been revered as Gods--

    _Sar._                                        In dust
    And death, where they are neither Gods nor men.
    Talk not of such to me! the worms are Gods;[11]
    At least they banqueted upon your Gods,                            270
    And died for lack of farther nutriment.
    Those Gods were merely men; look to their issue--
    I feel a thousand mortal things about me,
    But nothing godlike,--unless it may be
    The thing which you condemn, a disposition
    To love and to be merciful, to pardon
    The follies of my species, and (that's human)
    To be indulgent to my own.

    _Sal._                    Alas!
    The doom of Nineveh is sealed.--Woe--woe
    To the unrivalled city!

    _Sar._                  What dost dread?                           280

    _Sal._ Thou art guarded by thy foes: in a few hours
    The tempest may break out which overwhelms thee,
    And thine and mine; and in another day
    What _is_ shall be the past of Belus' race.

    _Sar._ What must we dread?

    _Sal._                    Ambitious treachery,
    Which has environed thee with snares; but yet
    There is resource: empower me with thy signet
    To quell the machinations, and I lay
    The heads of thy chief foes before thy feet.

    _Sar._ The heads--how many?

    _Sal._                     Must I stay to number             290
    When even thine own's in peril? Let me go;
    Give me thy signet--trust me with the rest.

    _Sar._ I will trust no man with unlimited lives.
    When we take those from others, we nor know
    What we have taken, nor the thing we give.

    _Sal._ Wouldst thou not take their lives who seek for thine?

    _Sar._ That's a hard question--But I answer, Yes.
    Cannot the thing be done without? Who are they
    Whom thou suspectest?--Let them be arrested.

    _Sal._ I would thou wouldst not ask me; the next moment            300
    Will send my answer through thy babbling troop
    Of paramours, and thence fly o'er the palace,
    Even to the city, and so baffle all.--
    Trust me.

    _Sar._      Thou knowest I have done so ever;
    Take thou the signet.                             [_Gives the signet_.

    _Sal._                I have one more request.

    _Sar._ Name it.

    _Sal._           That thou this night forbear the banquet
    In the pavilion over the Euphrates.

    _Sar._ Forbear the banquet! Not for all the plotters
    That ever shook a kingdom! Let them come,
    And do their worst: I shall not blench for them;                   310
    Nor rise the sooner; nor forbear the goblet;
    Nor crown me with a single rose the less;
    Nor lose one joyous hour.--I fear them not.

    _Sal._ But thou wouldst arm thee, wouldst thou not, if needful?

    _Sar._ Perhaps. I have the goodliest armour, and
    A sword of such a temper, and a bow,
    And javelin, which might furnish Nimrod forth:
    A little heavy, but yet not unwieldy.
    And now I think on't, 'tis long since I've used them,
    Even in the chase. Hast ever seen them, brother?                   320

    _Sal._ Is this a time for such fantastic trifling?--
    If need be, wilt thou wear them?

    _Sar._                           Will I not?
    Oh! if it must be so, and these rash slaves
    Will not be ruled with less, I'll use the sword
    Till they shall wish it turned into a distaff.

    _Sal._ They say thy Sceptre's turned to that already.

    _Sar._ That's false! but let them say so: the old Greeks,
    Of whom our captives often sing, related
    The same of their chief hero, Hercules,
    Because he loved a Lydian queen: thou seest                        330
    The populace of all the nations seize
    Each calumny they can to sink their sovereigns.

    _Sal._ They did not speak thus of thy fathers.

    _Sar._                                         No;
    They dared not. They were kept to toil and combat;
    And never changed their chains but for their armour:
    Now they have peace and pastime, and the license
    To revel and to rail; it irks me not.
    I would not give the smile of one fair girl
    For all the popular breath[12] that e'er divided
    A name from nothing. What are the rank tongues[13]                 340
    Of this vile herd, grown insolent with feeding,
    That I should prize their noisy praise, or dread
    Their noisome clamour?

    _Sal._                You have said they are men;
    As such their hearts are something.

    _Sar._                             So my dogs' are;
    And better, as more faithful:--but, proceed;
    Thou hast my signet:--since they are tumultuous,
    Let them be tempered, yet not roughly, till
    Necessity enforce it. I hate all pain,
    Given or received; we have enough within us,
    The meanest vassal as the loftiest monarch,                        350
    Not to add to each other's natural burthen
    Of mortal misery, but rather lessen,
    By mild reciprocal alleviation,
    The fatal penalties imposed on life:
    But this they know not, or they will not know.
    I have, by Baal! done all I could to soothe them:
    I made no wars, I added no new imposts,
    I interfered not with their civic lives,
    I let them pass their days as best might suit them,
    Passing my own as suited me.

    _Sal._                       Thou stopp'st                         360
    Short of the duties of a king; and therefore
    They say thou art unfit to be a monarch.

    _Sar._ They lie.--Unhappily, I am unfit
    To be aught save a monarch; else for me
    The meanest Mede might be the king instead.

    _Sal._ There is one Mede, at least, who seeks to be so.

    _Sar._ What mean'st thou!--'tis thy secret; thou desirest
    Few questions, and I'm not of curious nature.
    Take the fit steps; and, since necessity
    Requires, I sanction and support thee. Ne'er                       370
    Was man who more desired to rule in peace
    The peaceful only: if they rouse me, better
    They had conjured up stern Nimrod from his ashes,
    "The Mighty Hunter!" I will turn these realms
    To one wide desert chase of brutes, who _were_,
    But _would_ no more, by their own choice, be human.
    _What_ they have found me, they belie; _that which_
    They yet may find me--shall defy their wish
    To speak it worse; and let them thank themselves.

    _Sal._ Then thou at last canst feel?

    _Sar._                              Feel! who feels not            380
    Ingratitude?[14]

    _Sal._      I will not pause to answer
    With words, but deeds. Keep thou awake that energy
    Which sleeps at times, but is not dead within thee,
    And thou may'st yet be glorious in thy reign,
    As powerful in thy realm. Farewell!                 [_Exit_ SALEMENES.

    _Sar._ (_solus_).                 Farewell!
    He's gone; and on his finger bears my signet,
    Which is to him a sceptre. He is stern
    As I am heedless; and the slaves deserve
    To feel a master. What may be the danger,
    I know not: he hath found it, let him quell it.                    390
    Must I consume my life--this little life--
    In guarding against all may make it less?
    It is not worth so much! It were to die
    Before my hour, to live in dread of death,
    Tracing revolt; suspecting all about me,
    Because they are near; and all who are remote,
    Because they are far. But if it should be so--
    If they should sweep me off from Earth and Empire,
    Why, what is Earth or Empire of the Earth?
    I have loved, and lived, and multiplied my image;                  400
    To die is no less natural than those
    Acts of this clay! 'Tis true I have not shed
    Blood as I might have done, in oceans, till
    My name became the synonyme of Death--
    A terror and a trophy. But for this
    I feel no penitence; my life is love:
    If I must shed blood, it shall be by force.
    Till now, no drop from an Assyrian vein
    Hath flowed for me, nor hath the smallest coin
    Of Nineveh's vast treasures e'er been lavished                     410
    On objects which could cost her sons a tear:
    If then they hate me, 'tis because I hate not:
    If they rebel, 'tis because I oppress not.
    Oh, men! ye must be ruled with scythes, not sceptres,
    And mowed down like the grass, else all we reap
    Is rank abundance, and a rotten harvest
    Of discontents infecting the fair soil,
    Making a desert of fertility.--
    I'll think no more.--Within there, ho!

                          _Enter an_ ATTENDANT.

    _Sar._                                Slave, tell
    The Ionian Myrrha we would crave her presence.                     420

    _Attend._ King, she is here.

                             MYRRHA _enters_.

    _Sar._ (_apart to Attendant_). Away!

    (_Addressing_ MYRRHA.)              Beautiful being!
    Thou dost almost anticipate my heart;
    It throbbed for thee, and here thou comest: let me
    Deem that some unknown influence, some sweet oracle,
    Communicates between us, though unseen,
    In absence, and attracts us to each other.

    _Myr._ There doth.

    _Sar._             I know there doth, but not its name:
    What is it?

    _Myr._       In my native land a God,
    And in my heart a feeling like a God's,
    Exalted; yet I own 'tis only mortal;                               430
    For what I feel is humble, and yet happy--
    That is, it would be happy; but----                  [MYRRHA _pauses_.

    _Sar._                             There comes
    For ever something between us and what
    We deem our happiness: let me remove
    The barrier which that hesitating accent
    Proclaims to thine, and mine is sealed.

    _Myr._                                  My Lord!--

    _Sar._ My Lord--my King--Sire--Sovereign; thus it is--
    For ever thus, addressed with awe. I ne'er
    Can see a smile, unless in some broad banquet's
    Intoxicating glare, when the buffoons                              440
    Have gorged themselves up to equality,
    Or I have quaffed me down to their abasement.
    Myrrha, I can hear all these things, these names,
    Lord--King--Sire--Monarch--nay, time was I prized them;
    That is, I suffered them--from slaves and nobles;
    But when they falter from the lips I love,
    The lips which have been pressed to mine, a chill
    Comes o'er my heart, a cold sense of the falsehood
    Of this my station, which represses feeling
    In those for whom I have felt most, and makes me                   450
    Wish that I could lay down the dull tiara,
    And share a cottage on the Caucasus
    With thee--and wear no crowns but those of flowers.

    _Myr._ Would that we could!

    _Sar._                     And dost _thou_ feel this?--Why?

    _Myr._ Then thou wouldst know what thou canst never know.

    _Sar._ And that is----

    _Myr._                  The true value of a heart;
    At least, a woman's.

    _Sar._               I have proved a thousand--A
    thousand, and a thousand.

    _Myr._                   Hearts?

    _Sar._                          I think so.

    _Myr._ Not one! the time may come thou may'st.

    _Sar._                                          It will.
    Hear, Myrrha; Salemenes has declared--                             460
    Or why or how he hath divined it, Belus,
    Who founded our great realm, knows more than I--
    But Salemenes hath declared my throne
    In peril.

    _Myr._    He did well.

    _Sar._                And say'st _thou_ so?
    Thou whom he spurned so harshly, and now dared[g]
    Drive from our presence with his savage jeers,
    And made thee weep and blush?

    _Myr._                        I should do both
    More frequently, and he did well to call me
    Back to my duty. But thou spakest of peril
    Peril to thee----

    _Sar._            Aye, from dark plots and snares                  470
    From Medes--and discontented troops and nations.
    I know not what--a labyrinth of things--
    A maze of muttered threats and mysteries:
    Thou know'st the man--it is his usual custom.
    But he is honest. Come, we'll think no more on't--
    But of the midnight festival.

    _Myr._                       'Tis time
    To think of aught save festivals. Thou hast not
    Spurned his sage cautions?

    _Sar._                     What?--and dost thou fear?

    _Myr._ Fear!--I'm a Greek, and how should I fear death?
    A slave, and wherefore should I dread my freedom?                  480

    _Sar._ Then wherefore dost thou turn so pale?

    _Myr._                                         I love.

    _Sar._ And do not I? I love thee far--far more
    Than either the brief life or the wide realm,
    Which, it may be, are menaced;--yet I blench not.

    _Myr._ That means thou lovest nor thyself nor me;
    For he who loves another loves himself,
    Even for that other's sake. This is too rash:
    Kingdoms and lives are not to be so lost.

    _Sar._ Lost!--why, who is the aspiring chief who dared
    Assume to win them?

    _Myr._             Who is he should dread                          490
    To try so much? When he who is their ruler
    Forgets himself--will they remember him?

    _Sar._ Myrrha!

    _Myr._        Frown not upon me: you have smiled
    Too often on me not to make those frowns
    Bitterer to bear than any punishment
    Which they may augur.--King, I am your subject!
    Master, I am your slave! Man, I have loved you!--
    Loved you, I know not by what fatal weakness,
    Although a Greek, and born a foe to monarchs--
    A slave, and hating fetters--an Ionian,                            500
    And, therefore, when I love a stranger, more
    Degraded by that passion than by chains!
    Still I have loved you. If that love were strong
    Enough to overcome all former nature,
    Shall it not claim the privilege to save you?

    _Sar._ _Save_ me, my beauty! Thou art very fair,
    And what I seek of thee is love--not safety.

    _Myr._ And without love where dwells security?

    _Sar._ I speak of woman's love.

    _Myr._                         The very first
    Of human life must spring from woman's breast,                     510
    Your first small words are taught you from her lips,
    Your first tears quenched by her, and your last sighs
    Too often breathed out in a woman's hearing,
    When men have shrunk from the ignoble care
    Of watching the last hour of him who led them.

    _Sar._ My eloquent Ionian! thou speak'st music:
    The very chorus of the tragic song
    I have heard thee talk of as the favourite pastime
    Of thy far father-land. Nay, weep not--calm thee.

    _Myr._ I weep not.--But I pray thee, do not speak                  520
    About my fathers or their land.

    _Sar._                          Yet oft
    Thou speakest of them.

    _Myr._                 True--true: constant thought
    Will overflow in words unconsciously;
    But when another speaks of Greeks, it wounds me.

    _Sar._ Well, then, how wouldst thou _save_ me, as thou saidst?

    _Myr._ By teaching thee to save thyself, and not
    Thyself alone, but these vast realms, from all
    The rage of the worst war--the war of brethren.

    _Sar._ Why, child, I loathe all war, and warriors;
    I live in peace and pleasure: what can man                         530
    Do more?

    _Myr._       Alas! my Lord, with common men
    There needs too oft the show of war to keep
    The substance of sweet peace; and, for a king,
    'Tis sometimes better to be feared than loved.

    _Sar._ And I have never sought but for the last.

    _Myr._ And now art neither.

    _Sar._                      Dost _thou_ say so, Myrrha?

    _Myr._ I speak of civic popular love, _self_-love,
    Which means that men are kept in awe and law,
    Yet not oppressed--at least they must not think so,
    Or, if they think so, deem it necessary,                           540
    To ward off worse oppression, their own passions.
    A King of feasts, and flowers, and wine, and revel,
    And love, and mirth, was never King of Glory.

    _Sar._ Glory! what's that?

    _Myr._                     Ask of the Gods thy fathers.

    _Sar._ They cannot answer; when the priests speak for them,
    'Tis for some small addition to the temple.

    _Myr._ Look to the annals of thine Empire's founders.

    _Sar._ They are so blotted o'er with blood, I cannot.
    But what wouldst have? the Empire _has been_ founded.
    I cannot go on multiplying empires.                                550

    _Myr._ Preserve thine own.

    _Sar._                     At least, I will enjoy it.
    Come, Myrrha, let us go on to the Euphrates:
    The hour invites, the galley is prepared,
    And the pavilion, decked for our return,
    In fit adornment for the evening banquet,
    Shall blaze with beauty and with light, until
    It seems unto the stars which are above us
    Itself an opposite star; and we will sit
    Crowned with fresh flowers like----

    _Myr._                             Victims.

    _Sar._                                     No, like sovereigns,
    The Shepherd Kings of patriarchal times,                           560
    Who knew no brighter gems than summer wreaths,[h]
    And none but tearless triumphs. Let us on.

                              _Enter_ PANIA.

    _Pan._ May the King live for ever!

    _Sar._                           Not an hour
    Longer than he can love. How my soul hates
    This language, which makes life itself a lie,
    Flattering dust with eternity.[i] Well, Pania!
    Be brief.

    _Pan._      I am charged by Salemenes to
    Reiterate his prayer unto the King,
    That for this day, at least, he will not quit
    The palace: when the General returns,                              570
    He will adduce such reasons as will warrant
    His daring, and perhaps obtain the pardon
    Of his presumption.

    _Sar._               What! am I then cooped?
    Already captive? can I not even breathe
    The breath of heaven? Tell prince Salemenes,
    Were all Assyria raging round the walls
    In mutinous myriads, I would still go forth.

    _Pan._ I must obey, and yet----

    _Myr._                        Oh, Monarch, listen.--
    How many a day and moon thou hast reclined
    Within these palace walls in silken dalliance,                     580
    And never shown thee to thy people's longing;
    Leaving thy subjects' eyes ungratified,
    The satraps uncontrolled, the Gods unworshipped,
    And all things in the anarchy of sloth,
    Till all, save evil, slumbered through the realm!
    And wilt thou not now tarry for a day,--
    A day which may redeem thee? Wilt thou not
    Yield to the few still faithful a few hours,
    For them, for thee, for thy past fathers' race,
    And for thy sons' inheritance?

    _Pan._                         'Tis true!                          590
    From the deep urgency with which the Prince
    Despatched me to your sacred presence, I
    Must dare to add my feeble voice to that
    Which now has spoken.

    _Sar._               No, it must not be.

    _Myr._ For the sake of thy realm!

    _Sar._                             Away!

    _Pan._                                 For that
    Of all thy faithful subjects, who will rally
    Round thee and thine.

    _Sar._               These are mere fantasies:
    There is no peril:--'tis a sullen scheme
    Of Salemenes, to approve his zeal,
    And show himself more necessary to us.                             600

    _Myr._ By all that's good and glorious take this counsel.

    _Sar._ Business to-morrow.

    _Myr._                    Aye--or death to-night.

    _Sar._ Why let it come then unexpectedly,
    'Midst joy and gentleness, and mirth and love;
    So let me fall like the plucked rose!--far better
    Thus than be withered.

    _Myr._                 Then thou wilt not yield,
    Even for the sake of all that ever stirred
    A monarch into action, to forego
    A trifling revel.

    _Sar._            No.

    _Myr._               Then yield for _mine_;
    For my sake!

    _Sar._      Thine, my Myrrha!

    _Myr._                      'Tis the first                         610
    Boon which I ever asked Assyria's king.

    _Sar._ That's true, and, wer't my kingdom, must be granted.
    Well, for thy sake, I yield me. Pania, hence!
    Thou hear'st me.

    _Pan._           And obey.                              [_Exit_ PANIA.

    _Sar._                    I marvel at thee.
    What is thy motive, Myrrha, thus to urge me?

    _Myr._ Thy safety; and the certainty that nought
    Could urge the Prince thy kinsman to require
    Thus much from thee, but some impending danger.

    _Sar._ And if I do not dread it, why shouldst thou?

    _Myr._ Because _thou_ dost not fear, I fear for _thee_.            620

    _Sar._ To-morrow thou wilt smile at these vain fancies.

    _Myr._ If the worst come, I shall be where none weep,
    And that is better than the power to smile.
    And thou?

    _Sar._    I shall be King, as heretofore.

    _Myr._ Where?

    _Sar._         With Baal, Nimrod, and Semiramis,
    Sole in Assyria, or with them elsewhere.
    Fate made me what I am--may make me nothing--
    But either that or nothing must I be:
    I will not live degraded.

    _Myr._                    Hadst thou felt
    Thus always, none would ever dare degrade thee.                    630

    _Sar._ And who will do so now?

    _Myr._                        Dost thou suspect none?

    _Sar._ Suspect!--that's a spy's office. Oh! we lose
    Ten thousand precious moments in vain words,
    And vainer fears. Within there!--ye slaves, deck
    The Hall of Nimrod for the evening revel;
    If I must make a prison of our palace,
    At least we'll wear our fetters jocundly;
    If the Euphrates be forbid us, and
    The summer-dwelling on its beauteous border,
    Here we are still unmenaced. Ho! within there!                     640
                                                     [_Exit_ SARDANAPALUS.

    _Myr._ (_solus_).
    Why do I love this man? My country's daughters
    Love none but heroes. But I have no country!
    The slave hath lost all save her bonds. I love him;
    And that's the heaviest link of the long chain--
    To love whom we esteem not. Be it so:
    The hour is coming when he'll need all love,
    And find none. To fall from him now were baser
    Than to have stabbed him on his throne when highest
    Would have been noble in my country's creed:
    I was not made for either. Could I save him,                       650
    I should not love _him_ better, but myself;
    And I have need of the last, for I have fallen
    In my own thoughts, by loving this soft stranger:
    And yet, methinks, I love him more, perceiving
    That he is hated of his own barbarians,
    The natural foes of all the blood of Greece.
    Could I but wake a single thought like those
    Which even the Phrygians felt when battling long
    'Twixt Ilion and the sea, within his heart,
    He would tread down the barbarous crowds, and triumph.             660
    He loves me, and I love him; the slave loves
    Her master, and would free him from his vices.
    If not, I have a means of freedom still,
    And if I cannot teach him how to reign,
    May show him how alone a King can leave
    His throne. I must not lose him from my sight.                [_Exit_.





                                 ACT II.


          SCENE I.--_The Portal of the same Hall of the Palace_.

    _Beleses_ (_solus_).
    The Sun goes down: methinks he sets more slowly,
    Taking his last look of Assyria's Empire.
    How red he glares amongst those deepening clouds,
    Like the blood he predicts. If not in vain,
    Thou Sun that sinkest, and ye stars which rise,
    I have outwatched ye, reading ray by ray
    The edicts of your orbs, which make Time tremble[j]
    For what he brings the nations, 'tis the furthest
    Hour of Assyria's years. And yet how calm!
    An earthquake should announce so great a fall--                     10
    A summer's sun discloses it. Yon disk,
    To the star-read Chaldean, bears upon
    Its everlasting page the end of what
    Seemed everlasting; but oh! thou true Sun!
    The burning oracle of all that live,
    As fountain of all life, and symbol of
    Him who bestows it, wherefore dost thou limit
    Thy lore unto calamity? Why not
    Unfold the rise of days more worthy thine
    All-glorious burst from ocean? why not dart                         20
    A beam of hope athwart the future years,
    As of wrath to its days? Hear me! oh, hear me!
    I am thy worshipper, thy priest, thy servant--
    I have gazed on thee at thy rise and fall,
    And bowed my head beneath thy mid-day beams,
    When my eye dared not meet thee. I have watched
    For thee, and after thee, and prayed to thee,
    And sacrificed to thee, and read, and feared thee,
    And asked of thee, and thou hast answered--but
    Only to thus much: while I speak, he sinks--                        30
    Is gone--and leaves his beauty, not his knowledge,
    To the delighted West, which revels in
    Its hues of dying glory. Yet what is
    Death, so it be but glorious? 'Tis a sunset;
    And mortals may be happy to resemble
    The Gods but in decay.

                    _Enter_ ARBACES _by an inner door_.

    _Arb._                Beleses, why
    So wrapt in thy devotions? Dost thou stand
    Gazing to trace thy disappearing God
    Into some realm of undiscovered day?
    Our business is with night--'tis come.

    _Bel._                               But not                        40
    Gone.

    _Arb._    Let it roll on--we are ready.

    _Bel._                                 Yes.
    Would it were over!

    _Arb._              Does the prophet doubt,
    To whom the very stars shine Victory?

    _Bel._ I do not doubt of Victory--but the Victor.

    _Arb._ Well, let thy science settle that. Meantime
    I have prepared as many glittering spears
    As will out-sparkle our allies--your planets.
    There is no more to thwart us. The she-king,
    That less than woman, is even now upon
    The waters with his female mates. The order                         50
    Is issued for the feast in the pavilion.
    The first cup which he drains will be the last
    Quaffed by the line of Nimrod.

    _Bel._                         'Twas a brave one.

    _Arb._ And is a weak one--'tis worn out--we'll mend it.

    _Bel._ Art sure of that?

    _Arb._                    Its founder was a hunter--
    I am a soldier--what is there to fear?

    _Bel._ The soldier.

    _Arb._              And the priest, it may be: but
    If you thought thus, or think, why not retain
    Your king of concubines? why stir me up?
    Why spur me to this enterprise? your own                            60
    No less than mine?

    _Bel._            Look to the sky!

    _Arb._                            I look.

    _Bel._ What seest thou?

    _Arb._                  A fair summer's twilight, and
    The gathering of the stars.

    _Bel._                      And midst them, mark
    Yon earliest, and the brightest, which so quivers,
    As it would quit its place in the blue ether.

    _Arb._ Well?

    _Bel._      'Tis thy natal ruler--thy birth planet.

    _Arb._ (_touching his scabbard_).
    My star is in this scabbard: when it shines,
    It shall out-dazzle comets. Let us think
    Of what is to be done to justify
    Thy planets and their portents. When we conquer,                    70
    They shall have temples--aye, and priests--and thou
    Shalt be the pontiff of--what Gods thou wilt;
    For I observe that they are ever just,
    And own the bravest for the most devout.

    _Bel._ Aye, and the most devout for brave--thou hast not
    Seen me turn back from battle.

    _Arb._                         No; I own thee
    As firm in fight as Babylonia's captain,
    As skilful in Chaldea's worship: now,
    Will it but please thee to forget the priest,
    And be the warrior?

    _Bel._              Why not both?

    _Arb._                           The better;                        80
    And yet it almost shames me, we shall have
    So little to effect. This woman's warfare
    Degrades the very conqueror. To have plucked
    A bold and bloody despot from his throne,
    And grappled with him, clashing steel with steel,
    That were heroic or to win or fall;
    But to upraise my sword against this silkworm,[15]
    And hear him whine, it may be----

    _Bel._                           Do not deem it:
    He has that in him which may make you strife yet;
    And were he all you think, his guards are hardy,                    90
    And headed by the cool, stern Salemenes.

    _Arb._ They'll not resist.

    _Bel._                     Why not? they are soldiers.

    _Arb._                                                True,
    And therefore need a soldier to command them.

    _Bel._ That Salemenes is.

    _Arb._                    But not their King.
    Besides, he hates the effeminate thing that governs,
    For the Queen's sake, his sister. Mark you not
    He keeps aloof from all the revels?

    _Bel._                              But
    Not from the council--there he is ever constant.

    _Arb._ And ever thwarted: what would you have more
    To make a rebel out of? A fool reigning,                           100
    His blood dishonoured, and himself disdained:
    Why, it is _his_ revenge we work for.

    _Bel._                               Could
    He but be brought to think so: this I doubt of.

    _Arb._ What, if we sound him?

    _Bel._                       Yes--if the time served.

                              _Enter_ BALEA.

    _Bal._ Satraps! The king commands your presence at
    The feast to-night.

    _Bel._              To hear is to obey.
    In the pavilion?

    _Bal._           No; here in the palace.

    _Arb._ How! in the palace? it was not thus ordered.

    _Bal._ It is so ordered now.

    _Arb._                        And why?

    _Bal._                                I know not.
    May I retire?

    _Arb._       Stay.

    _Bel._ (_to Arb. aside_). Hush! let him go his way.                110
    (_Alternately to Bal._) Yes, Balea, thank the Monarch, kiss the hem
    Of his imperial robe, and say, his slaves
    Will take the crumbs he deigns to scatter from
    His royal table at the hour--was't midnight?

    _Bal._ It was: the place, the hall of Nimrod. Lords,
    I humble me before you, and depart.                     [_Exit_ BALEA.

    _Arb._ I like not this same sudden change of place;
    There is some mystery: wherefore should he change it?

    _Bel._ Doth he not change a thousand times a day?
    Sloth is of all things the most fanciful--                         120
    And moves more parasangs in its intents
    Than generals in their marches, when they seek
    To leave their foe at fault.--Why dost thou muse?

    _Arb._ He loved that gay pavilion,--it was ever
    His summer dotage.

    _Bel._             And he loved his Queen--
    And thrice a thousand harlotry besides--
    And he has loved all things by turns, except
    Wisdom and Glory.

    _Arb._            Still--I like it not.
    If he has changed--why, so must we: the attack
    Were easy in the isolated bower,                                   130
    Beset with drowsy guards and drunken courtiers;
    But in the hall of Nimrod----

    _Bel._                         Is it so?
    Methought the haughty soldier feared to mount
    A throne too easily--does it disappoint thee
    To find there is a slipperier step or two
    Than what was counted on?

    _Arb._                    When the hour comes,
    Thou shall perceive how far I fear or no.
    Thou hast seen my life at stake--and gaily played for:
    But here is more upon the die--a kingdom.

    _Bel._ I have foretold already--thou wilt win it:                  140
    Then on, and prosper.

    _Arb._                Now were I a soothsayer,
    I would have boded so much to myself.
    But be the stars obeyed--I cannot quarrel
    With them, nor their interpreter. Who's here?

                            _Enter_ SALEMENES.

    _Sal._ Satraps!

    _Bel._            My Prince!

    _Sal._                     Well met--I sought ye both,
    But elsewhere than the palace.

    _Arb._                         Wherefore so?

    _Sal._ 'Tis not the hour.

    _Arb._                    The hour!--what hour?

    _Sal._                                         Of midnight.

    _Bel._ Midnight, my Lord!

    _Sal._                     What, are you not invited?

    _Bel._ Oh! yes--we had forgotten.

    _Sal._                             Is it usual
    Thus to forget a Sovereign's invitation?

    _Arb._ Why--we but now received it.                                150

    _Sal._                              Then why here?

    _Arb._ On duty.

    _Sal._           On what duty?

    _Bel._                         On the state's.
    We have the privilege to approach the presence;
    But found the Monarch absent.[k]

    _Sal._                        And I too
    Am upon duty.

    _Arb._       May we crave its purport?

    _Sal._ To arrest two traitors. Guards! Within there!

                             _Enter Guards_.

    _Sal._ (_continuing_).                              Satraps,
    Your swords.

    _Bel._ (_delivering his_). My lord, behold my scimitar.

    _Arb._ (_drawing his sword_). Take mine.

    _Sal._ (_advancing_).                     I will.

    _Arb._                             But in your heart the blade--
    The hilt quits not this hand.[l]

    _Sal._ (_drawing_).         How! dost thou brave me?
    Tis well--this saves a trial, and false mercy.                     160
    Soldiers, hew down the rebel!

    _Arb._                        Soldiers! Aye--
    _Alone, you_ dare not.

    _Sal._                Alone! foolish slave--
    What is there in thee that a Prince should shrink from
    Of open force? We dread thy treason, not
    Thy strength: thy tooth is nought without its venom--
    The serpent's, not the lion's. Cut him down.

    _Bel._ (_interposing_). Arbaces! Are you mad? Have I not rendered
    _My_ sword? Then trust like me our Sovereign's justice.

    _Arb._   No--I will sooner trust the stars thou prat'st of,
    And this slight arm, and die a king at least                       170
    Of my own breath and body--so far that
    None else shall chain them.

    _Sal._ (_to the Guards_).     You hear _him_ and _me_.
    Take him not,--kill.

                        [_The Guards attack_ ARBACES, _who defends himself
                            valiantly and dexterously till they waver_.

    _Sal._                   Is it even so; and must
    I do the hangman's office? Recreants! see
    How you should fell a traitor.
                                             [SALEMENES _attacks_ ARBACES.

                    _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _and Train_.

    _Sar._                         Hold your hands--
    Upon your lives, I say. What, deaf or drunken?
    My sword! O fool, I wear no sword: here, fellow,
    Give me thy weapon.                                     [_To a Guard_.

                 [SARDANAPALUS _snatches a sword from one of the soldiers,
                     and rushes between the combatants--they separate_.

    _Sar._             In my very palace!
    What hinders me from cleaving you in twain,
    Audacious brawlers?

    _Bel._              Sire, your justice.

    _Sal._                                 Or--                        180
    Your weakness.

    _Sar._ (_raising the sword_). How?

    _Sal._             Strike! so the blow's repeated
    Upon yon traitor--whom you spare a moment,
    I trust, for torture--I'm content.

    _Sar._                             What--him!
    Who dares assail Arbaces?

    _Sal._                    I!

    _Sar._                      Indeed!
    Prince, you forget yourself. Upon what warrant?

    _Sal._ (_showing the signet_). Thine.

    _Arb._ (_confused_).               The King's!

    _Sal._ Yes! and let the King confirm it.

    _Sar._ I parted not from this for such a purpose.

    _Sal._ You parted with it for your safety--I
    Employed it for the best. Pronounce in person.
    Here I am but your slave--a moment past                            190
    I was your representative.

    _Sar._                     Then sheathe
    Your swords.
           [ARBACES _and_ SALEMENES _return their swords to the scabbards_.

    _Sal._ Mine's sheathed: I pray you sheathe _not_ yours:
    Tis the sole sceptre left you now with safety.

    _Sar._ A heavy one; the hilt, too, hurts my hand.
    (_To a Guard_.) Here, fellow, take thy weapon back. Well, sirs,
    What doth this mean?

    _Bel._               The Prince must answer that.

    _Sal._ Truth upon my part, treason upon theirs.

    _Sar._ Treason--Arbaces! treachery and Beleses!
    That were an union I will not believe.

    _Bel._ Where is the proof?

    _Sal._                          I'll answer that, if once          200
    The king demands your fellow-traitor's sword.

    _Arb._ (_to Sal._). A sword which hath been drawn as oft as thine
    Against his foes.

    _Sal._          And now against his brother,
    And in an hour or so against himself.

    _Sar._ That is not possible: he dared not; no--
    No--I'll not hear of such things. These vain bickerings
    Are spawned in courts by base intrigues, and baser
    Hirelings, who live by lies on good men's lives.
    You must have been deceived, my brother.

    _Sal._                                   First
    Let him deliver up his weapon, and                                 210
    Proclaim himself your subject by that duty,
    And I will answer all.

    _Sar._                 Why, if I thought so--
    But no, it cannot be: the Mede Arbaces--
    The trusty, rough, true soldier--the best captain
    Of all who discipline our nations----No,
    I'll not insult him thus, to bid him render
    The scimitar to me he never yielded
    Unto our enemies. Chief, keep your weapon.

    _Sal._ (_delivering back the signet_).
    Monarch, take back your signet.

    _Sar._                          No, retain it;
    But use it with more moderation.

    _Sal._                          Sire,                             200
    I used it for your honour, and restore it
    Because I cannot keep it with my own.
    Bestow it on Arbaces.

    _Sar._                So I should:
    He never asked it.

    _Sal._             Doubt not, he will have it,
    Without that hollow semblance of respect.

    _Bel._ I know not what hath prejudiced the Prince
    So strongly 'gainst two subjects, than whom none
    Have been more zealous for Assyria's weal.

    _Sal._ Peace, factious priest, and faithless soldier! thou
    Unit'st in thy own person the worst vices                          230
    Of the most dangerous orders of mankind.
    Keep thy smooth words and juggling homilies
    For those who know thee not. Thy fellow's sin
    Is, at the least, a bold one, and not tempered
    By the tricks taught thee in Chaldea.

    _Bel._                                Hear him,
    My liege--the son of Belus! he blasphemes
    The worship of the land, which bows the knee
    Before your fathers.

    _Sar._               Oh! for that I pray you
    Let him have absolution. I dispense with
    The worship of dead men; feeling that I                            240
    Am mortal, and believing that the race
    From whence I sprung are--what I see them--ashes.

    _Bel._ King! Do not deem so: they are with the stars,
    And----

    _Sar._  You shall join them ere they will rise,
    If you preach farther--Why, _this_ is rank treason.

    _Sal._ My lord!

    _Sar._          To school me in the worship of
    Assyria's idols! Let him be released--
    Give him his sword.

    _Sal._              My Lord, and King, and Brother,
    I pray ye pause.

    _Sar._           Yes, and be sermonised,
    And dinned, and deafened with dead men and Baal,                   250
    And all Chaldea's starry mysteries.

    _Bel._ Monarch! respect them.

    _Sar._                       Oh! for that--I love them;
    I love to watch them in the deep blue vault,
    And to compare them with my Myrrha's eyes;
    I love to see their rays redoubled in
    The tremulous silver of Euphrates' wave,
    As the light breeze of midnight crisps the broad
    And rolling water, sighing through the sedges
    Which fringe his banks: but whether they may be
    Gods, as some say, or the abodes of Gods,                          260
    As others hold, or simply lamps of night,
    Worlds--or the lights of Worlds--I know nor care not.
    There's something sweet in my uncertainty
    I would not change for your Chaldean lore;
    Besides, I know of these all clay can know
    Of aught above it, or below it--nothing.
    I see their brilliancy and feel their beauty[m]--
    When they shine on my grave I shall know neither.

    _Bel._ For _neither_, Sire, say _better_.

    _Sar._                                   I will wait,
    If it so please you, Pontiff, for that knowledge.                  270
    In the mean time receive your sword, and know
    That I prefer your service militant
    Unto your ministry--not loving either.

    _Sal._ (_aside_). His lusts have made him mad. Then must I save him,
    Spite of himself.

    _Sar._            Please you to hear me, Satraps!
    And chiefly thou, my priest, because I doubt thee
    More than the soldier; and would doubt thee all
    Wert thou not half a warrior: let us part
    In peace--I'll not say pardon--which must be
    Earned by the guilty; this I'll not pronounce ye,                  280
    Although upon this breath of mine depends
    Your own; and, deadlier for ye, on my fears.
    But fear not--for that I am soft, not fearful--
    And so live on. Were I the thing some think me,
    Your heads would now be dripping the last drops
    Of their attainted gore from the high gates
    Of this our palace, into the dry dust,
    Their only portion of the coveted kingdom
    They would be crowned to reign o'er--let that pass.
    As I have said, I will not _deem_ ye guilty,                       290
    Nor _doom_ ye guiltless. Albeit better men
    Than ye or I stand ready to arraign you;
    And should I leave your fate to sterner judges,
    And proofs of all kinds, I might sacrifice
    Two men, who, whatsoe'er they now are, were
    Once honest. Ye are free, sirs.

    _Arb._                          Sire, this clemency----

    _Bel._ (_interrupting him_).
    Is worthy of yourself; and, although innocent,
    We thank----

    _Sar._      Priest! keep your thanksgivings for Belus;
    His offspring needs none.

    _Bel._                    But being innocent----

    _Sar._ Be silent.--Guilt is loud. If ye are loyal,                 300
    Ye are injured men, and should be sad, not grateful.

    _Bel._ So we should be, were justice always done
    By earthly power omnipotent; but Innocence
    Must oft receive her right as a mere favour.

    _Sar._ That's a good sentence for a homily,
    Though not for this occasion. Prithee keep it
    To plead thy Sovereign's cause before his people.

    _Bel._ I trust there is no cause.

    _Sar._                             No _cause_, perhaps;
    But many causers:--if ye meet with such
    In the exercise of your inquisitive function                       310
    On earth, or should you read of it in heaven
    In some mysterious twinkle of the stars,
    Which are your chronicles, I pray you note,
    That there are worse things betwixt earth and heaven
    Than him who ruleth many and slays none;
    And, hating not himself, yet loves his fellows
    Enough to spare even those who would not spare him
    Were they once masters--but that's doubtful. Satraps!
    Your swords and persons are at liberty
    To use them as ye will--but from this hour                         320
    I have no call for either. Salemenes!
    Follow me.

                  [_Exeunt_ SARDANAPALUS, SALEMENES, _and the Train, etc.,
                      leaving_ ARBACES _and_ BELESES.

    _Arb._        Beleses!

    _Bel._                 Now, what think you?

    _Arb._ That we are lost.

    _Bel._                 That we have won the kingdom.

    _Arb._ What? thus suspected--with the sword slung o'er us
    But by a single hair, and that still wavering,
    To be blown down by his imperious breath
    Which spared us--why, I know not.

    _Bel._                            Seek not why;
    But let us profit by the interval.[n]
    The hour is still our own--our power the same--
    The night the same we destined. He hath changed                    330
    Nothing except our ignorance of all
    Suspicion into such a certainty
    As must make madness of delay.

    _Arb._                        And yet--

    _Bel._ What, doubting still?

    _Arb._                      He spared our lives, nay, more,
    Saved them from Salemenes.

    _Bel._                     And how long
    Will he so spare? till the first drunken minute.

    _Arb._ Or sober, rather. Yet he did it nobly;
    Gave royally what we had forfeited
    Basely----

    _Bel._    Say bravely.

    _Arb._                 Somewhat of both, perhaps--
    But it has touched me, and, whate'er betide,                       340
    I will no further on.

    _Bel._                And lose the world!

    _Arb._ Lose any thing except my own esteem.

    _Bel._ I blush that we should owe our lives to such
    A king of distaffs!

    _Arb._              But no less we owe them;
    And I should blush far more to take the grantor's![16]

    _Bel._ Thou may'st endure whate'er thou wilt--the stars
    Have written otherwise.

    _Arb._                  Though they came down,
    And marshalled me the way in all their brightness,
    I would not follow.

    _Bel._             This is weakness--worse
    Than a scared beldam's dreaming of the dead,                       350
    And waking in the dark.--Go to--go to.

    _Arb._ Methought he looked like Nimrod as he spoke,
    Even as the proud imperial statue stands
    Looking the monarch of the kings around it,
    And sways, while they but ornament, the temple.

    _Bel._ I told you that you had too much despised him,
    And that there was some royalty within him--What
    then? he is the nobler foe.

    _Arb._                     But we
    The meaner.--Would he had not spared us!

    _Bel._                                   So--
    Wouldst thou be sacrificed thus readily?                           360

    _Arb._ No--but it had been better to have died
    Than live ungrateful.

    _Bel._                Oh, the souls of some men!
    Thou wouldst digest what some call treason, and
    Fools treachery--and, behold, upon the sudden,
    Because for something or for nothing, this
    Rash reveller steps, ostentatiously,
    'Twixt thee and Salemenes, thou art turned
    Into--what shall I say?--Sardanapalus!
    I know no name more ignominious.

    _Arb._                           But
    An hour ago, who dared to term me such                             370
    Had held his life but lightly--as it is,
    I must forgive you, even as he forgave us--
    Semiramis herself would not have done it.

    _Bel._ No--the Queen liked no sharers of the kingdom,
    Not even a husband.[17]

    _Arb._              I must serve him truly----

    _Bel._ And humbly?

    _Arb._               No, sir, proudly--being honest.
    I shall be nearer thrones than you to heaven;
    And if not quite so haughty, yet more lofty.
    You may do your own deeming--you have codes,
    And mysteries, and corollaries of                                  380
    Right and wrong, which I lack for my direction,
    And must pursue but what a plain heart teaches.
    And now you know me.

    _Bel._               Have you finished?

    _Arb._                                 Yes--
    With you.

    _Bel._    And would, perhaps, betray as well
    As quit me?

    _Arb._       That's a sacerdotal thought,
    And not a soldier's.

    _Bel._               Be it what you will--
    Truce with these wranglings, and but hear me.

    _Arb._                                        No--
    There is more peril in your subtle spirit
    Than in a phalanx.

    _Bel._            If it must be so--
    I'll on alone.

    _Arb._         Alone!

    _Bel._               Thrones hold but one.                         390

    _Arb._ But this is filled.

    _Bel._                      With worse than vacancy--
    A despised monarch. Look to it, Arbaces:
    I have still aided, cherished, loved, and urged you;
    Was willing even to serve you, in the hope
    To serve and save Assyria. Heaven itself
    Seemed to consent, and all events were friendly,
    Even to the last, till that your spirit shrunk
    Into a shallow softness; but now, rather
    Than see my country languish, I will be
    Her saviour or the victim of her tyrant--                          400
    Or one or both--for sometimes both are one;
    And if I win--Arbaces is my servant.

    _Arb._ _Your_ servant!

    _Bel._                Why not? better than be slave,
    The _pardoned_ slave of _she_ Sardanapalus!

                              _Enter_ PANIA.

    _Pan._ My Lords, I bear an order from the king.

    _Arb._ It is obeyed ere spoken.

    _Bel._                          Notwithstanding,
    Let's hear it.

    _Pan._         Forthwith, on this very night,
    Repair to your respective satrapies
    Of Babylon and Media.

    _Bel._                With our troops?

    _Pan._ My order is unto the Satraps and                            410
    Their household train.

    _Arb._                But----

    _Bel._                        It must be obeyed:
    Say, we depart.

    _Pan._          My order is to see you
    Depart, and not to bear your answer.

    _Bel._ (_aside_).                   Aye[o]!
    Well, Sir--we will accompany you hence.

    _Pan._ I will retire to marshal forth the guard
    Of honour which befits your rank, and wait
    Your leisure, so that it the hour exceeds not.
                                                            [_Exit_ PANIA.

    _Bel._ Now then obey!

    _Arb._                Doubtless.

    _Bel._                           Yes, to the gates
    That grate the palace, which is now our prison--
    No further.

    _Arb._   Thou hast harped the truth indeed!                        420
    The realm itself, in all its wide extension,
    Yawns dungeons at each step for thee and me.

    _Bel._ Graves!

    _Arb._         If I thought so, this good sword should dig
    One more than mine.

    _Bel._              It shall have work enough.
    Let me hope better than thou augurest;
    At present, let us hence as best we may.
    Thou dost agree with me in understanding
    This order as a sentence?

    _Arb._                    Why, what other
    Interpretation should it bear? it is
    The very policy of Orient monarchs--                               430
    Pardon and poison--favours and a sword--
    A distant voyage, and an eternal sleep.
    How many Satraps in his father's time--
    For he I own is, or at least _was_, bloodless--

    _Bel._ But _will_ not--_can_ not be so now.

    _Arb._                                     I doubt it.
    How many Satraps have I seen set out
    In his Sire's day for mighty Vice-royalties,
    Whose tombs are on their path! I know not how,
    But they all sickened by the way, it was
    So long and heavy.

    _Bel._             Let us but regain                               440
    The free air of the city, and we'll shorten
    The journey.

    _Arb._      'Twill be shortened at the gates,
    It may be.

    _Bel._    No; they hardly will risk that.
    They mean us to die privately, but not
    Within the palace or the city walls,
    Where we are known, and may have partisans:
    If they had meant to slay us here, we were
    No longer with the living. Let us hence.

    _Arb._ If I but thought he did not mean my life--

    _Bel._ Fool! hence--what else should despotism alarmed             450
    Mean? Let us but rejoin our troops, and march.

    _Arb._ Towards our provinces?

    _Bel._                        No; towards your kingdom.
    There's time--there's heart, and hope, and power, and means--
    Which their half measures leave us in full scope.--
    Away!

    _Arb._ And I even yet repenting must
    Relapse to guilt!

    _Bel._            Self-defence is a virtue,
    Sole bulwark of all right. Away, I say!
    Let's leave this place, the air grows thick and choking,
    And the walls have a scent of night-shade--hence!
    Let us not leave them time for further council.                    460
    Our quick departure proves our civic zeal;
    Our quick departure hinders our good escort,
    The worthy Pania, from anticipating
    The orders of some parasangs from hence:
    Nay, there's no other choice, but----hence, I say[p].
                          [_Exit with_ ARBACES, _who follows reluctantly_.

                  _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _and_ SALEMENES.

    _Sar._ Well, all is remedied, and without bloodshed,
    That worst of mockeries of a remedy;
    We are now secure by these men's exile.

    _Sal._                                  Yes,
    As he who treads on flowers is from the adder
    Twined round their roots.

    _Sar._                    Why, what wouldst have me do?            470

    _Sal._ Undo what you have done.

    _Sar._                           Revoke my pardon?

    _Sal._ Replace the crown now tottering on your temples.

    _Sar._ That were tyrannical.

    _Sal._                       But sure.

    _Sar._                                 We are so.
    What danger can they work upon the frontier?

    _Sal._ They are not there yet--never should they be so,
    Were I well listened to.

    _Sar._                   Nay, I _have_ listened
    Impartially to thee--why not to them?

    _Sal._ You may know that hereafter; as it is,
    I take my leave to order forth the guard.

    _Sar._ And you will join us at the banquet?

    _Sal._                                      Sire,                  480
    Dispense with me--I am no wassailer:
    Command me in all service save the Bacchant's.

    _Sar._ Nay, but 'tis fit to revel now and then.

    _Sal._ And fit that some should watch for those who revel
    Too oft. Am I permitted to depart?

    _Sar._ Yes----Stay a moment, my good Salemenes,
    My brother--my best subject--better Prince
    Than I am King. You should have been the monarch,
    And I--I know not what, and care not; but
    Think not I am insensible to all                                   490
    Thine honest wisdom, and thy rough yet kind,
    Though oft-reproving sufferance of my follies.
    If I have spared these men against thy counsel,
    That is, their lives--it is not that I doubt
    The advice was sound; but, let them live: we will not
    Cavil about their lives--so let them mend them.
    Their banishment will leave me still sound sleep,
    Which their death had not left me.

    _Sal._                             Thus you run
    The risk to sleep for ever, to save traitors--
    A moment's pang now changed for years of crime.                    500
    Still let them be made quiet.

    _Sar._                        Tempt me not;
    My word is past.

    _Sal._           But it may be recalled.

    _Sar._ 'Tis royal.

    _Sal._              And should therefore be decisive.
    This half-indulgence of an exile serves
    But to provoke--a pardon should be full,
    Or it is none.

    _Sar._         And who persuaded me
    After I had repealed them, or at least
    Only dismissed them from our presence, who
    Urged me to send them to their satrapies?

    _Sal._ True; that I had forgotten; that is, Sire,                  510
    If they e'er reached their Satrapies--why, then,
    Reprove me more for my advice.

    _Sar._                        And if
    They do not reach them--look to it!--in safety,
    In safety, mark me--and security--
    Look to thine own.

    _Sal._             Permit me to depart;
    Their _safety_ shall be cared for.

    _Sar._                            Get thee hence, then;
    And, prithee, think more gently of thy brother.

    _Sal._ Sire, I shall ever duly serve my sovereign.
                                                        [_Exit_ SALEMENES.

    _Sar._ (_solus_). That man is of a temper too severe;
    Hard but as lofty as the rock, and free                            520
    From all the taints of common earth--while I
    Am softer clay, impregnated with flowers:
    But as our mould is, must the produce be.
    If I have erred this time, 'tis on the side
    Where Error sits most lightly on that sense,
    I know not what to call it; but it reckons
    With me ofttimes for pain, and sometimes pleasure;
    A spirit which seems placed about my heart
    To count its throbs, not quicken them, and ask
    Questions which mortal never dared to ask me,                      530
    Nor Baal, though an oracular deity--[q]
    Albeit his marble face majestical
    Frowns as the shadows of the evening dim
    His brows to changed expression, till at times
    I think the statue looks in act to speak.
    Away with these vain thoughts, I will be joyous--
    And here comes Joy's true herald.

                             _Enter_ MYRRHA.

    _Myr._                           King! the sky
    Is overcast, and musters muttering thunder,
    In clouds that seem approaching fast, and show
    In forked flashes a commanding tempest.[r]                         540
    Will you then quit the palace?

    _Sar._                        Tempest, say'st thou?

    _Myr._ Aye, my good lord.

    _Sar._                    For my own part, I should be
    Not ill content to vary the smooth scene,
    And watch the warring elements; but this
    Would little suit the silken garments and
    Smooth faces of our festive friends. Say, Myrrha,
    Art thou of those who dread the roar of clouds?

    _Myr._ In my own country we respect their voices
    As auguries of Jove.[s]

    _Sar._              Jove!--aye, your Baal--
    Ours also has a property in thunder,                               550
    And ever and anon some falling bolt
    Proves his divinity,--and yet sometimes
    Strikes his own altars.

    _Myr._                  That were a dread omen.

    _Sar._ Yes--for the priests. Well, we will not go forth
    Beyond the palace walls to-night, but make
    Our feast within.

    _Myr._             Now, Jove be praised! that he
    Hath heard the prayer thou wouldst not hear. The Gods
    Are kinder to thee than thou to thyself,
    And flash this storm between thee and thy foes,
    To shield thee from them.

    _Sar._                   Child, if there be peril,                 560
    Methinks it is the same within these walls
    As on the river's brink.

    _Myr._                   Not so; these walls
    Are high and strong, and guarded. Treason has
    To penetrate through many a winding way,
    And massy portal; but in the pavilion
    There is no bulwark.

    _Sar._               No, nor in the palace,
    Nor in the fortress, nor upon the top
    Of cloud-fenced Caucasus, where the eagle sits
    Nested in pathless clefts, if treachery be:
    Even as the arrow finds the airy king,                             570
    The steel will reach the earthly. But be calm;
    The men, or innocent or guilty, are
    Banished, and far upon their way.

    _Myr._                            They live, then?

    _Sar._ So sanguinary? _Thou!_

    _Myr._                      I would not shrink
    From just infliction of due punishment
    On those who seek your life: were't otherwise,
    I should not merit mine. Besides, you heard
    The princely Salemenes.

    _Sar._                  This is strange;
    The gentle and the austere are both against me,
    And urge me to revenge.

    _Myr._                 'Tis a Greek virtue.                        580

    _Sar._ But not a kingly one--I'll none on't; or
    If ever I indulge in't, it shall be
    With kings--my equals.

    _Myr._                 These men sought to be so.

    _Sar._ Myrrha, this is too feminine, and springs
    From fear----

    _Myr._       For you.

    _Sar._               No matter, still 'tis fear.
    I have observed your sex, once roused to wrath,
    Are timidly vindictive to a pitch
    Of perseverance, which I would not copy.
    I thought you were exempt from this, as from
    The childish helplessness of Asian women[t].                       590

    _Myr._ My Lord, I am no boaster of my love,
    Nor of my attributes; I have shared your splendour,
    And will partake your fortunes. You may live
    To find one slave more true than subject myriads:
    But this the Gods avert! I am content
    To be beloved on trust for what I feel,
    Rather than prove it to you in your griefs[u],
    Which might not yield to any cares of mine.

    _Sar._ Grief cannot come where perfect love exists,
    Except to heighten it, and vanish from                             600
    That which it could not scare away. Let's in--
    The hour approaches, and we must prepare
    To meet the invited guests who grace our feast.
                                                                [_Exeunt_.




                                 ACT III.


       SCENE I.--_The Hall of the Palace illuminated_--SARDANAPALUS
         _and his Guests at Table.--A storm without, and Thunder
         occasionally heard during the Banquet_.

    _Sar._ Fill full! why this is as it should be: here
    Is my true realm, amidst bright eyes and faces
    Happy as fair! Here sorrow cannot reach.

    _Zam._ Nor elsewhere--where the King is, pleasure sparkles.

    _Sar._ Is not this better now than Nimrod's huntings,
    Or my wild Grandam's chase in search of kingdoms
    She could not keep when conquered?

    _Alt._                            Mighty though
    They were, as all thy royal line have been,
    Yet none of those who went before have reached
    The acme of Sardanapalus, who                                       10
    Has placed his joy in peace--the sole true glory.

    _Sar._ And pleasure, good Altada, to which glory
    Is but the path. What is it that we seek?
    Enjoyment! We have cut the way short to it,
    And not gone tracking it through human ashes,
    Making a grave with every footstep.

    _Zam._                             No;
    All hearts are happy, and all voices bless
    The King of peace--who holds a world in jubilee.

    _Sar._ Art sure of that? I have heard otherwise;
    Some say that there be traitors.

    _Zam._                           Traitors they                      20
    Who dare to say so!--'Tis impossible.
    What cause?

    _Sar._      What cause? true,--fill the goblet up;
    We will not think of them: there are none such,
    Or if there be, they are gone.

    _Alt._                         Guests, to my pledge!
    Down on your knees, and drink a measure to
    The safety of the King--the monarch, say I?
    The God Sardanapalus!
                              [ZAMES _and the Guests kneel, and exclaim_--
                          Mightier than
    His father Baal, the God Sardanapalus!
                 [_It thunders as they kneel; some start up in confusion_.

    _Zam._ Why do you rise, my friends? in that strong peal
    His father gods consented.

    _Myr._                     Menaced, rather.                         30
    King, wilt thou bear this mad impiety?

    _Sar._ Impiety!--nay, if the sires who reigned
    Before me can be Gods, I'll not disgrace
    Their lineage. But arise, my pious friends;
    Hoard your devotion for the Thunderer there:
    I seek but to be loved, not worshipped.

    _Alt._                                 Both--
    Both you must ever be by all true subjects.

    _Sar._ Methinks the thunders still increase: it is
    An awful night.

    _Myr._          Oh yes, for those who have
    No palace to protect their worshippers.                             40

    _Sar._ That's true, my Myrrha; and could I convert
    My realm to one wide shelter for the wretched,
    I'd do it.

    _Myr._   Thou'rt no God, then--not to be
    Able to work a will so good and general,
    As thy wish would imply.

    _Sar._                   And your Gods, then,
    Who can, and do not?

    _Myr._               Do not speak of that,
    Lest we provoke them.

    _Sar._                True--, they love not censure
    Better than mortals. Friends, a thought has struck me:
    Were there no temples, would there, think ye, be
    Air worshippers?[v] that is, when it is angry,                      50
    And pelting as even now.

    _Myr._                 The Persian prays
    Upon his mountain.

    _Sar._             Yes, when the Sun shines.

    _Myr._ And I would ask if this your palace were
    Unroofed and desolate, how many flatterers
    Would lick the dust in which the King lay low?

    _Alt._ The fair Ionian is too sarcastic
    Upon a nation whom she knows not well;
    The Assyrians know no pleasure but their King's,
    And homage is their pride.

    _Sar._                     Nay, pardon, guests,
    The fair Greek's readiness of speech.

    _Alt._                               _Pardon!_ sire:                60
    We honour her of all things next to thee.
    Hark! what was that?

    _Zam._               That! nothing but the jar
    Of distant portals shaken by the wind.

    _Alt._ It sounded like the clash of--hark again!

    _Zam._ The big rain pattering on the roof.

    _Sar._                                      No more.
    Myrrha, my love, hast thou thy shell in order?
    Sing me a song of Sappho[18]; her, thou know'st,
    Who in thy country threw----

           _Enter_ PANIA, _with his sword and garments bloody,
              and disordered. The guests rise in confusion_.

    _Pan._ (_to the Guards_).  Look to the portals;
    And with your best speed to the walls without.
    Your arms! To arms! The King's in danger. Monarch                   70
    Excuse this haste,--'tis faith.

    _Sar._                          Speak on.

    _Pan._                                   It is
    As Salemenes feared; the faithless Satraps----

    _Sar._ You are wounded--give some wine. Take breath, good Pania.

    _Pan._ 'Tis nothing--a mere flesh wound. I am worn
    More with my speed to warn my sovereign,
    Than hurt in his defence.

    _Myr._                    Well, Sir, the rebels?

    _Pan._ Soon as Arbaces and Beleses reached
    Their stations in the city, they refused
    To march; and on my attempt to use the power
    Which I was delegated with, they called                             80
    Upon their troops, who rose in fierce defiance.

    _Myr._ All?

    _Pan._     Too many.

    _Sar._              Spare not of thy free speech,
    To spare mine ears--the truth.

    _Pan._                       My own slight guard
    Were faithful, and what's left of it is still so.

    _Myr._ And are these all the force still faithful?

    _Pan._                                            No--
    The Bactrians, now led on by Salemenes,
    Who even then was on his way, still urged
    By strong suspicion of the Median chiefs,
    Are numerous, and make strong head against
    The rebels, fighting inch by inch, and forming                      90
    An orb around the palace, where they mean
    To centre all their force, and save the King.
    (_He hesitates_.) I am charged to----

    _Myr._                            'Tis no time for hesitation.

    _Pan._ Prince Salemenes doth implore the King
    To arm himself, although but for a moment,
    And show himself unto the soldiers: his
    Sole presence in this instant might do more
    Than hosts can do in his behalf.

    _Sar._                           What, ho!
    My armour there.

    _Myr._           And wilt thou?

    _Sar._                         Will I not?
    Ho, there!--but seek not for the buckler: 'tis                     100
    Too heavy:--a light cuirass and my sword.
    Where are the rebels?

    _Pan._                Scarce a furlong's length
    From the outward wall the fiercest conflict rages.

    _Sar._ Then I may charge on horseback. Sfero, ho!
    Order my horse out.--There is space enough
    Even in our courts, and by the outer gate,
    To marshal half the horsemen of Arabia.
                                          [_Exit_ SFERO _for the armour_.

    _Myr._ How I do love thee!

    _Sar._                     I ne'er doubted it.

    _Myr._ But now I know thee.

    _Sar._ (_to his Attendant_). Bring down my spear too--
    Where's Salemenes?

    _Pan._             Where a soldier should be,                      110
    In the thick of the fight.

    _Sar._                     Then hasten to him----Is
    The path still open, and communication
    Left 'twixt the palace and the phalanx?

    _Pan._                                  'Twas
    When I late left him, and I have no fear;
    Our troops were steady, and the phalanx formed.

    _Sar._ Tell him to spare his person for the present,
    And that I will not spare my own--and say,
    I come.

    _Pan._ There's victory in the very word.                [_Exit_ PANIA.

    _Sar._ Altada--Zames--forth, and arm ye! There
    Is all in readiness in the armoury.                                120
    See that the women are bestowed in safety
    In the remote apartments: let a guard
    Be set before them, with strict charge to quit
    The post but with their lives--command it, Zames.
    Altada, arm yourself, and return here;
    Your post is near our person.
                           [_Exeunt_ ZAMES, ALTADA, _and all save_ MYRRHA.

          _Enter_ SFERO _and others with the King's Arms, etc._

    _Sfe._                     King! your armour.

    _Sar._ (_arming himself_). Give me the cuirass--so: my baldric; now
    My sword: I had forgot the helm--where is it?
    That's well--no, 'tis too heavy; you mistake, too--
    It was not this I meant, but that which bears                      130
    A diadem around it.

    _Sfe._              Sire, I deemed
    That too conspicuous from the precious stones
    To risk your sacred brow beneath--and trust me,
    This is of better metal, though less rich.

    _Sar._ You deemed! Are you too turned a rebel? Fellow!
    Your part is to obey: return, and--no--
    It is too late--I will go forth without it.

    _Sfe._ At least, wear this.

    _Sar._                       Wear Caucasus! why, 'tis
    A mountain on my temples.

    _Sfe._                    Sire, the meanest
    Soldier goes not forth thus exposed to battle.                     140
    All men will recognise you--for the storm
    Has ceased, and the moon breaks forth in her brightness.

    _Sar._ I go forth to be recognised, and thus
    Shall be so sooner. Now--my spear! I'm armed.
                              [_In going stops short, and turns to_ SFERO.
    Sfero--I had forgotten--bring the mirror[19].

    _Sfe._ The mirror, Sire?

    _Sar._                   Yes, sir, of polished brass,
    Brought from the spoils of India--but be speedy.
                                                            [_Exit_ SFERO.

    _Sar._ Myrrha, retire unto a place of safety.
    Why went you not forth with the other damsels?

    _Myr._ Because my place is here.

    _Sar._                           And when I am gone----            150

    _Myr._ I follow.

    _Sar._           _You!_ to battle?

    _Myr._                             If it were so,
    'Twere not the first Greek girl had trod the path.
    I will await here your _return_.

    _Sar._                          The place
    Is spacious, and the first to be sought out,
    If they prevail; and, if it be so,
    And I return not----

    _Myr._               Still we meet again.

    _Sar._ How?

    _Myr._      In the spot where all must meet at last--
    In Hades! if there be, as I believe,
    A shore beyond the Styx; and if there be not,
    In ashes.

    _Sar._    Darest thou so much?

    _Myr._                         I dare all things                   160
    Except survive what I have loved, to be
    A rebel's booty: forth, and do your bravest.

                   _Re-enter_ SFERO _with the mirror_.

    _Sar._ (_looking at himself_).
    This cuirass fits me well, the baldric better,
    And the helm not at all. Methinks I seem
                          [_Flings away the helmet after trying it again_.
    Passing well in these toys; and now to prove them.
    Altada! Where's Altada?

    _Sfe._                  Waiting, Sire,
    Without: he has your shield in readiness.

    _Sar._ True--I forgot--he is my shield-bearer
    By right of blood, derived from age to age.
    Myrrha, embrace me;--yet once more--once more--                    170
    Love me, whate'er betide. My chiefest glory
    Shall be to make me worthier of your love.

    _Myr._ Go forth, and conquer!
                                       [_Exeunt_ SARDANAPALUS _and_ SFERO.
                                 Now, I am alone:
    All are gone forth, and of that all how few
    Perhaps return! Let him but vanquish, and
    Me perish! If he vanquish not, I perish;
    For I will not outlive him. He has wound
    About my heart, I know not how nor why.
    Not for that he is King; for now his kingdom
    Rocks underneath his throne, and the earth yawns                   180
    To yield him no more of it than a grave;
    And yet I love him more. Oh, mighty Jove!
    Forgive this monstrous love for a barbarian,
    Who knows not of Olympus! yes, I love him
    Now--now--far more than----Hark--to the war shout!
    Methinks it nears me. If it should be so,
                                          [_She draws forth a small vial_.
    This cunning Colchian poison, which my father
    Learned to compound on Euxine shores, and taught me
    How to preserve, shall free me! It had freed me
    Long ere this hour, but that I loved until                         190
    I half forgot I was a slave:--where all
    Are slaves save One, and proud of servitude,
    So they are served in turn by something lower
    In the degree of bondage: we forget
    That shackles worn like ornaments no less
    Are chains. Again that shout! and now the clash
    Of arms--and now--and now----

                             _Enter_ ALTADA.

    _Alt._                        Ho, Sfero, ho!

    _Myr._ He is not here; what wouldst thou with him? How
    Goes on the conflict?

    _Alt._                Dubiously and fiercely.

    _Myr._ And the King?

    _Alt._              Like a king. I must find Sfero,                200
    And bring him a new spear with his own helmet.[w]
    He fights till now bare-headed, and by far
    Too much exposed. The soldiers knew his face,
    And the foe too; and in the moon's broad light,
    His silk tiara and his flowing hair
    Make him a mark too royal. Every arrow
    Is pointed at the fair hair and fair features,
    And the broad fillet which crowns both.

    _Myr._                                 Ye Gods,
    Who fulminate o'er my father's land, protect him!
    Were you sent by the King?

    _Alt._                     By Salemenes,                           210
    Who sent me privily upon this charge,
    Without the knowledge of the careless sovereign.
    The King! the King fights as he revels! ho!
    What, Sfero! I will seek the armoury--
    He must be there.                                      [_Exit_ ALTADA.

    _Myr._           'Tis no dishonour--no--
    'Tis no dishonour to have loved this man.
    I almost wish now, what I never wished
    Before--that he were Grecian. If Alcides
    Were shamed in wearing Lydian Omphale's
    She-garb, and wielding her vile distaff; surely                    220
    He, who springs up a Hercules at once,
    Nursed in effeminate arts from youth to manhood,
    And rushes from the banquet to the battle,
    As though it were a bed of love, deserves
    That a Greek girl should be his paramour,
    And a Greek bard his minstrel--a Greek tomb
    His monument. How goes the strife, sir?

                           _Enter an Officer_.

    _Officer_.                            Lost,
    Lost almost past recovery. Zames! Where
    Is Zames?

    _Myr._     Posted with the guard appointed
    To watch before the apartment of the women.                        230
                                                          [_Exit Officer_.

    _Myr._ (_sola_). He's gone; and told no more than that all's lost!
    What need have I to know more? In those words,
    Those little words, a kingdom and a king,
    A line of thirteen ages, and the lives
    Of thousands, and the fortune of all left
    With life, are merged; and I, too, with the great,
    Like a small bubble breaking with the wave
    Which bore it, shall be nothing. At the least,
    My fate is in my keeping: no proud victor
    Shall count me with his spoils.

                              _Enter_ PANIA.

    _Pan._                         Away with me,                       240
    Myrrha, without delay; we must not lose
    A moment--all that's left us now.

    _Myr._                            The King?

    _Pan._ Sent me here to conduct you hence, beyond
    The river, by a secret passage.

    _Myr._                          Then
    He lives----

    _Pan._         And charged me to secure your life,
    And beg you to live on for his sake, till
    He can rejoin you.

    _Myr._             Will he then give way?

    _Pan._ Not till the last. Still, still he does whate'er
    Despair can do; and step by step disputes
    The very palace.

    _Myr._          They are here, then:--aye,                         250
    Their shouts come ringing through the ancient halls,
    Never profaned by rebel echoes till
    This fatal night. Farewell, Assyria's line!
    Farewell to all of Nimrod! Even the name
    Is now no more.

    _Pan._          Away with me--away!

    _Myr._ No: I'll die here!--Away, and tell your King
    I loved him to the last.

          _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _and_ SALEMENES _with Soldiers_.
          PANIA _quits_ MYRRHA, _and ranges himself with them_.

    _Sar._                  Since it is thus,
    We'll die where we were born--in our own halls[x]
    Serry your ranks--stand firm. I have despatched
    A trusty satrap for the guard of Zames,
    All fresh and faithful; they'll be here anon.
    All is not over,--Pania, look to Myrrha.
                                          [PANIA _returns towards_ MYRRHA.

    _Sal._ We have breathing time; yet once more charge, my friends--
    One for Assyria!

    _Sar._           Rather say for Bactria!
    My faithful Bactrians, I will henceforth be
    King of your nation, and we'll hold together
    This realm as province.

    _Sal._                  Hark! they come--they come.

             _Enter_ BELESES _and_ ARBACES _with the Rebels_.

    _Arb._ Set on, we have them in the toil. Charge!
    charge!

    _Bel._ On! on!--Heaven fights for us, and with us--On!

               [_They charge the King and_ SALEMENES _with their troops,
                     who defend themselves till the arrival of_
                     ZAMES _with the Guard before mentioned.
                     The Rebels are then driven off, and pursued by_
                     SALEMENES, _etc. As the King is going to join the
                     pursuit,_ BELESES _crosses him_.

    _Bel._ Ho! tyrant--_I_ will end this war.

    _Sar._                                   Even so,                  270
    My warlike priest, and precious prophet, and
    Grateful and trusty subject: yield, I pray thee.
    I would reserve thee for a fitter doom,
    Rather than dip my hands in holy blood.

    _Bel._ Thine hour is come.

    _Sar._                    No, thine.--I've lately read,
    Though but a young astrologer, the stars;
    And ranging round the zodiac, found thy fate
    In the sign of the Scorpion, which proclaims
    That thou wilt now be crushed.

    _Bel._                        But not by thee.
                         [_They fight;_ BELESES _is wounded and disarmed_.

    _Sar._ (_raising his sword to despatch him, exclaims_)--
    Now call upon thy planets, will they shoot                         280
    From the sky to preserve their seer and credit?

                            [_A party of Rebels enter and rescue_ BELESES.
                              _They assail the King, who in turn, is
                             rescued by a Party of his Soldiers, who drive
                             the Rebels off_.

    The villain was a prophet after all.
    Upon them--ho! there--victory is ours.
                                                       [_Exit in pursuit_.

    _Myr._ (_to Pan._)
    Pursue! Why stand'st thou here, and leavest the ranks
    Of fellow-soldiers conquering without thee?

    _Pan._ The King's command was not to quit thee.

    _Myr._                                         _Me!_
    Think not of me--a single soldier's arm
    Must not be wanting now. I ask no guard,
    I need no guard: what, with a world at stake,
    Keep watch upon a woman? Hence, I say,                             290
    Or thou art shamed! Nay, then, _I_ will go forth,
    A feeble female, 'midst their desperate strife,
    And bid thee guard me _there_--where thou shouldst shield
    Thy sovereign.                                         [_Exit_ MYRRHA.

    _Pan._         Yet stay, damsel!--She's gone.
    If aught of ill betide her, better I
    Had lost my life. Sardanapalus holds her
    Far dearer than his kingdom, yet he fights
    For that too; and can I do less than he,
    Who never flashed a scimitar till now?
    Myrrha, return, and I obey you, though                             300
    In disobedience to the monarch.                         [_Exit_ PANIA.

            _Enter_ ALTADA _and_ SFERO _by an opposite door_.

    _Alt._                       Myrrha!
    What, gone? yet she was here when the fight raged,
    And Pania also. Can aught have befallen them?

    _Sfe._ I saw both safe, when late the rebels fled;
    They probably are but retired to make
    Their way back to the harem.

    _Alt._                      If the King
    Prove victor, as it seems even now he must,
    And miss his own Ionian, we are doomed
    To worse than captive rebels.

    _Sfe._                       Let us trace them:
    She cannot be fled far; and, found, she makes                      310
    A richer prize to our soft sovereign
    Than his recovered kingdom.

    _Alt._                      Baal himself
    Ne'er fought more fiercely to win empire, than
    His silken son to save it: he defies
    All augury of foes or friends; and like
    The close and sultry summer's day, which bodes
    A twilight tempest, bursts forth in such thunder
    As sweeps the air and deluges the earth.
    The man's inscrutable.

    _Sfe._                 Not more than others.
    All are the sons of circumstance: away--                           320
    Let's seek the slave out, or prepare to be
    Tortured for his infatuation, and[y]
    Condemned without a crime.                                  [_Exeunt_.

                  _Enter_ SALEMENES _and Soldiers, etc._

    _Sal._                    The triumph is
    Flattering: they are beaten backward from the palace,
    And we have opened regular access
    To the troops stationed on the other side
    Euphrates, who may still be true; nay, must be,
    When they hear of our victory. But where
    Is the chief victor? where's the King?

             _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS, _cum suis, etc., and_ MYRRHA.

    _Sar._                                  Here, brother.

    _Sal._ Unhurt, I hope.

    _Sar._                 Not quite; but let it pass.                 330
    We've cleared the palace----

    _Sal._                        And I trust the city.
    Our numbers gather; and I've ordered onward
    A cloud of Parthians, hitherto reserved,
    All fresh and fiery, to be poured upon them
    In their retreat, which soon will be a flight.

    _Sar._ It is already, or at least they marched
    Faster than I could follow with my Bactrians,
    Who spared no speed. I am spent: give me a seat.

    _Sal._ There stands the throne, Sire.

    _Sar._                                Tis no place to rest on,
    For mind nor body: let me have a couch,                            340
                                                     [_They place a seat_.
    A peasant's stool, I care not what: so--now
    I breathe more freely.

    _Sal._                 This great hour has proved
    The brightest and most glorious of your life.

    _Sar._ And the most tiresome. Where's my cupbearer?
    Bring me some water.

    _Sal._ (_smiling_) 'Tis the first time he
    Ever had such an order: even I,[z]
    Your most austere of counsellors, would now
    Suggest a purpler beverage.

    _Sar._                    Blood--doubtless.
    But there's enough of that shed; as for wine,
    I have learned to-night the price of the pure element:             350
    Thrice have I drank of it, and thrice renewed,
    With greater strength than the grape ever gave me,
    My charge upon the rebels. Where's the soldier
    Who gave me water in his helmet?[20]

    _One of the Guards_.              Slain, Sire!
    An arrow pierced his brain, while, scattering[aa]
    The last drops from his helm, he stood in act
    To place it on his brows.

    _Sar._                   Slain! unrewarded!
    And slain to serve my thirst: that's hard, poor slave!
    Had he but lived, I would have gorged him with
    Gold: all the gold of earth could ne'er repay                      360
    The pleasure of that draught; for I was parched
    As I am now.                           [_They bring water--he drinks_.
                 I live again--from henceforth
    The goblet I reserve for hours of love,
    But war on water.

    _Sal._            And that bandage, Sire,
    Which girds your arm?

    _Sar._                A scratch from brave Beleses.

    _Myr._ Oh! he is wounded![ab]

    _Sar._                        Not too much of that;
    And yet it feels a little stiff and painful,
    Now I am cooler.

    _Myr._           You have bound it with----

    _Sar._ The fillet of my diadem: the first time
    That ornament was ever aught to me,                                370
    Save an incumbrance.

    _Myr._ (_to the Attendants_). Summon speedily
    A leech of the most skilful: pray, retire:
    I will unbind your wound and tend it.

    _Sar._                                Do so,
    For now it throbs sufficiently: but what
    Know'st thou of wounds? yet wherefore do I ask?
    Know'st thou, my brother, where I lighted on
    This minion?

    _Sal._       Herding with the other females,
    Like frightened antelopes.

    _Sar._                     No: like the dam
    Of the young lion, femininely raging
    (And femininely meaneth furiously,                                 380
    Because all passions in excess are female,)
    Against the hunter flying with her cub,
    She urged on with her voice and gesture, and
    Her floating hair and flashing eyes,[21] the soldiers,
    In the pursuit.

    _Sal._         Indeed!

    _Sar._                You see, this night
    Made warriors of more than me. I paused
    To look upon her, and her kindled cheek;
    Her large black eyes, that flashed through her long hair
    As it streamed o'er her; her blue veins that rose
    Along her most transparent brow; her nostril                       390
    Dilated from its symmetry; her lips
    Apart; her voice that clove through all the din,
    As a lute pierceth through the cymbal's clash,
    Jarred but not drowned by the loud brattling; her
    Waved arms, more dazzling with their own born whiteness
    Than the steel her hand held, which she caught up
    From a dead soldier's grasp;--all these things made
    Her seem unto the troops a prophetess
    Of victory, or Victory herself,
    Come down to hail us hers.[22]

    _Sal._ (_aside_).           This is too much.                      400
    Again the love-fit's on him, and all's lost,
    Unless we turn his thoughts. (_Aloud_.) But pray thee, Sire,
    Think of your wound--you said even now 'twas painful.

    _Sar._ That's true, too; but I must not think of it.

    _Sal._ I have looked to all things needful, and will now
    Receive reports of progress made in such
    Orders as I had given, and then return
    To hear your further pleasure.

    _Sar._                         Be it so.

    _Sal._ (_in retiring_). Myrrha!

    _Myr._                         Prince!

    _Sal._         You have shown a soul to-night,
    Which, were he not my sister's lord----But now                     410
    I have no time: thou lovest the King?

    _Myr._                               I love
    Sardanapalus.

    _Sal._         But wouldst have him King still?

    _Myr._ I would not have him less than what he should be.

    _Sal._ Well then, to have him King, and yours, and all
    He should, or should not be; to have him _live_,
    Let him not sink back into luxury.
    You have more power upon his spirit than
    Wisdom within these walls, or fierce rebellion
    Raging without: look well that he relapse not.

    _Myr._ There needed not the voice of Salemenes                     420
    To urge me on to this: I will not fail.
    All that a woman's weakness can----

    _Sal._                               Is power
    Omnipotent o'er such a heart as his:
    Exert it wisely.                                    [_Exit_ SALEMENES.

    _Sar._           Myrrha! what, at whispers
    With my stern brother? I shall soon be jealous.

    _Myr._ (_smiling_).
    You have cause, Sire; for on the earth there breathes not
    A man more worthy of a woman's love,
    A soldier's trust, a subject's reverence,
    A king's esteem--the whole world's admiration!

    _Sar._ Praise him, but not so warmly. I must not                   430
    Hear those sweet lips grow eloquent in aught
    That throws me into shade; yet you speak truth.

    _Myr._ And now retire, to have your wound looked to,
    Pray lean on me.

    _Sar._          Yes, love! but not from pain.
                                                          [_Exeunt omnes_.




                                 ACT IV.

            SCENE I.--SARDANAPALUS _discovered sleeping upon a
            Couch, and occasionally disturbed in his slumbers,
                         with_ MYRRHA _watching_.

    _Myr._ (_sola, gazing_).
    I have stolen upon his rest, if rest it be,
    Which thus convulses slumber: shall I wake him?
    No, he seems calmer. Oh, thou God of Quiet!
    Whose reign is o'er sealed eyelids and soft dreams,
    Or deep, deep sleep, so as to be unfathomed,
    Look like thy brother, Death,[23]--so still, so stirless--
    For then we are happiest, as it may be, we
    Are happiest of all within the realm
    Of thy stern, silent, and unwakening Twin.
    Again he moves--again the play of pain                              10
    Shoots o'er his features, as the sudden gust
    Crisps the reluctant lake that lay so calm[ac]
    Beneath the mountain shadow; or the blast
    Ruffles the autumn leaves, that drooping cling
    Faintly and motionless to their loved boughs.
    I must awake him--yet not yet; who knows
    From what I rouse him? It seems pain; but if
    I quicken him to heavier pain? The fever
    Of this tumultuous night, the grief too of
    His wound, though slight, may cause all this, and shake            20
    Me more to see than him to suffer. No:
    Let Nature use her own maternal means,
    And I await to second, not disturb her.

    _Sar._ (_awakening_).
    Not so--although he multiplied the stars,
    And gave them to me as a realm to share
    From you and with you! I would not so purchase
    The empire of Eternity. Hence--hence--
    Old Hunter of the earliest brutes! and ye,[ad]
    Who hunted fellow-creatures as if brutes!
    Once bloody mortals--and now bloodier idols,                        30
    If your priests lie not! And thou, ghastly Beldame!
    Dripping with dusky gore, and trampling on
    The carcasses of Inde--away! away!
    Where am I? Where the spectres? Where--No--that
    Is no false phantom: I should know it 'midst
    All that the dead dare gloomily raise up
    From their black gulf to daunt the living. Myrrha!

    _Myr._ Alas! thou art pale, and on thy brow the drops
    Gather like night dew. My beloved, hush--
    Calm thee. Thy speech seems of another world,                       40
    And thou art lord of this. Be of good cheer;
    All will go well.

    _Sar._            Thy _hand_--so--'tis thy hand;
    'Tis flesh; grasp--clasp--yet closer, till I feel
    Myself that which I was.

    _Myr._                   At least know me
    For what I am, and ever must be--thine.

    _Sar._ I know it now. I know this life again.
    Ah, Myrrha! I have been where we shall be.

    _Myr._ My lord!

    _Sar._          I've been i' the grave--where worms are lords
    And kings are----But I did not deem it so;
    I thought 'twas nothing.

    _Myr._                   So it is; except                           50
    Unto the timid, who anticipate
    That which may never be.

    _Sar._                   Oh, Myrrha! if
    Sleep shows such things, what may not Death disclose?

    _Myr._ I know no evil Death can show, which Life
    Has not already shown to those who live
    Embodied longest. If there be indeed
    A shore where Mind survives, 'twill be as Mind
    All unincorporate: or if there flits
    A shadow of this cumbrous clog of clay.
    Which stalks, methinks, between our souls and heaven,               60
    And fetters us to earth--at least the phantom,
    Whate'er it have to fear, will not fear Death.

    _Sar._ I fear it not; but I have felt--have seen--
    A legion of the dead.

    _Myr._                And so have I.
    The dust we tread upon was once alive,
    And wretched. But proceed: what hast thou seen?
    Speak it, 'twill lighten thy dimmed mind.

    _Sar._                                    Methought----

    _Myr._ Yet pause, thou art tired--in pain--exhausted; all
    Which can impair both strength and spirit: seek
    Rather to sleep again.

    _Sar._                 Not now--I would not                         70
    Dream; though I know it now to be a dream
    What I have dreamt:--and canst thou bear to hear it?

    _Myr._ I can bear all things, dreams of life or death,
    Which I participate with you in semblance
    Or full reality.

    _Sar._           And this looked real,
    I tell you: after that these eyes were open,
    I saw them in their flight--for then they fled.

    _Myr._ Say on.

    _Sar._           I saw, that is, I dreamed myself
    Here--here--even where we are, guests as we were,
    Myself a host that deemed himself but guest,                        80
    Willing to equal all in social freedom;
    But, on my right hand and my left, instead
    Of thee and Zames, and our customed meeting,
    Was ranged on my left hand a haughty, dark,
    And deadly face; I could not recognise it,
    Yet I had seen it, though I knew not where:
    The features were a Giant's, and the eye
    Was still, yet lighted; his long locks curled down
    On his vast bust, whence a huge quiver rose
    With shaft-heads feathered from the eagle's wing,                   90
    That peeped up bristling through his serpent hair.[ae]
    I invited him to fill the cup which stood
    Between us, but he answered not; I filled it;
    He took it not, but stared upon me, till
    I trembled at the fixed glare of his eye:
    I frowned upon him as a king should frown;
    He frowned not in his turn, but looked upon me
    With the same aspect, which appalled me more,
    Because it changed not; and I turned for refuge
    To milder guests, and sought them on the right,                    100
    Where thou wert wont to be. But----                      [_He pauses_.

    _Myr._                           What instead?

    _Sar._ In thy own chair--thy own place in the banquet--
    I sought thy sweet face in the circle--but
    Instead--a grey-haired, withered, bloody-eyed,
    And bloody-handed, ghastly, ghostly thing,
    Female in garb, and crowned upon the brow,
    Furrowed with years, yet sneering with the passion
    Of vengeance, leering too with that of lust,
    Sate:--my veins curdled.[24]

    _Myr._                Is this all?

    _Sar._                              Upon
    Her right hand--her lank, bird-like, right hand--stood             110
    A goblet, bubbling o'er with blood; and on
    Her left, another, filled with--what I saw not,
    But turned from it and her. But all along
    The table sate a range of crowned wretches,
    Of various aspects, but of one expression.

    _Myr._ And felt you not this a mere vision?

    _Sar._                                        No:
    It was so palpable, I could have touched them.
    I turned from one face to another, in
    The hope to find at last one which I knew
    Ere I saw theirs: but no--all turned upon me,                      120
    And stared, but neither ate nor drank, but stared,
    Till I grew stone, as they seemed half to be,
    Yet breathing stone, for I felt life in them,
    And life in me: there was a horrid kind
    Of sympathy between us, as if they
    Had lost a part of death to come to me,
    And I the half of life to sit by them.
    We were in an existence all apart
    From heaven or earth----And rather let me see
    Death all than such a being!

    _Myr._                       And the end?                          130

    _Sar._ At last I sate, marble, as they, when rose
    The Hunter and the Crone; and smiling on me--
    Yes, the enlarged but noble aspect of
    The Hunter smiled upon me--I should say,
    His lips, for his eyes moved not--and the woman's
    Thin lips relaxed to something like a smile.
    Both rose, and the crowned figures on each hand
    Rose also, as if aping their chief shades--
    Mere mimics even in death--but I sate still:
    A desperate courage crept through every limb,                      140
    And at the last I feared them not, but laughed
    Full in their phantom faces. But then--then
    The Hunter laid his hand on mine: I took it,
    And grasped it--but it melted from my own;
    While he too vanished, and left nothing but
    The memory of a hero, for he looked so.

    _Myr._ And was: the ancestor of heroes, too,
    And thine no less.

    _Sar._             Aye, Myrrha, but the woman,
    The female who remained, she flew upon me,
    And burnt my lips up with her noisome kisses;                      150
    And, flinging down the goblets on each hand,
    Methought their poisons flowed around us, till
    Each formed a hideous river. Still she clung;
    The other phantoms, like a row of statues,
    Stood dull as in our temples, but she still
    Embraced me, while I shrunk from her, as if,
    In lieu of her remote descendant, I
    Had been the son who slew her for her incest.[25]
    Then--then--a chaos of all loathsome things
    Thronged thick and shapeless: I was dead, yet feeling--            160
    Buried, and raised again--consumed by worms,
    Purged by the flames, and withered in the air!
    I can fix nothing further of my thoughts,
    Save that I longed for thee, and sought for thee,
    In all these agonies,--and woke and found thee.

    _Myr._ So shalt thou find me ever at thy side,
    Here and hereafter, if the last may be.
    But think not of these things--the mere creations
    Of late events, acting upon a frame
    Unused by toil, yet over-wrought by toil--                         170
    Such as might try the sternest.

    _Sar._                          I am better.
    Now that I see thee once more, _what was seen_
    Seems nothing.

                            _Enter_ SALEMENES.

    _Sal._             Is the king so soon awake?

    _Sar._ Yes, brother, and I would I had not slept;
    For all the predecessors of our line
    Rose up, methought, to drag me down to them.
    My father was amongst them, too; but he,
    I know not why, kept from me, leaving me
    Between the hunter-founder of our race,
    And her, the homicide and husband-killer,                          180
    Whom you call glorious.

    _Sal._                  So I term you also,
    Now you have shown a spirit like to hers.
    By day-break I propose that we set forth,
    And charge once more the rebel crew, who still
    Keep gathering head, repulsed, but not quite quelled.

    _Sar._ How wears the night?

    _Sal._                     There yet remain some hours
    Of darkness: use them for your further rest.

    _Sar._ No, not to-night, if 'tis not gone: methought
    I passed hours in that vision.

    _Myr._                         Scarcely one;
    I watched by you: it was a heavy hour,                             190
    But an hour only.

    _Sar._             Let us then hold council;
    To-morrow we set forth.

    _Sal._                 But ere that time,
    I had a grace to seek.

    _Sar._                'Tis granted.

    _Sal._                             Hear it
    Ere you reply too readily; and 'tis
    For _your_ ear only.

    _Myr._              Prince, I take my leave.
                                                             [Exit MYRRHA.

    _Sal._ That slave deserves her freedom.

    _Sar._                                 Freedom only!
    That slave deserves to share a throne.

    _Sal._                                 Your patience--
    'Tis not yet vacant, and 'tis of its partner
    I come to speak with you.

    _Sar._                   How! of the Queen?

    _Sal._ Even so. I judged it fitting for their safety,              200
    That, ere the dawn, she sets forth with her children
    For Paphlagonia, where our kinsman Cotta[26]
    Governs; and there, at all events, secure
    My nephews and your sons their lives, and with them
    Their just pretensions to the crown in case----

    _Sar._ I perish--as is probable: well thought--
    Let them set forth with a sure escort.

    _Sal._                                That
    Is all provided, and the galley ready
    To drop down the Euphrates; but ere they
    Depart, will you not see----

    _Sar._                       My sons? It may                       210
    Unman my heart, and the poor boys will weep;
    And what can I reply to comfort them,
    Save with some hollow hopes, and ill-worn smiles?
    You know I cannot feign.

    _Sal._                  But you can feel!
    At least, I trust so: in a word, the Queen
    Requests to see you ere you part--for ever.

    _Sar._ Unto what end? what purpose? I will grant
    Aught--all that she can ask--but such a meeting.

    _Sal._ You know, or ought to know, enough of women,
    Since you have studied them so steadily[af],                       220
    That what they ask in aught that touches on
    The heart, is dearer to their feelings or
    Their fancy, than the whole external world.
    I think as you do of my sister's wish;
    But 'twas her wish--she is my sister--you
    Her husband--will you grant it?

    _Sar._                         'Twill be useless:
    But let her come.

    _Sal._            I go.                             [_Exit_ SALEMENES.

    _Sar._                 We have lived asunder
    Too long to meet again--and _now_ to meet!
    Have I not cares enow, and pangs enow,
    To bear alone, that we must mingle sorrows,                        230
    Who have ceased to mingle love?

                    _Re-enter_ SALEMENES _and_ ZARINA.

    _Sal._                          My sister! Courage:
    Shame not our blood with trembling, but remember
    From whence we sprung. The Queen is present, Sire.

    _Zar._ I pray thee, brother, leave me.

    _Sal._                                Since you ask it.
                                                        [_Exit_ SALEMENES.

    _Zar._ Alone with him! How many a year has passed[27],
    Though we are still so young, since we have met,
    Which I have worn in widowhood of heart.
    He loved me not: yet he seems little changed--
    Changed to me only--would the change were mutual!
    He speaks not--scarce regards me--not a word,                      240
    Nor look--yet he _was_ soft of voice and aspect,
    Indifferent, not austere. My Lord!

    _Sar._                            Zarina!

    _Zar._ No, _not_ Zarina--do not say Zarina.
    That tone--That word--annihilate long years,
    And things which make them longer.

    _Sar._                             'Tis too late
    To think of these past dreams. Let's not reproach--
    That is, reproach me not--for the _last_ time----

    _Zar._ And _first_, I ne'er reproached you.

    _Sar._                                     'Tis most true;
    And that reproof comes heavier on my heart
    Than----But our hearts are not in our own power.                  250

    _Zar._ Nor hands; but I gave both.

    _Sar._                            Your brother said
    It was your will to see me, ere you went
    From Nineveh with----(_He hesitates_.)

    _Zar._               Our children: it is true.
    I wish to thank you that you have not divided
    My heart from all that's left it now to love--
    Those who are yours and mine, who look like you,
    And look upon me as you looked upon me
    Once----but _they_ have not changed.

    _Sar._                                Nor ever will.
    I fain would have them dutiful.

    _Zar._                         I cherish
    Those infants, not alone from the blind love                       260
    Of a fond mother, but as a fond woman.
    They are now the only tie between us.

    _Sar._                               Deem not
    I have not done you justice: rather make them
    Resemble your own line than their own Sire.
    I trust them with you--to you: fit them for
    A throne, or, if that be denied----You have heard
    Of this night's tumults?

    _Zar._                  I had half forgotten,
    And could have welcomed any grief save yours,
    Which gave me to behold your face again.

    _Sar._ The throne--I say it not in fear--but 'tis                  270
    In peril: they perhaps may never mount it:
    But let them not for this lose sight of it.
    I will dare all things to bequeath it them;
    But if I fail, then they must win it back
    Bravely--and, won, wear it wisely, not as I[ag]
    Have wasted down my royalty.

    _Zar._                      They ne'er
    Shall know from me of aught but what may honour
    Their father's memory.

    _Sar._                 Rather let them hear
    The truth from you than from a trampling world.
    If they be in adversity, they'll learn                             280
    Too soon the scorn of crowds for crownless Princes,
    And find that all their father's sins are theirs.
    My boys!--I could have borne it were I childless.

    _Zar._ Oh! do not say so--do not poison all
    My peace left, by unwishing that thou wert
    A father. If thou conquerest, they shall reign,
    And honour him who saved the realm for them,
    So little cared for as his own; and if----

    _Sar._ 'Tis lost, all Earth will cry out, "thank your father!"
    And they will swell the echo with a curse.                         290

    _Zar._ That they shall never do; but rather honour
    The name of him, who, dying like a king,
    In his last hours did more for his own memory
    Than many monarchs in a length of days,
    Which date the flight of time, but make no annals.

    _Sar._ Our annals draw perchance unto their close;
    But at the least, whate'er the past, their end
    Shall be like their beginning--memorable.

    _Zar._ Yet, be not rash--be careful of your life,
    Live but for those who love.

    _Sar._                       And who are they?                     300
    A slave, who loves from passion--I'll not say
    Ambition--she has seen thrones shake, and loves;
    A few friends who have revelled till we are
    As one, for they are nothing if I fall;
    A brother I have injured--children whom
    I have neglected, and a spouse----

    _Zar._                             Who loves.

    _Sar._ And pardons?

    _Zar._               I have never thought of this,
    And cannot pardon till I have condemned.

    _Sar._ My wife!

    _Zar._          Now blessings on thee for that word!
    I never thought to hear it more--from thee.                        310

    _Sar._ Oh! thou wilt hear it from my subjects. Yes--
    These slaves whom I have nurtured, pampered, fed,
    And swoln with peace, and gorged with plenty, till
    They reign themselves--all monarchs in their mansions--
    Now swarm forth in rebellion, and demand
    His death, who made their lives a jubilee;
    While the few upon whom I have no claim
    Are faithful! This is true, yet monstrous.

    _Zar._                                    'Tis
    Perhaps too natural; for benefits
    Turn poison in bad minds.

    _Sar._                    And good ones make                       320
    Good out of evil. Happier than the bee,
    Which hives not but from wholesome flowers.

    _Zar._                                     Then reap
    The honey, nor inquire whence 'tis derived.
    Be satisfied--you are not all abandoned.

    _Sar._ My life insures me that. How long, bethink you,
    Were not I yet a king, should I be mortal;
    That is, where mortals _are_, not where they must be?

    _Zar._ I know not. But yet live for my--that is,
    Your children's sake!

    _Sar._                My gentle, wronged Zarina!
    I am the very slave of Circumstance                                330
    And Impulse--borne away with every breath!
    Misplaced upon the throne--misplaced in life.
    I know not what I could have been, but feel
    I am not what I should be--let it end.
    But take this with thee: if I was not formed
    To prize a love like thine, a mind like thine,
    Nor dote even on thy beauty--as I've doted
    On lesser charms, for no cause save that such
    Devotion was a duty, and I hated
    All that looked like a chain for me or others                      340
    (This even Rebellion must avouch); yet hear
    These words, perhaps among my last--that none
    E'er valued more thy virtues, though he knew not
    To profit by them--as the miner lights
    Upon a vein of virgin ore, discovering
    That which avails him nothing: he hath found it,
    But 'tis not his--but some superior's, who
    Placed him to dig, but not divide the wealth
    Which sparkles at his feet; nor dare he lift
    Nor poise it, but must grovel on, upturning                        350
    The sullen earth.

    _Zar._            Oh! if thou hast at length
    Discovered that my love is worth esteem,
    I ask no more--but let us hence together,
    And _I_--let me say _we_--shall yet be happy.
    Assyria is not all the earth--we'll find
    A world out of our own--and be more blessed
    Than I have ever been, or thou, with all
    An empire to indulge thee.

                            _Enter_ SALEMENES.

    _Sal._                    I must part ye--
    The moments, which must not be lost, are passing.

    _Zar._ Inhuman brother! wilt thou thus weigh out                   360
    Instants so high and blest?

    _Sal._                      Blest!

    _Zar._                            He hath been
    So gentle with me, that I cannot think
    Of quitting.

    _Sal._      So--this feminine farewell
    Ends as such partings end, in _no_ departure.
    I thought as much, and yielded against all
    My better bodings. But it must not be.

    _Zar._ Not be?

    _Sal._         Remain, and perish----

    _Zar._                               With my husband----

    _Sal._ And children.

    _Zar._                Alas!

    _Sal._                       Hear me, sister, like
    _My_ sister:--all's prepared to make your safety
    Certain, and of the boys too, our last hopes;                      370
    'Tis not a single question of mere feeling,
    Though that were much--but 'tis a point of state:
    The rebels would do more to seize upon
    The offspring of their sovereign, and so crush----

    _Zar._ Ah! do not name it.

    _Sal._                      Well, then, mark me: when
    They are safe beyond the Median's grasp, the rebels
    Have missed their chief aim--the extinction of
    The line of Nimrod. Though the present King
    Fall, his sons live--for victory and vengeance.

    _Zar._ But could not I remain, alone?

    _Sal._                                What! leave                  380
    Your children, with two parents and yet orphans--
    In a strange land--so young, so distant?

    _Zar._                                   No--
    My heart will break.

    _Sal._               Now you know all--decide.

    _Sar._ Zarina, he hath spoken well, and we
    Must yield awhile to this necessity.
    Remaining here, you may lose all; departing,
    You save the better part of what is left,
    To both of us, and to such loyal hearts
    As yet beat in these kingdoms.

    _Sal._                         The time presses.

    _Sar._ Go, then. If e'er we meet again, perhaps                    390
    I may be worthier of you--and, if not,
    Remember that my faults, though not atoned for,
    Are _ended_. Yet, I dread thy nature will
    Grieve more above the blighted name and ashes
    Which once were mightiest in Assyria--than----
    But I grow womanish again, and must not;
    I must learn sternness now. My sins have all
    Been of the softer order----_hide_ thy tears--
    I do not bid thee _not_ to shed them--'twere
    Easier to stop Euphrates at its source                             400
    Than one tear of a true and tender heart--
    But let me not behold them; they unman me
    Here when I had remanned myself. My brother,
    Lead her away.

    _Zar._         Oh, God! I never shall
    Behold him more!

    _Sal._ (_striving to conduct her_).
                    Nay, sister, I _must_ be obeyed.

    _Zar._ I must remain--away! you shall not hold me.
    What, shall he die alone?--_I_ live alone?

    _Sal._ He shall _not die alone_; but lonely you
    Have lived for years.

    _Zar._                That's false! I knew _he_ lived,
    And lived upon his image--let me go!                               410

    _Sal._ (_conducting her off the stage_).
    Nay, then, I must use some fraternal force,
    Which you will pardon.

    _Zar._                 Never. Help me! Oh!
    Sardanapalus, wilt thou thus behold me
    Torn from thee?

    _Sal._          Nay--then all is lost again,
    If that this moment is not gained.

    _Zar._                             My brain turns--
    My eyes fail--where is he?                              [_She faints_.

    _Sar._ (_advancing_).     No--set her down;
    She's dead--and you have slain her.

    _Sal._                             'Tis the mere
    Faintness of o'erwrought passion: in the air
    She will recover. Pray, keep back.--[_Aside_.] I must
    Avail myself of this sole moment to                                420
    Bear her to where her children are embarked,
    I' the royal galley on the river.
                                               [SALEMENES _bears her off_.

    _Sar._ (_solus_).                This, too--
    And this too must I suffer--I, who never
    Inflicted purposely on human hearts
    A voluntary pang! But that is false--
    She loved me, and I loved her.--Fatal passion!
    Why dost thou not expire at _once_ in hearts
    Which thou hast lighted up at once? Zarina![ah]
    I must pay dearly for the desolation
    Now brought upon thee. Had I never loved                           430
    But thee, I should have been an unopposed
    Monarch of honouring nations. To what gulfs
    A single deviation from the track
    Of human duties leads even those who claim
    The homage of mankind as their born due,
    And find it, till they forfeit it themselves!

                             _Enter_ MYRRHA.

    _Sar._ _You_ here! Who called you?

    _Myr._                            No one--but I heard
    Far off a voice of wail and lamentation,
    And thought----

    _Sar._           It forms no portion of your duties
    To enter here till sought for.

    _Myr._                        Though I might,                      440
    Perhaps, recall some softer words of yours
    (Although they _too were chiding_), which reproved me,
    Because I ever dreaded to intrude;
    Resisting my own wish and your injunction
    To heed no time nor presence, but approach you
    Uncalled for:--I retire.

    _Sar._                   Yet stay--being here.
    I pray you pardon me: events have soured me
    Till I wax peevish--heed it not: I shall
    Soon be myself again.

    _Myr._                I wait with patience,
    What I shall see with pleasure.

    _Sar._                          Scarce a moment                    450
    Before your entrance in this hall, Zarina,
    Queen of Assyria, departed hence.

    _Myr._ Ah!

    _Sar._     Wherefore do you start?

    _Myr._                             Did I do so?

    _Sar._ 'Twas well you entered by another portal,
    Else you had met. That pang at least is spared her!

    _Myr._ I know to feel for her.

    _Sar._                        That is too much,
    And beyond nature--'tis nor mutual[ai]
    Nor possible. You cannot pity her,
    Nor she aught but----

    _Myr._               Despise the favourite slave?
    Not more than I have ever scorned myself.                          460

    _Sar._ Scorned! what, to be the envy of your sex,
    And lord it o'er the heart of the World's lord?

    _Myr._ Were you the lord of twice ten thousand worlds--
    As you are like to lose the one you swayed--
    I did abase myself as much in being
    Your paramour, as though you were a peasant--
    Nay, more, if that the peasant were a Greek.

    _Sar._ You talk it well----

    _Myr._                     And truly.

    _Sar._                               In the hour
    Of man's adversity all things grow daring
    Against the falling; but as I am not                               470
    Quite fall'n, nor now disposed to bear reproaches,
    Perhaps because I merit them too often,
    Let us then part while peace is still between us.

    _Myr._ Part!

    _Sar._       Have not all past human beings parted,
    And must not all the present one day part?

    _Myr._ Why?

    _Sar._     For your safety, which I will have looked to,
    With a strong escort to your native land;
    And such gifts, as, if you had not been all
    A Queen, shall make your dowry worth a kingdom.

    _Myr._ I pray you talk not thus.

    _Sar._                          The Queen is gone:                 480
    You need not shame to follow. I would fall
    Alone--I seek no partners but in pleasure.

    _Myr._ And I no pleasure but in parting not.
    You shall not force me from you.

    _Sar._                           Think well of it--
    It soon may be too late.

    _Myr._                   So let it be;
    For then you cannot separate me from you.

    _Sar._ And will not; but I thought you wished it.

    _Myr._                                             I!

    _Sar._ You spoke of your abasement.

    _Myr._                              And I feel it
    Deeply--more deeply than all things but love.

    _Sar._ Then fly from it.

    _Myr._                  'Twill not recall the past--               490
    'Twill not restore my honour, nor my heart.
    No--here I stand or fall. If that you conquer,
    I live to joy in your great triumph: should
    Your lot be different, I'll not weep, but share it.
    You did not doubt me a few hours ago.

    _Sar._ Your courage never--nor your love till now;
    And none could make me doubt it save yourself.
    Those words----

    _Myr._            Were words. I pray you, let the proofs
    Be in the past acts you were pleased to praise
    This very night, and in my further bearing,                        500
    Beside, wherever you are borne by fate.

    _Sar._ I am content: and, trusting in my cause,
    Think we may yet be victors and return
    To peace--the only victory I covet.
    To me war is no glory--conquest no
    Renown. To be forced thus to uphold my right
    Sits heavier on my heart than all the wrongs[aj]
    These men would bow me down with. Never, never
    Can I forget this night, even should I live
    To add it to the memory of others.                                 510
    I thought to have made mine inoffensive rule
    An era of sweet peace 'midst bloody annals,
    A green spot amidst desert centuries,
    On which the Future would turn back and smile,
    And cultivate, or sigh when it could not
    Recall Sardanapalus' golden reign.
    I thought to have made my realm a paradise,
    And every moon an epoch of new pleasures.
    I took the rabble's shouts for love--the breath
    Of friends for truth--the lips of woman for                        520
    My only guerdon--so they are, my Myrrha:             [_He kisses her_.
    Kiss me. Now let them take my realm and life!
    They shall have both, but never _thee!_

    _Myr._                                 No, never!
    Man may despoil his brother man of all
    That's great or glittering--kingdoms fall, hosts yield,
    Friends fail--slaves fly--and all betray--and, more
    Than all, the most indebted--but a heart
    That loves without self-love! 'Tis here--now prove it.

                            _Enter_ SALEMENES.

    _Sal._ I sought you--How! _she_ here again?

    _Sar._                                     Return not
    _Now_ to reproof: methinks your aspect speaks                      530
    Of higher matter than a woman's presence.

    _Sal._ The only woman whom it much imports me
    At such a moment now is safe in absence--
    The Queen's embarked.

    _Sar._                And well? say that much.

    _Sal._                                         Yes.
    Her transient weakness has passed o'er; at least,
    It settled into tearless silence: her
    Pale face and glittering eye, after a glance
    Upon her sleeping children, were still fixed
    Upon the palace towers as the swift galley
    Stole down the hurrying stream beneath the starlight;              540
    But she said nothing.

    _Sar._                Would I felt no more
    Than she has said!

    _Sal._             'Tis now too late to feel.
    Your feelings cannot cancel a sole pang:
    To change them, my advices bring sure tidings
    That the rebellious Medes and Chaldees, marshalled
    By their two leaders, are already up
    In arms again; and, serrying their ranks,
    Prepare to attack: they have apparently
    Been joined by other Satraps.

    _Sar._                        What! more rebels?
    Let us be first, then.

    _Sal._                 That were hardly prudent                    550
    Now, though it was our first intention. If
    By noon to-morrow we are joined by those
    I've sent for by sure messengers, we shall be
    In strength enough to venture an attack,
    Aye, and pursuit too; but, till then, my voice
    Is to await the onset.

    _Sar._                 I detest
    That waiting; though it seems so safe to fight
    Behind high walls, and hurl down foes into
    Deep fosses, or behold them sprawl on spikes
    Strewed to receive them, still I like it not--                     560
    My soul seems lukewarm; but when I set on them,
    Though they were piled on mountains, I would have
    A pluck at them, or perish in hot blood!--
    Let me then charge.

    _Sal._ You talk like a young soldier.

    _Sar._ I am no soldier, but a man: speak not
    Of soldiership, I loathe the word, and those
    Who pride themselves upon it; but direct me
    Where I may pour upon them.

    _Sal._                     You must spare
    To expose your life too hastily; 'tis not
    Like mine or any other subject's breath:                           570
    The whole war turns upon it--with it; this
    Alone creates it, kindles, and may quench it--
    Prolong it--end it.

    _Sar._            Then let us end both!
    'Twere better thus, perhaps, than prolong either;
    I'm sick of one, perchance of both.
                                              [_A trumpet sounds without_.

    _Sal._                             Hark!

    _Sar._                                  Let us
    Reply, not listen.

    _Sal._            And your wound!

    _Sar._                           'Tis bound--
    'Tis healed--I had forgotten it. Away!
    A leech's lancet would have scratched me deeper;[ak]
    The slave that gave it might be well ashamed
    To have struck so weakly.

    _Sal._                   Now, may none this hour                   580
    Strike with a better aim!

    _Sar._                   Aye, if we conquer;
    But if not, they will only leave to me
    A task they might have spared their king. Upon them!
                                                  [_Trumpet sounds again_.

    _Sal._ I am with you.

    _Sar._               Ho, my arms! again, my arms!
                                                                [_Exeunt_.




                                  ACT V.

                 SCENE I.-_The same Hall in the Palace_.

                           MYRRHA _and_ BALEA.

    _Myr._ (_at a window_)[28]
    The day at last has broken. What a night
    Hath ushered it! How beautiful in heaven!
    Though varied with a transitory storm,
    More beautiful in that variety!
    How hideous upon earth! where Peace and Hope,
    And Love and Revel, in an hour were trampled
    By human passions to a human chaos,
    Not yet resolved to separate elements--
    'Tis warring still! And can the sun so rise,
    So bright, so rolling back the clouds into                          10
    Vapours more lovely than the unclouded sky,
    With golden pinnacles, and snowy mountains,
    And billows purpler than the Ocean's, making
    In heaven a glorious mockery of the earth,
    So like we almost deem it permanent;
    So fleeting, we can scarcely call it aught
    Beyond a vision, 'tis so transiently
    Scattered along the eternal vault: and yet
    It dwells upon the soul, and soothes the soul,
    And blends itself into the soul, until                              20
    Sunrise and sunset form the haunted epoch
    Of Sorrow and of Love; which they who mark not,
    Know not the realms where those twin genii[al]
    (Who chasten and who purify our hearts,
    So that we would not change their sweet rebukes
    For all the boisterous joys that ever shook
    The air with clamour) build the palaces
    Where their fond votaries repose and breathe
    Briefly;--but in that brief cool calm inhale
    Enough of heaven to enable them to bear                             30
    The rest of common, heavy, human hours,
    And dream them through in placid sufferance,
    Though seemingly employed like all the rest
    Of toiling breathers in allotted tasks[am]
    Of pain or pleasure, _two_ names for _one_ feeling,
    Which our internal, restless agony
    Would vary in the sound, although the sense
    Escapes our highest efforts to be happy.

    _Bal._ You muse right calmly: and can you so watch
    The sunrise which may be our last?

    _Myr._                             It is                            40
    Therefore that I so watch it, and reproach
    Those eyes, which never may behold it more,
    For having looked upon it oft, too oft,
    Without the reverence and the rapture due
    To that which keeps all earth from being as fragile
    As I am in this form. Come, look upon it,
    The Chaldee's God, which, when I gaze upon,
    I grow almost a convert to your Baal.

    _Bal._ As now he reigns in heaven, so once on earth
    He swayed.

    _Myr._    He sways it now far more, then; never                     50
    Had earthly monarch half the power and glory
    Which centres in a single ray of his.

    _Bal._ Surely he is a God!

    _Myr._                      So we Greeks deem too;
    And yet I sometimes think that gorgeous orb
    Must rather be the abode of Gods than one
    Of the immortal sovereigns. Now he breaks
    Through all the clouds, and fills my eyes with light
    That shuts the world out. I can look no more.

    _Bal._ Hark! heard you not a sound?

    _Myr._                            No, 'twas mere fancy;
    They battle it beyond the wall, and not                             60
    As in late midnight conflict in the very
    Chambers: the palace has become a fortress
    Since that insidious hour; and here, within
    The very centre, girded by vast courts
    And regal halls of pyramid proportions,
    Which must be carried one by one before
    They penetrate to where they then arrived,
    We are as much shut in even from the sound
    Of peril as from glory.

    _Bal._                  But they reached
    Thus far before.

    _Myr._           Yes, by surprise, and were                         70
    Beat back by valour: now at once we have
    Courage and vigilance to guard us.

    _Bal._                              May they
    Prosper!

    _Myr._    That is the prayer of many, and
    The dread of more: it is an anxious hour;
    I strive to keep it from my thoughts. Alas!
    How vainly!

    _Bal._      It is said the King's demeanour
    In the late action scarcely more appalled
    The rebels than astonished his true subjects.

    _Myr._ 'Tis easy to astonish or appal
    The vulgar mass which moulds a horde of slaves;                     80
    But he did bravely.

    _Bal._              Slew he not Beleses?
    I heard the soldiers say he struck him down.

    _Myr._ The wretch was overthrown, but rescued to
    Triumph, perhaps, o'er one who vanquished him
    In fight, as he had spared him in his peril;
    And by that heedless pity risked a crown.

    _Bal._                                    Hark!

    _Myr._ You are right; some steps approach, but slowly.

         _Enter Soldiers, bearing in_ SALEMENES _wounded, with a
          broken javelin in his side: they seat him upon one of
                the couches which furnish the Apartment_.

    _Myr._ Oh, Jove!

    _Bal._            Then all is over.

    _Sal._                              That is false.
    Hew down the slave who says so, if a soldier.

    _Myr._ Spare him--he's none: a mere court butterfly,                90
    That flutter in the pageant of a monarch.

    _Sal._ Let him live on, then.

    _Myr._                       So wilt thou, I trust.

    _Sal._ I fain would live this hour out, and the event,
    But doubt it. Wherefore did ye bear me here?

    _Sol._ By the King's order. When the javelin struck you,
    You fell and fainted: 'twas his strict command
    To bear you to this hall.

    _Sal._                    'Twas not ill done:
    For seeming slain in that cold dizzy trance,
    The sight might shake our soldiers--but--'tis vain,
    I feel it ebbing!

    _Myr._            Let me see the wound;                            100
    I am not quite skilless: in my native land
    'Tis part of our instruction. War being constant,
    We are nerved to look on such things.[an]

    _Sol._                               Best extract
    The javelin.

    _Myr._       Hold! no, no, it cannot be.

    _Sal._ I am sped, then!

    _Myr._                   With the blood that fast must follow
    The extracted weapon, I do fear thy life.

    _Sal._ And I _not_ death. Where was the King when you
    Conveyed me from the spot where I was stricken?

    _Sol._ Upon the same ground, and encouraging
    With voice and gesture the dispirited troops                       110
    Who had seen you fall, and faltered back.

    _Sal._                                    Whom heard ye
    Named next to the command?

    _Sol._                     I did not hear.

    _Sal._ Fly, then, and tell him, 'twas my last request
    That Zames take my post until the junction,
    So hoped for, yet delayed, of Ofratanes,
    Satrap of Susa. Leave me here: our troops
    Are not so numerous as to spare your absence.

    _Sol._ But Prince----

    _Sal._               Hence, I say! Here's a courtier and
    A woman, the best chamber company.
    As you would not permit me to expire                               120
    Upon the field, I'll have no idle soldiers
    About my sick couch. Hence! and do my bidding!
                                                   [_Exeunt the Soldiers_.

    _Myr._ Gallant and glorious Spirit! must the earth
    So soon resign thee?

    _Sal._               Gentle Myrrha, 'tis
    The end I would have chosen, had I saved
    The monarch or the monarchy by this;
    As 'tis, I have not outlived them.

    _Myr._                             You wax paler.

    _Sal._ Your hand; this broken weapon but prolongs
    My pangs, without sustaining life enough
    To make me useful: I would draw it forth                           130
    And my life with it, could I but hear how
    The fight goes.

                   _Enter_ SARDANAPALUS _and Soldiers_.

    _Sar._         My best brother!

    _Sal._                         And the battle
    Is lost?

    _Sar._ (_despondingly_). You see _me here_.

    _Sal._                                    I'd rather see you _thus!_
                      [_He draws out the weapon from the wound, and dies_.

    _Sar._ And _thus_ I will be seen; unless the succour,
    The last frail reed of our beleagured hopes,
    Arrive with Ofratanes.

    _Myr._                 Did you not
    Receive a token from your dying brother,
    Appointing Zames chief?

    _Sar._                  I did.

    _Myr._                        Where's Zames?

    _Sar._ Dead.

    _Myr._       And Altada?

    _Sar._                   Dying.

    _Myr._                          Pania? Sfero?

    _Sar._ Pania yet lives; but Sfero's fled or captive.               140
    I am alone.

    _Myr._      And is all lost?

    _Sar._                      Our walls,
    Though thinly manned, may still hold out against
    Their present force, or aught save treachery:
    But i' the field----

    _Myr._                I thought 'twas the intent
    Of Salemenes not to risk a sally
    Till ye were strengthened by the expected succours.

    _Sar._ _I_ over-ruled him.

    _Myr._                   Well, the _fault's_ a brave one.

    _Sar._ But fatal. Oh, my brother! I would give
    These realms, of which thou wert the ornament,
    The sword and shield, the sole-redeeming honour,                   150
    To call back----But I will not weep for thee;
    Thou shall be mourned for as thou wouldst be mourned.
    It grieves me most that thou couldst quit this life
    Believing that I could survive what thou
    Hast died for--our long royalty of race.
    If I redeem it, I will give thee blood
    Of thousands, tears of millions, for atonement,
    (The tears of all the good are thine already).
    If not, we meet again soon,--if the spirit
    Within us lives beyond:--thou readest mine,                        160
    And dost me justice now. Let me once clasp
    That yet warm hand, and fold that throbless heart
                                                     [_Embraces the body_.
    To this which beats so bitterly. Now, bear
    The body hence.

    _Sol._          Where?

    _Sar._              To my proper chamber.
    Place it beneath my canopy, as though
    The King lay there: when this is done, we will
    Speak further of the rites due to such ashes.
                            [_Exeunt Soldiers with the body of_ SALEMENES.

                              _Enter_ PANIA.

    _Sar._ Well, Pania! have you placed the guards, and issued
    The orders fixed on?

    _Pan._              Sire, I have obeyed.

    _Sar._ And do the soldiers keep their hearts up?

    _Pan._                                            Sire?            170

    _Sar._ I am answered! When a king asks twice, and has
    A question as an answer to _his_ question,
    It is a portent. What! they are disheartened?

    _Pan._ The death of Salemenes, and the shouts
    Of the exulting rebels on his fall,
    Have made them----

    _Sar._           _Rage_--not droop--it should have been.
    We'll find the means to rouse them.

    _Pan._                              Such a loss
    Might sadden even a victory.

    _Sar._                       Alas!
    Who can so feel it as I feel? but yet,
    Though cooped within these walls, they are strong, and we          180
    Have those without will break their way through hosts,
    To make their sovereign's dwelling what it was--
    A palace, not a prison--nor a fortress.

                       _Enter an Officer, hastily_.

    _Sar._ Thy face seems ominous. Speak!

    _Offi._                               I dare not.

    _Sar._                                           Dare not?
    While millions dare revolt with sword in hand!
    That's strange. I pray thee break that loyal silence
    Which loathes to shock its sovereign; we can hear
    Worse than thou hast to tell.

    _Pan._                        Proceed--thou hearest.

    _Offi._ The wall which skirted near the river's brink
    Is thrown down by the sudden inundation                            190
    Of the Euphrates, which now rolling, swoln
    From the enormous mountains where it rises,
    By the late rains of that tempestuous region,
    O'erfloods its banks, and hath destroyed the bulwark.

    _Pan._ That's a black augury! it has been said
    For ages, "That the City ne'er should yield
    To man, until the River grew its foe."

    _Sar._ I can forgive the omen, not the ravage.
    How much is swept down of the wall?

    _Offi._                             About
    Some twenty stadia.[29]

    _Sar._              And all this is left                          200
    Pervious to the assailants?

    _Offi._                     For the present
    The River's fury must impede the assault;
    But when he shrinks into his wonted channel,
    And may be crossed by the accustomed barks,
    The palace is their own.

    _Sar._                   That shall be never.
    Though men, and gods, and elements, and omens,
    Have risen up 'gainst one who ne'er provoked them,
    My father's house shall never be a cave
    For wolves to horde and howl in.

    _Pan._                           With your sanction,
    I will proceed to the spot, and take such measures                 210
    For the assurance of the vacant space
    As time and means permit.

    _Sar._                    About it straight,
    And bring me back, as speedily as full
    And fair investigation may permit,
    Report of the true state of this irruption
    Of waters.                          [_Exeunt_ PANIA _and the Officer_.

    _Myr._    Thus the very waves rise up
    Against you.

    _Sar._      They are not my subjects, girl,
    And may be pardoned, since they can't be punished.

    _Myr._ I joy to see this portent shakes you not.

    _Sar._ I am past the fear of portents: they can tell me            220
    Nothing I have not told myself since midnight:
    Despair anticipates such things.

    _Myr._                           Despair!

    _Sar._ No; not despair precisely. When we know
    All that can come, and how to meet it, our
    Resolves, if firm, may merit a more noble
    Word than this is to give it utterance.
    But what are words to us? we have well nigh done
    With them and all things.

    _Myr._                    Save _one deed_--the last
    And greatest to all mortals; crowning act
    Of all that was, or is, or is to be--                              230
    The only thing common to all mankind,
    So different in their births, tongues, sexes, natures,
    Hues, features, climes, times, feelings, intellects,[ao]
    Without one point of union save in this--
    To which we tend, for which we're born, and thread
    The labyrinth of mystery, called life.

    _Sar._ Our clue being well nigh wound out, let's be cheerful.
    They who have nothing more to fear may well
    Indulge a smile at that which once appalled;
    As children at discovered bugbears.

                            _Re-enter_ PANIA.

    _Pan._                              'Tis                           240
    As was reported: I have ordered there
    A double guard, withdrawing from the wall,
    Where it was strongest, the required addition
    To watch the breach occasioned by the waters.

    _Sar._ You have done your duty faithfully, and as
    My worthy Pania! further ties between us
    Draw near a close--I pray you take this key:
                                                           [_Gives a key_.
    It opens to a secret chamber, placed
    Behind the couch in my own chamber--(Now
    Pressed by a nobler weight than e'er it bore--                     250
    Though a long line of sovereigns have lain down
    Along its golden frame--as bearing for
    A time what late was Salemenes.)--Search
    The secret covert to which this will lead you;
    'Tis full of treasure;[30] take it for yourself
    And your companions:[ap] there's enough to load ye,
    Though ye be many. Let the slaves be freed, too;
    And all the inmates of the palace, of
    Whatever sex, now quit it in an hour.
    Thence launch the regal barks, once formed for pleasure,           260
    And now to serve for safety, and embark.
    The river's broad and swoln, and uncommanded,
    (More potent than a king) by these besiegers.
    Fly! and be happy!

    _Pan._             Under your protection!
    So you accompany your faithful guard.

    _Sar._ No, Pania! that must not be; get thee hence,
    And leave me to my fate.

    _Pan._                   'Tis the first time
    I ever disobeyed: but now----

    _Sar._                      So all men
    Dare beard me now, and Insolence within
    Apes Treason from without. Question no further;                    270
    'Tis my command, my last command. Wilt _thou_
    Oppose it? _thou!_

    _Pan._              But yet--not yet.

    _Sar._                               Well, then,
    Swear that you will obey when I shall give
    The signal.

    _Pan._     With a heavy but true heart,
    I promise.

    _Sar._      'Tis enough. Now order here
    Faggots, pine-nuts, and withered leaves, and such
    Things as catch fire and blaze with one sole spark;
    Bring cedar, too, and precious drugs, and spices,
    And mighty planks, to nourish a tall pile;
    Bring frankincense and myrrh, too, for it is                       280
    For a great sacrifice I build the pyre!
    And heap them round yon throne.

    _Pan._                         My Lord!

    _Sar._                                 I have said it,
    And _you_ have sworn.

    _Pan._               And could keep my faith
    Without a vow.                                          [_Exit_ PANIA.

    _Myr._        What mean you?

    _Sar._                      You shall know
    Anon--what the whole earth shall ne'er forget.

                    PANIA, _returning with a Herald_.

    _Pan._ My King, in going forth upon my duty,
    This herald has been brought before me, craving
    An audience.

    _Sar._      Let him speak.

    _Her._                    The _King_ Arbaces----

    _Sar._ What, crowned already?--But, proceed.

    _Her._                                       Beleses,
    The anointed High-priest----

    _Sar._                      Of what god or demon?                  290
    With new kings rise new altars. But, proceed;
    You are sent to prate your master's will, and not
    Reply to mine.

    _Her._        And Satrap Ofratanes----

    _Sar._ Why, _he_ is _ours_.

    _Her._ (_showing a ring_). Be sure that he is now
    In the camp of the conquerors; behold
    His signet ring.

    _Sar._          'Tis his. A worthy triad!
    Poor Salemenes! thou hast died in time
    To see one treachery the less: this man
    Was thy true friend and my most trusted subject.
    Proceed.

    _Her._   They offer thee thy life, and freedom                     300
    Of choice to single out a residence
    In any of the further provinces,
    Guarded and watched, but not confined in person,
    Where thou shalt pass thy days in peace; but on
    Condition that the three young princes are
    Given up as hostages.

    _Sar._ (_ironically_). The generous Victors!

    _Her._ I wait the answer.

    _Sar._                    Answer, slave! How long
    Have slaves decided on the doom of kings?

    _Her._ Since they were free.

    _Sar._                       Mouthpiece of mutiny!
    Thou at the least shalt learn the penalty                          310
    Of treason, though its proxy only. Pania!
    Let his head be thrown from our walls within
    The rebels' lines, his carcass down the river.
    Away with him!                    [PANIA _and the Guards seizing him_.

    _Pan._        I never yet obeyed
    Your orders with more pleasure than the present.
    Hence with him, soldiers! do not soil this hall
    Of royalty with treasonable gore;
    Put him to rest without.

    _Her._                  A single word:
    My office, King, is sacred.

    _Sar._                     And what's _mine_?
    That thou shouldst come and dare to ask of me                      320
    To lay it down?

    _Her._         I but obeyed my orders,
    At the same peril if refused, as now
    Incurred by my obedience.

    _Sar._                   So there are
    New monarchs of an hour's growth as despotic
    As sovereigns swathed in purple, and enthroned
    From birth to manhood!

    _Her._                My life waits your breath.
    Yours (I speak humbly)--but it may be--yours
    May also be in danger scarce less imminent:
    Would it then suit the last hours of a line
    Such as is that of Nimrod, to destroy                              330
    A peaceful herald, unarmed, in his office;
    And violate not only all that man
    Holds sacred between man and man--but that
    More holy tie which links us with the Gods?

    _Sar._ He's right.--Let him go free.--My life's last act
    Shall not be one of wrath. Here, fellow, take
                              [_Gives him a golden cup from a table near_.
    This golden goblet, let it hold your wine,
    And think of _me_; or melt it into ingots,
    And think of nothing but their weight and value.

    _Her._ I thank you doubly for my life, and this                    340
    Most gorgeous gift, which renders it more precious.
    But must I bear no answer?

    _Sar._                    Yes,--I ask
    An hour's truce to consider.

    _Her._                      But an hour's?

    _Sar._ An hour's: if at the expiration of
    That time your masters hear no further from me,
    They are to deem that I reject their terms,
    And act befittingly.

    _Her._              I shall not fail
    To be a faithful legate of your pleasure.

    _Sar._ And hark! a word more.

    _Her._                        I shall not forget it,
    Whate'er it be.

    _Sar._         Commend me to Beleses;                              350
    And tell him, ere a year expire, I summon
    Him hence to meet me.

    _Her._               Where?

    _Sar._                     At Babylon.
    At least from thence he will depart to meet me.

    _Her._ I shall obey you to the letter.                 [_Exit Herald_.

    _Sar._                                Pania!--
    Now, my good Pania!--quick--with what I ordered.

    _Pan._ My Lord,--the soldiers are already charged.
    And see! they enter.

       _Soldiers enter, and form a Pile about the Throne, etc._[31]

    _Sar._             Higher, my good soldiers,
    And thicker yet; and see that the foundation
    Be such as will not speedily exhaust
    Its own too subtle flame; nor yet be quenched                      360
    With aught officious aid would bring to quell it.
    Let the throne form the _core_ of it; I would not
    Leave that, save fraught with fire unquenchable,
    To the new comers. Frame the whole as if
    'Twere to enkindle the strong tower of our
    Inveterate enemies. Now it bears an aspect!
    How say you, Pania, will this pile suffice
    For a King's obsequies?

    _Pan._                 Aye, for a kingdom's.
    I understand you, now.

    _Sar._                And blame me?

    _Pan._                             No--
    Let me but fire the pile, and share it with you.                   370

    _Myr._ That _duty's_ mine.

    _Pan._                    A woman's!

    _Myr._                              'Tis the soldier's
    Part to die _for_ his sovereign, and why not
    The woman's with her lover?

    _Pan._                     'Tis most strange!

    _Myr._ But not so rare, my Pania, as thou think'st it.
    In the mean time, live thou.--Farewell! the pile
    Is ready.

    _Pan._     I should shame to leave my sovereign
    With but a single female to partake
    His death.

    _Sar._     Too many far have heralded
    Me to the dust already. Get thee hence;
    Enrich thee.

    _Pan._      And live wretched!

    _Sar._                        Think upon                           380
    Thy vow:--'tis sacred and irrevocable.

    _Pan._ Since it is so, farewell.

    _Sar._                            Search well my chamber,
    Feel no remorse at bearing off the gold;
    Remember, what you leave you leave the slaves
    Who slew me: and when you have borne away
    All safe off to your boats, blow one long blast
    Upon the trumpet as you quit the palace.
    The river's brink is too remote, its stream
    Too loud at present to permit the echo
    To reach distinctly from its banks. Then fly,--                    390
    And as you sail, turn back; but still keep on
    Your way along the Euphrates: if you reach
    The land of Paphlagonia, where the Queen
    Is safe with my three sons in Cotta's court,
    Say what you _saw_ at parting, and request
    That she remember what I _said_ at one
    Parting more mournful still.

    _Pan._                      That royal hand!
    Let me then once more press it to my lips;
    And these poor soldiers who throng round you, and
    Would fain die with you!

                             [_The Soldiers and_ PANIA _throng round him,
                               kissing his hand and the hem of his robe_.

    _Sar._                    My best! my last friends!                400
    Let's not unman each other: part at once:
    All farewells should be sudden, when for ever,
    Else they make an eternity of moments,
    And clog the last sad sands of life with tears.
    Hence, and be happy: trust me, I am not
    _Now_ to be pitied; or far more for what
    Is past than present;--for the future, 'tis
    In the hands of the deities, if such
    There be: I shall know soon. Farewell--Farewell.
                                           [_Exeunt_ PANIA _and Soldiers_.

    _Myr._ These men were honest: it is comfort still                  410
    That our last looks should be on loving faces.

    _Sar._ And _lovely_ ones, my beautiful!--but hear me!
    If at this moment,--for we now are on
    The brink,--thou feel'st an inward shrinking from
    This leap through flame into the future, say it:
    I shall not love thee less; nay, perhaps more,
    For yielding to thy nature: and there's time
    Yet for thee to escape hence.

    _Myr._                      Shall I light
    One of the torches which lie heaped beneath
    The ever-burning lamp that burns without,                          420
    Before Baal's shrine, in the adjoining hall?

    _Sar._ Do so. Is that thy answer?

    _Myr._                             Thou shalt see.
                                                           [_Exit_ MYRRHA.

    _Sar._ (_solus_). She's firm. My fathers! whom I will rejoin,
    It may be, purified by death from some
    Of the gross stains of too material being,
    I would not leave your ancient first abode
    To the defilement of usurping bondmen;
    If I have not kept your inheritance
    As ye bequeathed it, this bright part of it,
    Your treasure--your abode--your sacred relics                      430
    Of arms, and records--monuments, and spoils,
    In which _they_ would have revelled, I bear with me
    To you in that absorbing element,
    Which most personifies the soul as leaving
    The least of matter unconsumed before
    Its fiery workings:--and the light of this
    Most royal of funereal pyres shall be[aq]
    Not a mere pillar formed of cloud and flame,
    A beacon in the horizon for a day,
    And then a mount of ashes--but a light[ar]                         440
    To lesson ages, rebel nations, and
    Voluptuous princes. Time shall quench full many
    A people's records, and a hero's acts;
    Sweep empire after empire, like this first
    Of empires, into nothing; but even then
    Shall spare this deed of mine, and hold it up
    A problem few dare imitate, and none
    Despise--but, it may be, avoid the life
    Which led to such a consummation.

            MYRRHA _returns with a lighted Torch in one Hand,
                         and a Cup in the other_.

    _Myr._                           Lo!
    I've lit the lamp which lights us to the stars.                    450

    _Sar._ And the cup?

    _Myr._              'Tis my country's custom to
    Make a libation to the Gods.

    _Sar._                     And mine
    To make libations amongst men. I've not
    Forgot the custom; and although alone,
    Will drain one draught in memory of many
    A joyous banquet past.

                        [SARDANAPALUS _takes the cup, and after drinking
                         and tinkling the reversed cup, as a drop falls,
                         exclaims_--

                           And this libation
    Is for the excellent Beleses.

    _Myr._                       Why
    Dwells thy mind rather upon that man's name
    Than on his mate's in villany?

    _Sar._                        The other
    Is a mere soldier, a mere tool, a kind                             460
    Of human sword in a friend's hand; the other
    Is master-mover of his warlike puppet;
    But I dismiss them from my mind.--Yet pause,
    My Myrrha! dost thou truly follow me,
    Freely and fearlessly?

    _Myr._                And dost thou think
    A Greek girl dare not do for love, that which
    An Indian widow braves for custom?[as]

    _Sar._                                Then
    We but await the signal.

    _Myr._                  It is long
    In sounding.

    _Sar._      Now, farewell; one last embrace.

    _Myr._ Embrace, but _not_ the last; there is one more.             470

    _Sar._ True, the commingling fire will mix our ashes.

    _Myr._ And pure as is my love to thee, shall they,
    Purged from the dross of earth, and earthly passion,
    Mix pale with thine. A single thought yet irks me.

    _Sar._ Say it.

    _Myr._         It is that no kind hand will gather
    The dust of both into one urn.

    _Sar._                     The better:
    Rather let them be borne abroad upon
    The winds of heaven, and scattered into air,
    Than be polluted more by human hands
    Of slaves and traitors. In this blazing palace,                    480
    And its enormous walls of reeking ruin,
    We leave a nobler monument than Egypt
    Hath piled in her brick mountains, o'er dead kings,[32]
    Or _kine_--for none know whether those proud piles
    Be for their monarch, or their ox-god Apis:
    So much for monuments that have forgotten
    Their very record!

    _Myr._            Then farewell, thou earth!
    And loveliest spot of earth! farewell, Ionia!
    Be thou still free and beautiful, and far
    Aloof from desolation! My last prayer                              490
    Was for thee, my last thoughts, save _one_, were of thee!

    _Sar._ And that?

    _Myr._          Is yours.
                                 [_The trumpet of_ PANIA _sounds without_.

    _Sar._                   Hark!

    _Myr._                        _Now_!

    _Sar._                               Adieu, Assyria!
    I loved thee well, my own, my fathers' land,
    And better as my country than my kingdom.
    I sated thee with peace and joys; and this
    Is my reward! and now I owe thee nothing,
    Not even a grave.                               [_He mounts the pile_.
                     Now, Myrrha!

    _Myr._                      Art thou ready?

    _Sar._ As the torch in thy grasp.

besides that he was seen of none out of his family, he led a most
effeminate life: for wallowing in Pleasure and wanton Dalliances, he
cloathed himself in Womens' attire, and spun fine Wool and Purple
amongst the throngs of his Whores and Concubines. He painted likewise
his Face, and decked his whole Body with other Allurements.... He
imitated likewise a Woman's voice...; and proceeded to such a degree of
voluptuousness that he composed verses for his Epitaph ... which were
thus translated by a Grecian out of the Barbarian language--

Booth, of the City of Chester, Esquire, 1700, p. 65.

"Another king of the sort was Sardanapalus.... And so, when Arbaces, who
was one of the generals under him, a Mede by birth, endeavoured to
manage by the assistance of one of the eunuchs, whose name was
Sparamizus, to see Sardanapalus: and when ... he saw him painted with
vermilion, and adorned like a woman, sitting among his concubines,
carding purple wool, and sitting among them with his feet up, wearing a
woman's robe, and with his beard carefully scraped, and his face
smoothed with pumice stone (for he was whiter than milk, and pencilled
under his eyes and eyebrows; and when he saw Arbaces he was putting a
little more white under his eyes). Most historians, of whom Duris is
one, relate that Arbaces, being indignant at his countrymen being ruled
over by such a monarch as that, stabbed him and slew him. But Ctesias
says that he went to war with him, and collected a great army, and then
that Sardanapalus, being dethroned by Arbaces, died, burning himself
alive in his palace, having heaped up a funeral pile four plethra in
extent, on which he placed 150 golden couches."--_The Deipnosophistae_
... of Athenaeus, bk. xii. c. 38, translated by C. D. Yonge, 1854, iii.
847.]

[5] {13}[This prince surpassed all his predecessors in effeminacy,
luxury, and cowardice. He never went out of his palace, but spent all
his time among a company of women, dressed and painted like them, and
employed like them at the distaff. He placed all his happiness and glory
in the possession of immense treasures, in feasting and rioting, and
indulging himself in all the most infamous and criminal pleasures. He
ordered two verses to be put upon his tomb, signifying that he carried
away with him all he had eaten, and all the pleasures he had enjoyed,
but left everything else behind him,--_an epitaph_, says Aristotle, _fit
for a hog_. Arbaces, governor of Media, having found means to get into
the palace, and having with his own eyes seen Sardanapalus in the midst
of his infamous seraglio, enraged at such a spectacle, and not able to
endure that so many brave men should be subjected to a prince more soft
and effeminate than the women themselves, immediately formed a
conspiracy against him. Beleses, governor of Babylon, and several
others, entered into it. On the first rumour of this revolt the king hid
himself in the inmost part of his palace. Being afterwards obliged to
take the field with some forces which he had assembled, he at first
gained three successive victories over the enemy, but was afterwards
overcome, and pursued to the gates of Nineveh; wherein he shut himself,
in hopes the rebels would never be able to take a city so well
fortified, and stored with provisions for a considerable time. The siege
proved indeed of very great length. It had been declared by an ancient
oracle that Nineveh could never be taken unless the river became an
enemy to the city. These words buoyed up Sardanapalus, because he looked
upon the thing as impossible. But when he saw that the Tigris, by a
violent inundation, had thrown down twenty stadia (two miles and a half)
of the city wall, and by that means opened a passage to the enemy, he
understood the meaning of the oracle, and thought himself lost. He
resolved, however, to die in such a manner as, according to his opinion,
should cover the infamy of his scandalous and effeminate life. He
ordered a pile of wood to be made in his palace, and, setting fire to
it, burnt himself, his eunuchs, his women, and his treasures.--Diod.
Sic., _Bibl. Hist_., lib. ii. pag. 78, sqq., ed. 1604, p. 109.]

[6] ["The words _Queen_ (_vide infra_, line 83) and _pavilion_ occur,
but it is not an allusion to his Britannic Majesty, as you may
tremulously (for the admiralty custom) imagine. This you will one day
see (if I finish it), as I have made Sardanapalus _brave_ (though
voluptuous, as history represents him), and also as _amiable_ as my poor
powers could render him. So that it could neither be truth nor satire on
any living monarch."--Letter to Murray, May 25, 1821, _Letters_, 1901,
v. 299.

Byron pretended, or, perhaps, really thought, that such a phrase as the
"Queen's wrongs" would be supposed to contain an allusion to the trial
of Queen Caroline (August-November, 1820), and to the exclusion of her
name from the State prayers, etc. Unquestionably if the play had been
put on the stage at this time, the pit and gallery would have applauded
the sentiment to the echo. There was, too, but one "pavilion" in 1821,
and that was not on the banks of the Euphrates, but at Brighton. _Qui
s'excuse s'accuse_. Byron was not above "paltering" with his readers "in
a double sense."]

included the Achaians and the Boeotians, who, together with those to
whom it was afterwards confined, would make nearly the whole of the

[9] [Strabo (_Rerum Geog_., lib. iii. 1807, p. 235) throws some doubt on
the existence of these columns, which he suggests were islands or
"pillar" rocks. According to Plutarch (Langhorne's Translation, 1838, p.
490), Alexander built great altars on the banks of the Ganges, on which
the native kings were wont to "offer sacrifices in the Grecian manner."
Hence, perhaps, the legend of the columns erected by Dionysus.]

[10] "For this expedition he took only a small chosen body of the
phalanx, but all his light troops. In the first day's march he reached
Anchialus, a town said to have been founded by the king of Assyria,
Sardanapalus. The fortifications, in their magnitude and extent, still
in Arrian's time, bore the character of greatness, which the Assyrians
appear singularly to have affected in works of the kind. A monument
representing Sardanapalus was found there, warranted by an inscription
in Assyrian characters, of course in the old Assyrian language, which
the Greeks, whether well or ill, interpreted thus: 'Sardanapalus, son of
Anacyndaraxes, in one day founded Anchialus and Tarsus. Eat, drink,
play; all other human joys are not worth a fillip.' Supposing this
version nearly exact (for Arrian says it was not quite so), whether the
purpose has not been to invite to civil order a people disposed to
turbulence, rather than to recommend immoderate luxury, may perhaps
reasonably be questioned. What, indeed, could be the object of a king of
Assyria in founding such towns in a country so distant from his capital,
and so divided from it by an immense extent of sandy deserts and lofty
mountains, and, still more, how the inhabitants could be at once in
circumstances to abandon themselves to the intemperate joys which their
prince has been supposed to have recommended, is not obvious. But it may
deserve observation that, in that line of coast, the southern of Lesser
Asia, ruins of cities, evidently of an age after Alexander, yet barely
named in history, at this day astonish the adventurous traveller by
their magnificence and elegance amid the desolation which, under a
singularly barbarian government, has for so many centuries been daily
spreading in the finest countries of the globe. Whether more from soil
and climate, or from opportunities for commerce, extraordinary means
must have been found for communities to flourish there; whence it may
seem that the measures of Sardanapalus were directed by juster views
than have been commonly ascribed to him. But that monarch having been
the last of a dynasty ended by a revolution, obloquy on his memory would
follow of course from the policy of his successors and their partisans.
The inconsistency of traditions concerning Sardanapalus is striking in
Diodorus's account of him."--MITFORD's _Greece_, 1820, ix. 311-313, and
note 1.

[The story of the sepulchral monument with its cynical inscription rests
on the authority of Aristobulus, who served under Alexander, and wrote
his history. The passage is quoted by Strabo (lib. xiv. ed. 1808, p.
958), and as follows by Athenaeus (lib. xii. cap. 40) in the
_Deipnosophistae_: "And Aristobulus says, 'In Anchiale, which was built
by Sardanapalus, did Alexander, when he was on his expedition against
the Persians, pitch his camp. And at no great distance was the monument
of Sardanapalus, on which there is a marble figure putting together the
fingers of its right hand, as if it were giving a fillip. And there was
on it the following inscription in Assyrian characters:--

                 Sardanapalus
        The king, and son of Anacyndaraxes,
        In one day built Anchiale and Tarsus:
    Eat, drink, and love, the rest's not worth e'en this.'

By '_this_' meaning the fillip he was giving with his fingers."

"We may conjecture," says Canon Rawlinson, "that the monument was in
reality a stele containing the king [Sennacherib] in an arched frame,
with the right hand raised above the left, which is the ordinary
attitude, and an inscription commemorating the occasion of its erection"
[the conquest of Cilicia and settlement of Tarsus].--_The Five Great
Monarchies, etc._, 1871, ii. 216.]

Satibarzanes sought every place for water.... After much search he found
one of those poor Caunians had about two quarts of bad water in a mean
bottle, and he took it and carried it to the king. After the king had
drawn it all up, the eunuch asked him, 'If he did not find it a
disagreeable beverage?' Upon which he swore by all the gods, 'That he
had never drunk the most delicious wine, nor the lightest and clearest
water with so much pleasure. I wish only,' continued he, 'that I could
find the man who gave it thee, that I might make him a recompense. In
the mean time I entreat the gods to make him happy and
rich.'"--Plutarch's _Artaxerxes_, Langhorne's translation, 1838, p. 694.

famous waking vision of the "Solitary" in the Second Book of the
_Excursion_ (_Works of Wordsworth_, 1889, p. 439)--

    "The appearance, instantaneously disclosed,
    Was of a mighty city--boldly say
    A wilderness of building, sinking far
    And self-withdrawn into a boundless depth,
    Far sinking into splendour--without end!
    Fabric it seemed of diamond and of gold,
    With alabaster domes, and silver spires,
    And blazing terrace upon terrace, high
    Uplifted."

But the difference, even in form, between the two passages is more
remarkable than the resemblance, and the interpretation, the moral of
Byron's vision is distinct from, if not alien to, Wordsworth's. The
"Solitary" sees all heaven opened; the revealed abode of spirits in
beatitude--a refuge and a redemption from "this low world of care;"
while Myrrha drinks in "enough of heaven," a medicament of "Sorrow and
of Love," for the invigoration of "the common, heavy, human hours" of
mortal existence. For a charge of "imitation," see _Works of Lord

                    INTRODUCTION TO _THE TWO FOSCARI_


The _Two Foscari_ was begun on June 12, and finished, within the month,
on July 9, 1821. Byron was still in the vein of the historic drama,
though less concerned with "ancient chroniclers" and original
"authorities" (_vide ante_, Preface to _Marino Faliero_, vol. iv. p. 332)
than heretofore. "The Venetian play," he tells Murray, July 14, 1821, is
"rigidly historical;" but he seems to have depended for his facts, not
on Sanudo or Navagero, but on Daru's _Histoire de la Republique de
Venise_ (1821, ii. 520-537), and on Sismondi's _Histoire des Republiques
... du Moyen Age_ (1815, x. 36-46). The story of the Two Doges, so far
as it concerns the characters and action of Byron's play, may be briefly
re-told. It will be found to differ in some important particulars from
the extracts from Daru and Sismondi which Byron printed in his "Appendix
to the _Two Foscari_" (_Sardanapalus, etc._, 1821, pp. 305-324), and no
less from a passage in Smedley's _Sketches from Venetian History_ (1832,
ii. 93-105), which was substituted for the French "Pieces
justificatives," in the collected edition of 1832-1835, xiii. 198-202,
and the octavo edition of 1837, etc., pp. 790, 791.

Francesco, son of Nicolo Foscari, was born in 1373. He was nominated a
member of the Council of Ten in 1399, and, after holding various offices
of state, elected Doge in 1423. His dukedom, the longest on record,
lasted till 1457. He was married, in 1395, to Maria, daughter of Andrea
Priuli, and, _en secondes noces_, to Maria, or Marina, daughter of
Bartolommeo Nani. By his two wives he was the father of ten
children--five sons and five daughters. Of the five sons, four died of
the plague, and the fifth, Jacopo, lived to be the cause, if not the
hero, of a tragedy.

The younger of the "Two Foscari" was a man of some cultivation, a
collector and student of Greek manuscripts, well-mannered, and of ready
wit, a child and lover of Venice, but indifferent to her ideals and
regardless of her prejudices and restrictions. He seems to have begun
life in a blaze of popularity, the admired of all admirers. His wedding
with Lucrezia Contarini (January, 1441) was celebrated with a novel and
peculiar splendour. Gorgeous youths, Companions of the Hose (_della
calza_), in jackets of crimson velvet, with slashed sleeves lined with
squirrel fur, preceded and followed the bridegroom's train. A hundred
bridesmaids accompanied the bride. Her dowry exceeded 16,000 ducats, and
her jewels, which included a necklace worn by a Queen of Cyprus, were
"rich and rare." And the maiden herself was a pearl of great price. "She
behaved," writes her brother, "and does behave, so well beyond what
could have been looked for. I believe she is inspired by God!"

Jacopo had everything which fortune could bestow, but he lacked a
capacity for right conduct. Four years after his marriage (February 17,
1445) an accusation was laid before the Ten (Romanin, _Storia_, etc.,
iv. 266) that, contrary to the law embodied in the Ducal _Promissione_,
he had accepted gifts of jewels and money, not only from his
fellow-citizens, but from his country's bitterest enemy, Filippo
Visconti, Duke of Milan. Jacopo fled to Trieste, and in his absence the
Ten, supported by a giunta of ten, on their own authority and
independently of the Doge, sentenced him to perpetual banishment at
Nauplia, in Roumania. One of the three _Capi di' dieci_ was Ermolao (or
_Venetice_ Almoro) Donato, of whom more hereafter. It is to be noted
that this sentence was never carried into effect. At the end of four
months, thanks to the intervention of five members of the Ten, he was
removed from Trieste to Treviso, and, two years later (September 13,
1447), out of consideration to the Doge, who pleaded that the exile of
his only son prevented him from giving his whole heart and soul to the
Republic, permitted to return to Venice. So ends the first chapter of
Jacopo's misadventures. He stands charged with unlawful, if not
criminal, appropriation of gifts and moneys. He had been punished, but
less than he deserved, and, for his father's sake, the sentence of exile
had been altogether remitted.

Three years went by, and once again, January, 1451, a charge was
preferred against Jacopo Foscari, and on this occasion he was arrested
and brought before the Ten. He was accused of being implicated in the
murder of Ermolao Donato, who was assassinated November 5, 1450, on
leaving the Ducal Palace, where he had been attending the Council of the
Pregadi. On the morning after the murder Benedetto Gritti, one of the
"avvogadori di Commun," was at Mestre, some five miles from Venice, and,
happening to accost a servant of Jacopo's who was loading a barge with
wood, asked for the latest news from Venice, and got as answer, "Donato
has been murdered!" The possession of the news some hours before it had
been made public, and the fact that the newsmonger had been haunting
the purlieus of the Ducal Palace on the previous afternoon, enabled the
Ten to convict Jacopo. They alleged (Decree of X., March 26, 1451) that
other evidence ("_testificationes et scripturae_") was in their
possession, and they pointed to the prisoner's obstinate silence on the
rack--a silence unbroken save by "several incantations and magic words
which fell from him," as a confirmation of his guilt. Moreover, it was
"for the advantage of the State from many points of view" that convicted
and condemned he should be. The question of his innocence or guilt
(complicated by the report or tradition that one Nicolo Erizzo confessed
on his death-bed that he had assassinated Donato for reasons of his own)
is still under discussion. Berlan (_I due Foscari_, etc., 1852, p. 36)
sums up against him. It may, however, be urged in favour of Jacopo that
the Ten did not produce or quote the _scripturae et testificationes_
which convinced them of his guilt; that they stopped short of the
death-penalty, and pronounced a sentence inadequate to the crime; and,
lastly, that not many years before they had taken into consideration the
possibility and advisability of poisoning Filippo Visconti, an event
which would, no doubt, have been "to the advantage of the State from
many points of view."

Innocent or guilty, he was sentenced to perpetual banishment to the city
of Candia, on the north coast of the island of Crete; and, guilty or
innocent, Jacopo was not the man to make the best of what remained to
him and submit to fate. Intrigue he must, and, five years later (June,
1456), a report reached Venice that papers had been found in his
possession, some relating to the Duke of Milan, calculated to excite
"nuovi scandali e disordini," and others in cypher, which the Ten
could not read. Over and above these papers there was direct evidence
that Jacopo had written to the _Imperatore dei Turchi_, imploring him to
send his galley and take him away from Candia. Here was a fresh instance
of treachery to the Republic, and, July 21, 1456, Jacopo returned to
Venice under the custody of Lorenzo Loredano.

According to Romanin (_Storia, etc._, iv. 284), he was not put to the
torture, but confessed his guilt spontaneously, pleading, by way of
excuse, that the letter to the Duke of Milan had been allowed to fall
into the hands of spies, with a view to his being recalled to Venice and
obtaining a glimpse of his parents and family, even at a risk of a fresh
trial. On the other hand, the _Dolfin Cronaca_, the work of a kinsman of
the Foscari, which records Jacopo's fruitless appeal to the sorrowful
but inexorable Doge, and other incidents of a personal nature,
testifies, if not to torture on the rack, "to mutilation by thirty
strokes of the lash." Be that as it may, he was once more condemned to
lifelong exile, with the additional penalty that he should be imprisoned
for a year. He sailed for Venice July 31, 1456, and died at Candia,
January 12, 1457. Jacopo's misconduct and consequent misfortune
overshadowed the splendour of his father's reign, and, in very truth
"brought his gray hairs with sorrow to the grave."

After his son's death, the aged Doge, now in his eighty-fifth year,
retired to his own apartments, and refused to preside at Councils of
State. The Ten, who in 1446 had yielded to the Doge's plea that a father
fretting for an exiled son could not discharge his public duties, were
instant that he should abdicate the dukedom on the score of decrepitude.
Accounts differ as to the mode in which he received the sentence of
deposition. It is certain that he was compelled to abdicate on Sunday
morning, October 23, 1457, but was allowed a breathing-space of a few
days to make his arrangements for quitting the Ducal Palace.

On Monday, October 24, the Great Council met to elect his successor, and
sat with closed doors till Sunday, October 30.

On Thursday, October 27, Francesco, heedless of a suggestion that he
should avoid the crowd, descended the Giants' Staircase for the last
time, and, says the _Dolfin Cronaca_, "after crossing the courtyard,
went out by the door leading to the prisons, and entered his boat by the
Ponte di Paglia." "He was dressed," says another chronicle (_August.
Cod._ I, cl. vii.), "in a scarlet mantle, from which the fur lining had
been taken," surmounted by a scarlet hood, an old friend which he had
worn when his ducal honours were new, and which he had entrusted to his
wife's care to be preserved for "red" days and festivals of State. "In
his hand he held his staff, as he walked very slowly. His brother Marco
was by his side, behind him were cousins and grandsons ... and in this
way he went to his own house."

On Sunday, October 30, Pasquale Malipiero was declared Doge, and two
days after, All Saints' Day, at the first hour of the morning, Francesco
Foscari died. If the interval between ten o'clock on Sunday night and
one o'clock on Tuesday morning disproves the legend that the discrowned
Doge ruptured a blood-vessel at the moment when the bell was tolling for
the election of his successor, the truth remains that, old as he was, he
died of a broken heart.

His predecessor, Tomaso Mocenigo, had prophesied on his death-bed that
if the Venetians were to make Foscari Doge they would forfeit their
"gold and silver, their honour and renown." "From your position of
lords," said he, "you will sink to that of vassals and servants to men
of arms." The prophecy was fulfilled. "If we look," writes Mr. H. F.
Brown (_Venice, etc._, 1893, p. 306), "at the sum-total of Foscari's reign
... we find that the Republic had increased her land territory by the
addition of two great provinces, Bergamo and Brescia ... But the price
had been enormous ... her debt rose from 6,000,000 to 13,000,000 ducats.
Venetian funds fell to 18-1/2.... Externally there was much pomp and
splendour.... But underneath this bravery there lurked the official
corruption of the nobles, the suspicion of the Ten, the first signs of
bank failures, the increase in the national debt, the fall in the value
of the funds. Land wars and landed possessions drew the Venetians from
the sea to _terra ferma_.... The beginning of the end had arrived." (See
_Two Doges of Venice_, by Alethea Wiel, 1891; _I due Foscari, Memorie
Storicho Critiche_, di Francesco Berlan, 1852; _Storia Documentata di
Venezia_, di S. Romanin, 1855, vol. iv.; _Die beiden Foscari_, von
Richard Senger, 1878. For reviews, etc., of _The Two Foscari, vide
ante_, "Introduction to _Sardanapalus_," p. 5.)

Both Jeffrey in the _Edinburgh_, and Heber in the _Quarterly Review_,
took exception to the character of Jacopo Foscari, in accordance with
the Horatian maxim, "Incredulus odi." "If," said Jeffrey, "he had been
presented to the audience wearing out his heart in exile, ... we might
have caught some glimpse of the nature of his motives." As it is (in
obedience to the "unities") "we first meet with him led from the
'Question,' and afterwards ... clinging to the dungeon walls of his
native city, and expiring from his dread of leaving them." The situation
lacks conviction.

"If," argued Heber, "there ever existed in nature a case so
extraordinary as that of a man who gravely preferred tortures and a
dungeon at home, to a temporary residence in a beautiful island and a
fine climate; it is what few can be made to believe, and still fewer to
sympathize with."

It was, no doubt, with reference to these criticisms that Byron told
Medwin (_Conversations_, 1824, p. 173) that it was no invention of his
that the "young Foscari should have a sickly affection for his native
city.... I painted the men as I found them, as they were--not as the
critics would have them.... But no painting, however highly coloured,
can give an idea of the intensity of a Venetian's affection for his
native city."

Goethe, on the other hand, was "not careful" to note these
inconsistencies and perplexities. He thought that the dramatic handling
of _The Two Foscari_ was "worthy of great praise," was "admirable!"
(_Conversations with Goethe_, 1874, p. 265).

    _Bar._                                 No--he,
    With more than Roman fortitude, is ever
    First at the board in this unhappy process
    Against his last and only son.[38]

    _Lor._                         True--true--
    His _last_.

    _Bar._   Will nothing move you?

    _Lor._                        _Feels he_, think you?

    _Bar._ He shows it not.

    _Lor._                 I have marked _that_--the wretch!

    _Bar._ But yesterday, I hear, on his return
    To the ducal chambers, as he passed the threshold                   30
    The old man fainted.

    _Lor._             It begins to work, then.

    _Bar._ The work is half your own.

    _Lor._                           And should be _all_ mine--
    My father and my uncle are no more.

    _Bar._ I have read their epitaph, which says they died
    By poison.[39]

    _Lor._      When the Doge declared that he
    Should never deem himself a sovereign till
    The death of Peter Loredano, both
    The brothers sickened shortly:--he _is_ Sovereign.

    _Bar._ A wretched one.

    _Lor._                What should they be who make
    Orphans?

    _Bar._ But _did_ the Doge make you so?

    _Lor._                                Yes.                        40

    _Bar._ What solid proofs?

    _Lor._                   When Princes set themselves
    To work in secret, proofs and process are
    Alike made difficult; but I have such
    Of the first, as shall make the second needless.

    _Bar._ But you will move by law?

    _Lor._                          By all the laws
    Which he would leave us.

    _Bar._                  They are such in this
    Our state as render retribution easier
    Than 'mongst remoter nations. Is it true
    That you have written in your books of commerce,
    (The wealthy practice of our highest nobles)                        50
    "Doge Foscari, my debtor for the deaths
    Of Marco and Pietro Loredano,
    My sire and uncle?"[40]

    _Lor._             It is written thus.

    _Bar._ And will you leave it unerased?

    _Lor._                                  Till balanced.

    _Bar._ And how?

                     [_Two Senators pass over the stage, as in their way
                         to "the Hall of the Council of Ten."_

    _Lor._          You see the number is complete.
    Follow me.                                           [_Exit_ LOREDANO.

    _Bar._ (_solus_). Follow _thee_! I have followed long
    Thy path of desolation, as the wave
    Sweeps after that before it, alike whelming[au]
    The wreck that creaks to the wild winds, and wretch
    Who shrieks within its riven ribs, as gush                          60
    The waters through them; but this son and sire
    Might move the elements to pause, and yet
    Must I on hardily like them--Oh! would
    I could as blindly and remorselessly!--
    Lo, where he comes!--Be still, my heart! they are
    Thy foes, must be thy victims: wilt thou beat
    For those who almost broke thee?

          _Enter Guards, with young_ FOSCARI _as Prisoner, etc._

    _Guard_.                         Let him rest.
    Signor, take time.

    _Jac. Fos._        I thank thee, friend, I'm feeble;
    But thou mayst stand reproved.

    _Guard_.                      I'll stand the hazard.

    _Jac. Fos._ That's kind:--I meet some pity, but no mercy;[av]       70
    This is the first.

    _Guard_.          And might be the last, did they
    Who rule behold us.

    _Bar._ (_advancing to the Guard_). There is one who does:
    Yet fear not; I will neither be thy judge
    Nor thy accuser; though the hour is past,
    Wait their last summons--I am of "the Ten,"[41]
    And waiting for that summons, sanction you
    Even by my presence: when the last call sounds,
    We'll in together.--Look well to the prisoner!

    _Jac. Fos._ What voice is that?--'Tis Barbarigo's! Ah!
    Our House's foe, and one of my few judges.                          80

    _Bar._ To balance such a foe, if such there be,
    Thy father sits amongst thy judges.

    _Jac. Fos._                         True,
    He judges.

    _Bar._      Then deem not the laws too harsh
    Which yield so much indulgence to a sire,
    As to allow his voice in such high matter
    As the state's safety--

    _Jac. Fos._           And his son's. I'm faint;
    Let me approach, I pray you, for a breath
    Of air, yon window which o'erlooks the waters.

    _Enter an Officer, who whispers_ BARBARIGO.

    _Bar._ (to the Guard). Let him approach. I must not speak with him
    Further than thus: I have transgressed my duty                      90
    In this brief parley, and must now redeem it[aw]
    Within the Council Chamber.                         [_Exit_ BARBARIGO.

                       [_Guard conducting_ JACOPO FOSCARI _to the window_.

    _Guard_.                  There, sir, 'tis
    Open.--How feel you?

    _Jac. Fos._         Like a boy--Oh Venice!

    _Guard_. And your limbs?

    _Jac. Fos._            Limbs! how often have they borne me[42]
    Bounding o'er yon blue tide, as I have skimmed
    The gondola along in childish race,
    And, masqued as a young gondolier, amidst
    My gay competitors, noble as I,
    Raced for our pleasure, in the pride of strength;
    While the fair populace of crowding beauties,                      100
    Plebeian as patrician, cheered us on
    With dazzling smiles, and wishes audible,
    And waving kerchiefs, and applauding hands,
    Even to the goal!--How many a time have I
    Cloven with arm still lustier, breast more daring,
    The wave all roughened; with a swimmer's stroke
    Flinging the billows back from my drenched hair,
    And laughing from my lip the audacious brine,
    Which kissed it like a wine-cup, rising o'er
    The waves as they arose, and prouder still                         110
    The loftier they uplifted me; and oft,
    In wantonness of spirit, plunging down
    Into their green and glassy gulfs, and making
    My way to shells and sea-weed, all unseen
    By those above, till they waxed fearful; then
    Returning with my grasp full of such tokens
    As showed that I had searched the deep: exulting,
    With a far-dashing stroke, and, drawing deep
    The long-suspended breath, again I spurned
    The foam which broke around me, and pursued                        120
    My track like a sea-bird.--I was a boy then.

    _Guard_. Be a man now: there never was more need
    Of manhood's strength.

    _Jac. Fos._ (_looking from the lattice_). My beautiful, my own,
    My only Venice--_this is breath_! Thy breeze,
    Thine Adrian sea-breeze, how it fans my face!
    Thy very winds feel native to my veins,
    And cool them into calmness! How unlike
    The hot gales of the horrid Cyclades,
    Which howled about my Candiote dungeon,[43] and
    Made my heart sick.

    _Guard_.           I see the colour comes[ax]                      130
    Back to your cheek: Heaven send you strength to bear
    What more may be imposed!--I dread to think on't.

    _Jac. Fos._ They will not banish me again?--No--no,
    Let them wring on; I am strong yet.

    _Guard_.                           Confess,
    And the rack will be spared you.

    _Jac. Fos._                     I confessed
    Once--twice before: both times they exiled me.

    _Guard_. And the third time will slay you.

    _Jac. Fos._                              Let them do so,
    So I be buried in my birth-place: better
    Be ashes here than aught that lives elsewhere.

    _Guard_. And can you so much love the soil which hates you?        140

    _Jac. Fos._ The soil!--Oh no, it is the seed of the soil
    Which persecutes me: but my native earth
    Will take me as a mother to her arms.
    I ask no more than a Venetian grave,
    A dungeon, what they will, so it be here.

                           _Enter an Officer_.

    _Offi._ Bring in the prisoner!

    _Guard_.                       Signor, you hear the order.

    _Jac. Fos._ Aye, I am used to such a summons; 'tis
    The third time they have tortured me:--then lend me
    Thine arm.                                            [_To the Guard_.

    _Offi._   Take mine, sir; 'tis my duty to
    Be nearest to your person.

    _Jac. Fos._               You!--you are he                         150
    Who yesterday presided o'er my pangs--
    Away!--I'll walk alone.

    _Offi._                As you please, Signor;
    The sentence was not of my signing, but
    I dared not disobey the Council when
    They----

    _Jac. Fos._ Bade thee stretch me on their horrid engine.
    I pray thee touch me not--that is, just now;
    The time will come they will renew that order,
    But keep off from me till 'tis issued. As
    I look upon thy hands my curdling limbs
    Quiver with the anticipated wrenching,                             160
    And the cold drops strain through my brow, as if----
    But onward--I have borne it--I can bear it.--
    How looks my father?

    _Offi._             With his wonted aspect.

    _Jac. Fos._ So does the earth, and sky, the blue of Ocean,
    The brightness of our city, and her domes,
    The mirth of her Piazza--even now
    Its merry hum of nations pierces here,
    Even here, into these chambers of the unknown
    Who govern, and the unknown and the unnumbered
    Judged and destroyed in silence,--all things wear                  170
    The self-same aspect, to my very sire!
    Nothing can sympathise with Foscari,
    Not even a Foscari.--Sir, I attend you.
                                 [_Exeunt_ JACOPO FOSCARI, _Officer, etc._

                   _Enter_ MEMMO _and another Senator_.

    _Mem._ He's gone--we are too late:--think you "the Ten"
    Will sit for any length of time to-day?

    _Sen._ They say the prisoner is most obdurate,
    Persisting in his first avowal; but
    More I know not.

    _Mem._          And that is much; the secrets
    Of yon terrific chamber are as hidden
    From us, the premier nobles of the state,                          180
    As from the people.

    _Sen._             Save the wonted rumours,
    Which--like the tales of spectres, that are rife
    Near ruined buildings--never have been proved,
    Nor wholly disbelieved: men know as little
    Of the state's real acts as of the grave's
    Unfathomed mysteries.

    _Mem._               But with length of time
    We gain a step in knowledge, and I look
    Forward to be one day of the decemvirs.

    _Sen._ Or Doge?

    _Mem._         Why, no; not if I can avoid it.

    _Sen._ 'Tis the first station of the state, and may                190
    Be lawfully desired, and lawfully
    Attained by noble aspirants.

    _Mem._                      To such
    I leave it; though born noble, my ambition
    Is limited: I'd rather be an unit
    Of an united and Imperial "Ten,"
    Than shine a lonely, though a gilded cipher.--
    Whom have we here? the wife of Foscari?

                _Enter_ MARINA, _with a female Attendant_.

    _Mar._ What, no one?--I am wrong, there still are two;
    But they are senators.

    _Mem._                Most noble lady,
    Command us.

    _Mar._      _I command_!--Alas! my life                            200
    Has been one long entreaty, and a vain one.

    _Mem._ I understand thee, but I must not answer.

    _Mar._ (_fiercely_). True--none dare answer here save on the rack,
    Or question save those----

    _Mem._ (_interrupting her_). High-born dame![44] bethink thee
    Where thou now art.

    _Mar._             Where I now am!--It was
    My husband's father's palace.

    _Mem._                       The Duke's palace.

    _Mar._ And his son's prison!--True, I have not forgot it;
    And, if there were no other nearer, bitterer
    Remembrances, would thank the illustrious Memmo
    For pointing out the pleasures of the place.                       210

    _Mem._ Be calm!

    _Mar._ (_looking up towards heaven_). I am; but oh, thou eternal God!
    Canst _thou_ continue so, with such a world?

    _Mem._ Thy husband yet may be absolved.

    _Mar._                                  He is,
    In Heaven. I pray you, Signer Senator,
    Speak not of that; you are a man of office,
    So is the Doge; he has a son at stake
    Now, at this moment, and I have a husband,
    Or had; they are there within, or were at least
    An hour since, face to face, as judge and culprit:
    Will _he_ condemn _him_?

    _Mem._                         I trust not.

    _Mar._                                     But if                  220
    He does not, there are those will sentence both.

    _Mem._ They can.

    _Mar._           And with them power and will are one
    In wickedness;--my husband's lost!

    _Mem._                            Not so;
    Justice is judge in Venice.

    _Mar._                     If it were so,
    There now would be no Venice. But let it
    Live on, so the good die not, till the hour
    Of Nature's summons; but "the Ten's" is quicker,
    And we must wait on't. Ah! a voice of wail!
                                                    [_A faint cry within_.

    _Sen._ Hark!

    _Mem._      'Twas a cry of--

    _Mar._                       No, no; not my husband's--
    Not Foscari's.

    _Mem._      The voice was--

    _Mar._                    _Not his_: no.                           230
    He shriek! No; that should be his father's part,
    Not his--not his--he'll die in silence.
                                            [_A faint groan again within_.

    _Mem._                                  What!
    Again?

    _Mar._ _His_ voice! it seemed so: I will not
    Believe it. Should he shrink, I cannot cease
    To love; but--no--no--no--it must have been
    A fearful pang, which wrung a groan from him.

    _Sen._ And, feeling for thy husband's wrongs, wouldst thou
    Have him bear more than mortal pain in silence?

    _Mar._ We all must bear our tortures. I have not
    Left barren the great house of Foscari,                            240
    Though they sweep both the Doge and son from life;
    I have endured as much in giving life
    To those who will succeed them, as they can
    In leaving it: but mine were joyful pangs:
    And yet they wrung me till I _could_ have shrieked,
    But did not; for my hope was to bring forth
    Heroes, and would not welcome them with tears.

    _Mem._ All's silent now.

    _Mar._                  Perhaps all's over; but
    I will not deem it: he hath nerved himself,
    And now defies them.

                       _Enter an Officer hastily_.

    _Mem._            How now, friend, what seek you?                  250

    _Offi._ A leech. The prisoner has fainted.            [_Exit Officer_.

    _Mem._                                     Lady,
    'Twere better to retire.

    _Sen._ (_offering to assist her_), I pray thee do so.

    _Mar._ Off! _I_ will tend him.

    _Mem._                        You! Remember, lady!
    Ingress is given to none within those chambers
    Except "the Ten," and their familiars.

    _Mar._                                 Well,
    I know that none who enter there return
    As they have entered--many never; but
    They shall not balk my entrance.

    _Mem._                          Alas! this
    Is but to expose yourself to harsh repulse,
    And worse suspense.

    _Mar._             Who shall oppose me?

    _Mem._                                 They                        260
    Whose duty 'tis to do so.

    _Mar._                   'Tis _their_ duty
    To trample on all human feelings, all
    Ties which bind man to man, to emulate
    The fiends who will one day requite them in
    Variety of torturing! Yet I'll pass.

    _Mem._ It is impossible.

    _Mar._                 That shall be tried.[ay]
    Despair defies even despotism: there is
    That in my heart would make its way through hosts
    With levelled spears; and think you a few jailors
    Shall put me from my path? Give me, then, way;                     270
    This is the Doge's palace; I am wife
    Of the Duke's son, the _innocent_ Duke's son,
    And they shall hear this!

    _Mem._                   It will only serve
    More to exasperate his judges.

    _Mar._                        What
    Are _judges_ who give way to anger? they
    Who do so are assassins. Give me way.                  [_Exit_ MARINA.

    _Sen._ Poor lady!

    _Mem._            'Tis mere desperation: she
    Will not be admitted o'er the threshold.

    _Sen._                                  And
    Even if she be so, cannot save her husband.
    But, see, the officer returns.
                 [_The Officer passes over the stage with another person_.

    _Mem._                        I hardly                             280
    Thought that "the Ten" had even this touch of pity,
    Or would permit assistance to this sufferer.

    _Sen._ Pity! Is't pity to recall to feeling
    The wretch too happy to escape to Death
    By the compassionate trance, poor Nature's last
    Resource against the tyranny of pain?

    _Mem._ I marvel they condemn him not at once.

    _Sen._ That's not their policy: they'd have him live,
    Because he fears not death; and banish him,
    Because all earth, except his native land,                         290
    To him is one wide prison, and each breath
    Of foreign air he draws seems a slow poison,
    Consuming but not killing.

    _Mem._                    Circumstance
    Confirms his crimes, but he avows them not.

    _Sen._ None, save the Letter, which, he says, was written
    Addressed to Milan's duke, in the full knowledge
    That it would fall into the Senate's hands,
    And thus he should be re-conveyed to Venice.[45]

    _Mem._ But as a culprit.

    _Sen._                  Yes, but to his country;
    And that was all he sought,--so he avouches.                       300

    _Mem._ The accusation of the bribes was proved.

    _Sen._ Not clearly, and the charge of homicide
    Has been annulled by the death-bed confession
    Of Nicolas Erizzo, who slew the late
    Chief of "the Ten."[46]

    _Mem._            Then why not clear him?

    _Sen._                                    That
    They ought to answer; for it is well known
    That Almoro Donato, as I said,
    Was slain by Erizzo for private vengeance.

    _Mem._ There must be more in this strange process than
    The apparent crimes of the accused disclose--                      310
    But here come two of "the Ten;" let us retire.
                                            [_Exeunt_ MEMMO _and Senator_.

                    _Enter_ LOREDANO _and_ BARBARIGO.

    _Bar._ (_addressing_ LOR.).
    That were too much: believe me, 'twas not meet
    The trial should go further at this moment.

    _Lor._ And so the Council must break up, and Justice
    Pause in her full career, because a woman
    Breaks in on our deliberations?

    _Bar._                         No,
    That's not the cause; you saw the prisoner's state.

    _Lor._ And had he not recovered?

    _Bar._                           To relapse
    Upon the least renewal.

    _Lor._                 'Twas not tried.

    _Bar._ 'Tis vain to murmur; the majority                           320
    In council were against you.

    _Lor._                      Thanks to _you_, sir,
    And the old ducal dotard, who combined
    The worthy voices which o'er-ruled my own.

    _Bar._ I am a judge; but must confess that part
    Of our stern duty, which prescribes the Question,[47]
    And bids us sit and see its sharp infliction,
    Makes me wish--

    _Lor._          What?

    _Bar._               That _you_ would _sometimes_ feel,
    As I do always.

    _Lor._        Go to, you're a child,
    Infirm of feeling as of purpose, blown
    About by every breath, shook[48] by a sigh,                        330
    And melted by a tear--a precious judge
    For Venice! and a worthy statesman to
    Be partner in my policy.

    _Bar._                  He shed
    No tears.

    _Lor._   He cried out twice.

    _Bar._                      A Saint had done so,
    Even with the crown of Glory in his eye,
    At such inhuman artifice of pain
    As was forced on him; but he did not cry[az]
    For pity; not a word nor groan escaped him,
    And those two shrieks were not in supplication,
    But wrung from pangs, and followed by no prayers.                  340

    _Lor._ He muttered many times between his teeth,
    But inarticulately.[49]

    _Bar._              That I heard not:
    You stood more near him.

    _Lor._                   I did so.

    _Bar._                            Methought,
    To my surprise too, you were touched with mercy,
    And were the first to call out for assistance
    When he was failing.

    _Lor._              I believed that swoon
    His last.

    _Bar._    And have I not oft heard thee name
    His and his father's death your nearest wish?

    _Lor._ If he dies innocent, that is to say,
    With his guilt unavowed, he'll be lamented.                        350

    _Bar._ What, wouldst thou slay his memory?

    _Lor._                                    Wouldst thou have
    His state descend to his children, as it must,
    If he die unattainted?

    _Bar._                War with _them_ too?

    _Lor._ With all their house, till theirs or mine are nothing.

    _Bar._ And the deep agony of his pale wife,
    And the repressed convulsion of the high
    And princely brow of his old father, which
    Broke forth in a slight shuddering, though rarely,
    Or in some clammy drops, soon wiped away
    In stern serenity; these moved you not?                            360
                                                         [_Exit_ LOREDANO.
    He's silent in his hate, as Foscari
    Was in his suffering; and the poor wretch moved me
    More by his silence than a thousand outcries
    Could have effected. 'Twas a dreadful sight
    When his distracted wife broke through into
    The hall of our tribunal, and beheld
    What we could scarcely look upon, long used
    To such sights. I must think no more of this,
    Lest I forget in this compassion for
    Our foes, their former injuries, and lose                          370
    The hold of vengeance Loredano plans
    For him and me; but mine would be content
    With lesser retribution than he thirsts for,
    And I would mitigate his deeper hatred
    To milder thoughts; but, for the present, Foscari
    Has a short hourly respite, granted at
    The instance of the elders of the Council,
    Moved doubtless by his wife's appearance in
    The hall, and his own sufferings.--Lo! they come:
    How feeble and forlorn! I cannot bear                              380
    To look on them again in this extremity:
    I'll hence, and try to soften Loredano.[ba]
                                                        [_Exit_ BARBARIGO.




                                 ACT II.

                SCENE I.--_A hall in the_ DOGE'S _Palace_.

                       _The_ DOGE _and a Senator_.

    _Sen._ Is it your pleasure to sign the report
    Now, or postpone it till to-morrow?

    _Doge_.                            Now;
    I overlooked it yesterday: it wants
    Merely the signature. Give me the pen--
                              [_The_ DOGE _sits down and signs the paper_.
    There, Signor.

    _Sen._ (_looking at the paper_). You have forgot; it is not signed.

    _Doge_. Not signed? Ah, I perceive my eyes begin
    To wax more weak with age. I did not see
    That I had dipped the pen without effect.[bb]

    _Sen._ (_dipping the pen into the ink, and placing the paper
    before the_ DOGE). Your hand, too, shakes, my Lord: allow me, thus--

    _Doge_. 'Tis done, I thank you.

    _Sen._                          Thus the act confirmed              10
    By you and by "the Ten" gives peace to Venice.

    _Doge_. 'Tis long since she enjoyed it: may it be
    As long ere she resume her arms!

    _Sen._                          'Tis almost
    Thirty-four years of nearly ceaseless warfare
    With the Turk, or the powers of Italy;
    The state had need of some repose.

    _Doge_.                            No doubt:
    I found her Queen of Ocean, and I leave her
    Lady of Lombardy; it is a comfort[bc]
    That I have added to her diadem
    The gems of Brescia and Ravenna; Crema[50]                          20
    And Bergamo no less are hers; her realm
    By land has grown by thus much in my reign,
    While her sea-sway has not shrunk.

    _Sen._                           'Tis most true,
    And merits all our country's gratitude.

    _Doge_. Perhaps so.

    _Sen._              Which should be made manifest.

    _Doge_. I have not complained, sir.

    _Sen._                              My good Lord, forgive me.

    _Doge_. For what?

    _Sen._            My heart bleeds for you.

    _Doge_.                                  For me, Signor?

    _Sen._ And for your----

    _Doge_.                 Stop!

    _Sen._                       It must have way, my Lord:
    I have too many duties towards you
    And all your house, for past and present kindness,                  30
    Not to feel deeply for your son.

    _Doge_.                         Was this
    In your commission?

    _Sen._             What, my Lord?

    _Doge_.                          This prattle
    Of things you know not: but the treaty's signed;
    Return with it to them who sent you.

    _Sen._                              I
    Obey. I had in charge, too, from the Council,
    That you would fix an hour for their reunion.

    _Doge_. Say, when they will--now, even at this moment,
    If it so please them: I am the State's servant.

    _Sen._ They would accord some time for your repose.

    _Doge_. I have no repose, that is, none which shall cause           40
    The loss of an hour's time unto the State.
    Let them meet when they will, I shall be found
    _Where_ I should be, and _what_ I have been ever.
                           [_Exit Senator. The_ DOGE _remains in silence_.

                          _Enter an Attendant_.

    _Att._ Prince!

    _Doge_.       Say on.

    _Att._               The illustrious lady Foscari
    Requests an audience.

    _Doge_.              Bid her enter. Poor
    Marina!
               [_Exit Attendant. The_ DOGE _remains in silence as before_.

                             _Enter MARINA_.

    _Mar._      I have ventured, father, on
    Your privacy.

    _Doge_.      I have none from you, my child.
    Command my time, when not commanded by
    The State.

    _Mar._    I wished to speak to you of _him_.

    _Doge_. Your husband?                                               50

    _Mar._               And your son.

    _Doge_.                           Proceed, my daughter!

    _Mar._ I had obtained permission from "the Ten"
    To attend my husband for a limited number
    Of hours.

    _Doge_.   You had so.

    _Mar._                'Tis revoked.

    _Doge_.                             By whom?

    _Mar._ "The Ten."--When we had reached "the Bridge of Sighs,"[51]
    Which I prepared to pass with Foscari,
    The gloomy guardian of that passage first
    Demurred: a messenger was sent back to
    "The Ten;"--but as the Court no longer sate,
    And no permission had been given in writing,
    I was thrust back, with the assurance that                          60
    Until that high tribunal reassembled
    The dungeon walls must still divide us.

    _Doge_.                                True,
    The form has been omitted in the haste
    With which the court adjourned; and till it meets,
    'Tis dubious.

    _Mar._       Till it meets! and when it meets,
    They'll torture him again; and he and I
    Must purchase by renewal of the rack
    The interview of husband and of wife,
    The holiest tie beneath the Heavens!--Oh God!
    Dost thou see this?

    _Doge_.            Child--child----

    _Mar._ (_abruptly_).        Call _me_ not "child!"                  70
    You soon will have no children--you deserve none--
    You, who can talk thus calmly of a son
    In circumstances which would call forth tears
    Of blood from Spartans! Though these did not weep
    Their boys who died in battle, is it written
    That they beheld them perish piecemeal, nor
    Stretched forth a hand to save them?

    _Doge_.                             You behold me:
    I cannot weep--I would I could; but if
    Each white hair on this head were a young life,
    This ducal cap the Diadem of earth,                                 80
    This ducal ring with which I wed the waves
    A talisman to still them--I'd give all
    For him.

    _Mar._  With less he surely might be saved.

    _Doge_. That answer only shows you know not Venice.
    Alas! how should you? she knows not herself,
    In all her mystery. Hear me--they who aim
    At Foscari, aim no less at his father;
    The sire's destruction would not save the son;
    They work by different means to the same end,
    And that is--but they have not conquered yet.                       90

    _Mar._ But they have crushed.

    _Doge_.                        Nor crushed as yet--I live.

    _Mar._ And your son,--how long will he live?

    _Doge_.                                       I trust,
    For all that yet is past, as many years
    And happier than his father. The rash boy,
    With womanish impatience to return,
    Hath ruined all by that detected letter:
    A high crime, which I neither can deny
    Nor palliate, as parent or as Duke:
    Had he but borne a little, little longer
    His Candiote exile, I had hopes--he has quenched them--            100
    He must return.

    _Mar._         To exile?

    _Doge_.                 I have said it.

    _Mar._ And can I not go with him?

    _Doge_.                            You well know
    This prayer of yours was twice denied before
    By the assembled "Ten," and hardly now
    Will be accorded to a third request,
    Since aggravated errors on the part
    Of your Lord renders them still more austere.

    _Mar._ Austere? Atrocious! The old human fiends,
    With one foot in the grave, with dim eyes, strange
    To tears save drops of dotage, with long white[bd]                 110
    And scanty hairs, and shaking hands, and heads
    As palsied as their hearts are hard, they counsel,
    Cabal, and put men's lives out, as if Life
    Were no more than the feelings long extinguished
    In their accursed bosoms.

    _Doge_.                  You know not----

    _Mar._ I do--I do--and so should you, methinks--
    That these are demons: could it be else that
    Men, who have been of women born and suckled--
    Who have loved, or talked at least of Love--have given
    Their hands in sacred vows--have danced their babes                120
    Upon their knees, perhaps have mourned above them--
    In pain, in peril, or in death--who are,
    Or were, at least in seeming, human, could
    Do as they have done by yours, and you yourself--
    _You_, who abet them?

    _Doge_.              I forgive this, for
    You know not what you say.

    _Mar._                    _You_ know it well,
    And feel it nothing.

    _Doge_.             I have borne so much,
    That words have ceased to shake me.

    _Mar._                             Oh, no doubt!
    You have seen your son's blood flow, and your flesh shook not;
    And after that, what are a woman's words?                          130
    No more than woman's tears, that they should shake you.

    _Doge_. Woman, this clamorous grief of thine, I tell thee,
    Is no more in the balance weighed with that
    Which----but I pity thee, my poor Marina!

    _Mar._ Pity my husband, or I cast it from me;
    Pity thy son! _Thou_ pity!--'tis a word
    Strange to thy heart--how came it on thy lips?

    _Doge_. I must bear these reproaches, though they wrong me.
    Couldst thou but read----

    _Mar._                   'Tis not upon thy brow,
    Nor in thine eyes, nor in thine acts,--where then                  140
    Should I behold this sympathy? or shall?

    _Doge_ (_pointing downwards_). There.

    _Mar._                               In the earth?

    _Doge_.                                 To which I am tending: when
    It lies upon this heart, far lightlier, though
    Loaded with marble, than the thoughts which press it
    Now, you will know me better.

    _Mar._                       Are you, then,
    Indeed, thus to be pitied?

    _Doge_.                   Pitied! None
    Shall ever use that base word, with which men
    Cloak their soul's hoarded triumph, as a fit one
    To mingle with my name; that name shall be,
    As far as _I_ have borne it, what it was                           150
    When I received it.

    _Mar._             But for the poor children
    Of him thou canst not, or thou wilt not save,
    You were the last to bear it.

    _Doge_.                      Would it were so!
    Better for him he never had been born;
    Better for me.--I have seen our house dishonoured.

    _Mar._ That's false! A truer, nobler, trustier heart,
    More loving, or more loyal, never beat
    Within a human breast. I would not change
    My exiled, persecuted, mangled husband,
    Oppressed but not disgraced, crushed, overwhelmed,                 160
    Alive, or dead, for Prince or Paladin
    In story or in fable, with a world
    To back his suit. Dishonoured!--_he_ dishonoured!
    I tell thee, Doge, 'tis Venice is dishonoured;
    His name shall be her foulest, worst reproach,
    For what he suffers, not for what he did.
    'Tis ye who are all traitors, Tyrant!--ye!
    Did you but love your Country like this victim
    Who totters back in chains to tortures, and
    Submits to all things rather than to exile,                        170
    You'd fling yourselves before him, and implore
    His grace for your enormous guilt.

    _Doge_.                            He was
    Indeed all you have said. I better bore
    The deaths of the two sons[52] Heaven took from me,
    Than Jacopo's disgrace.

    _Mar._                 That word again?

    _Doge_. Has he not been condemned?

    _Mar._                            Is none but guilt so?

    _Doge_. Time may restore his memory--I would hope so.
    He was my pride, my----but 'tis useless now--
    I am not given to tears, but wept for joy
    When he was born: those drops were ominous.                        180

    _Mar._ I say he's innocent! And were he not so,
    Is our own blood and kin to shrink from us
    In fatal moments?

    _Doge_.          I shrank not from him:
    But I have other duties than a father's;
    The state would not dispense me from those duties;
    Twice I demanded it, but was refused:[53]
    They must then be fulfilled.

                          _Enter an Attendant_.

    _Att._                     A message from
    "The Ten."

    _Doge_.   Who bears it?

    _Att._                 Noble Loredano.

    _Doge_. He!--but admit him.                         [_Exit Attendant_.

    _Mar._                      Must I then retire?

    _Doge_. Perhaps it is not requisite, if this                       190
    Concerns your husband, and if not----Well, Signor,
                                                [_To_ LOREDANO _entering_.
    Your pleasure?

    _Lor._        I bear that of "the Ten."

    _Doge_.                                They
    Have chosen well their envoy.

    _Lor._                       'Tis _their_ choice
    Which leads me here.

    _Doge_.            It does their wisdom honour,
    And no less to their courtesy.--Proceed.

    _Lor._ We have decided.

    _Doge_.                  We?

    _Lor._                       "The Ten" in council.

    _Doge_. What! have they met again, and met without
    Apprising me?

    _Lor._       They wished to spare your feelings,
    No less than age.

    _Doge_.           That's new--when spared they either?
    I thank them, notwithstanding.

    _Lor._                       You know well                         200
    That they have power to act at their discretion,
    With or without the presence of the Doge.

    _Doge_. 'Tis some years since I learned this, long before
    I became Doge, or dreamed of such advancement.
    You need not school me, Signor; I sate in
    That Council when you were a young patrician.

    _Lor._ True, in my father's time; I have heard him and
    The Admiral, his brother, say as much.
    Your Highness may remember them; they both
    Died suddenly.[54]

    _Doge_.       And if they did so, better                           210
    So die than live on lingeringly in pain.

    _Lor._ No doubt: yet most men like to live their days out.

    _Doge_. And did not they?

    _Lor._                   The Grave knows best: they died,
    As I said, suddenly.

    _Doge_.             Is that so strange,
    That you repeat the word emphatically?

    _Lor._ So far from strange, that never was there death
    In my mind half so natural as theirs.
    Think _you_ not so?

    _Doge_.              What should I think of mortals?

    _Lor._ That they have mortal foes.

    _Doge_.                           I understand you;
    Your sires were mine, and you are heir in all things.              220

    _Lor._ You best know if I should be so.

    _Doge_.                                  I do.
    Your fathers were my foes, and I have heard
    Foul rumours were abroad; I have also read
    Their epitaph, attributing their deaths
    To poison. 'Tis perhaps as true as most
    Inscriptions upon tombs, and yet no less
    A fable.

    _Lor._   Who dares say so?

    _Doge_.                   I!----'Tis true
    Your fathers were mine enemies, as bitter
    As their son e'er can be, and I no less
    Was theirs; but I was _openly_ their foe:                          230
    I never worked by plot in Council, nor
    Cabal in commonwealth, nor secret means
    Of practice against life by steel or drug.
    The proof is--your existence.

    _Lor._                       I fear not.

    _Doge_. You have no cause, being what I am; but were I
    That you would have me thought, you long ere now
    Were past the sense of fear. Hate on; I care not.

    _Lor._ I never yet knew that a noble's life
    In Venice had to dread a Doge's frown,
    That is, by open means.

    _Doge_.                But I, good Signor,                         240
    Am, or at least _was_, more than a mere duke,
    In blood, in mind, in means; and that they know
    Who dreaded to elect me, and have since
    Striven all they dare to weigh me down: be sure,
    Before or since that period, had I held you
    At so much price as to require your absence,
    A word of mine had set such spirits to work
    As would have made you nothing. But in all things
    I have observed the strictest reverence;
    Not for the laws alone, for those _you_ have strained              250
    (I do not speak of _you_ but as a single
    Voice of the many) somewhat beyond what
    I could enforce for my authority,
    Were I disposed to brawl; but, as I said,
    I have observed with veneration, like
    A priest's for the High Altar, even unto
    The sacrifice of my own blood and quiet,
    Safety, and all save honour, the decrees,
    The health, the pride, and welfare of the State.
    And now, sir, to your business.

    _Lor._                        'Tis decreed,                        260
    That, without further repetition of
    The Question, or continuance of the trial,
    Which only tends to show how stubborn guilt is,
    ("The Ten," dispensing with the stricter law
    Which still prescribes the Question till a full
    Confession, and the prisoner partly having
    Avowed his crime in not denying that
    The letter to the Duke of Milan's his),
    James Foscari return to banishment,
    And sail in the same galley which conveyed him.                    270

    _Mar._ Thank God! At least they will not drag him more
    Before that horrible tribunal. Would he
    But think so, to my mind the happiest doom,
    Not he alone, but all who dwell here, could
    Desire, were to escape from such a land.

    _Doge_. That is not a Venetian thought, my daughter.

    _Mar._ No, 'twas too human. May I share his exile?

    _Lor._ Of this "the Ten" said nothing.

    _Mar._                                 So I thought!
    That were too human, also. But it was not
    Inhibited?

    _Lor._    It was not named.

    _Mar. (to the Doge_).      Then, father,                           280
    Surely you can obtain or grant me thus much:
                                                           [_To_ LOREDANO.
    And you, sir, not oppose my prayer to be
    Permitted to accompany my husband.

    _Doge_. I will endeavour.

    _Mar._                   And you, Signor?

    _Lor._                                   Lady!
    'Tis not for me to anticipate the pleasure
    Of the tribunal.

    _Mar._          Pleasure! what a word
    To use for the decrees of----

    _Doge_.                   Daughter, know you
    In what a presence you pronounce these things?

    _Mar._ A Prince's and his subject's.

    _Lor._                               Subject!

    _Mar._                                       Oh!
    It galls you:--well, you are his equal, as                         290
    You think; but that you are not, nor would be,
    Were he a peasant:--well, then, you're a Prince,
    A princely noble; and what then am I?

    _Lor._ The offspring of a noble house.

    _Mar._                                And wedded
    To one as noble. What, or whose, then, is
    The presence that should silence my free thoughts?

    _Lor._ The presence of your husband's Judges.

    _Doge_.                                       And
    The deference due even to the lightest word
    That falls from those who rule in Venice.

    _Mar._                                    Keep
    Those maxims for your mass of scared mechanics,                    300
    Your merchants, your Dalmatian and Greek slaves,
    Your tributaries, your dumb citizens,
    And masked nobility, your sbirri, and
    Your spies, your galley and your other slaves,
    To whom your midnight carryings off and drownings,
    Your dungeons next the palace roofs, or under
    The water's level;[55] your mysterious meetings,
    And unknown dooms, and sudden executions,
    Your "Bridge of Sighs," your strangling chamber, and
    Your torturing instruments, have made ye seem                      310
    The beings of another and worse world!
    Keep such for them: I fear ye not. I know ye;[be]
    Have known and proved your worst, in the infernal
    Process of my poor husband! Treat me as
    Ye treated him:--you did so, in so dealing
    With him. Then what have I to fear _from_ you,
    Even if I were of fearful nature, which
    I trust I am not?

    _Doge_.          You hear, she speaks wildly.

    _Mar._ Not wisely, yet not wildly.

    _Lor._                             Lady! words
    Uttered within these walls I bear no further                       320
    Than to the threshold, saving such as pass
    Between the Duke and me on the State's service.
    Doge! have you aught in answer?

    _Doge_.                        Something from
    The Doge; it may be also from a parent.

    _Lor._ My mission _here_ is to the _Doge_.

    _Doge_.                                   Then say
    The Doge will choose his own ambassador,
    Or state in person what is meet; and for
    The father----

    _Lor._        I remember _mine_.--Farewell!
    I kiss the hands of the illustrious Lady,
    And bow me to the Duke.                              [_Exit_ LOREDANO.

    _Mar._                 Are you content?                           330

    _Doge_. I am what you behold.

    _Mar._                       And that's a mystery.

    _Doge_. All things are so to mortals; who can read them
    Save he who made? or, if they can, the few
    And gifted spirits, who have studied long
    That loathsome volume--man, and pored upon
    Those black and bloody leaves, his heart and brain,[bf]
    But learn a magic which recoils upon
    The adept who pursues it: all the sins
    We find in others, Nature made our own;
    All our advantages are those of Fortune;                           340
    Birth, wealth, health, beauty, are her accidents,
    And when we cry out against Fate, 'twere well
    We should remember Fortune can take nought
    Save what she _gave_--the rest was nakedness,
    And lusts, and appetites, and vanities,
    The universal heritage, to battle
    With as we may, and least in humblest stations,[bg]
    Where Hunger swallows all in one low want,[bh]
    And the original ordinance, that man
    Must sweat for his poor pittance, keeps all passions               350
    Aloof, save fear of famine! All is low,
    And false, and hollow--clay from first to last,
    The Prince's urn no less than potter's vessel.
    Our Fame is in men's breath, our lives upon
    Less than their breath; our durance upon days[bi]
    Our days on seasons; our whole being on
    Something which is not _us_![56]--So, we are slaves,
    The greatest as the meanest--nothing rests
    Upon our will; the will itself no less[bj]
    Depends upon a straw than on a storm;                              360
    And when we think we lead, we are most led,[57]
    And still towards Death, a thing which comes as much
    Without our act or choice as birth, so that
    Methinks we must have sinned in some old world,
    And _this_ is Hell: the best is, that it is not
    Eternal.

    _Mar._ These are things we cannot judge
    On earth.

    _Doge_. And how then shall we judge each other,
    Who are all earth, and I, who am called upon
    To judge my son? I have administered
    My country faithfully--victoriously--                              370
    I dare them to the proof, the _chart_ of what
    She was and is: my reign has doubled realms;
    And, in reward, the gratitude of Venice
    Has left, or is about to leave, _me_ single.

    _Mar._ And Foscari? I do not think of such things,
    So I be left with him.

    _Doge_.               You shall be so;
    Thus much they cannot well deny.

    _Mar._                          And if
    They should, I will fly with him.

    _Doge_.                         That can ne'er be.
    And whither would you fly?

    _Mar._                    I know not, reck not--
    To Syria, Egypt, to the Ottoman--                                  380
    Any where, where we might respire unfettered,
    And live nor girt by spies, nor liable
    To edicts of inquisitors of state.

    _Doge_. What, wouldst thou have a renegade for husband,
    And turn him into traitor?

    _Mar._                    He is none!
    The Country is the traitress, which thrusts forth
    Her best and bravest from her. Tyranny
    Is far the worst of treasons. Dost thou deem
    None rebels except subjects? The Prince who
    Neglects or violates his trust is more                             390
    A brigand than the robber-chief.

    _Doge_.                          I cannot
    Charge me with such a breach of faith.

    _Mar_                                 No; thou
    Observ'st, obey'st such laws as make old Draco's
    A code of mercy by comparison.

    _Doge_. I found the law; I did not make it. Were I
    A subject, still I might find parts and portions
    Fit for amendment; but as Prince, I never
    Would change, for the sake of my house, the charter
    Left by our fathers.

    _Mar._              Did they make it for
    The ruin of their children?

    _Doge_.                    Under such laws, Venice                 400
    Has risen to what she is--a state to rival
    In deeds, and days, and sway, and, let me add,
    In glory (for we have had Roman spirits
    Amongst us), all that history has bequeathed
    Of Rome and Carthage in their best times, when
    The people swayed by Senates.

    _Mar._                       Rather say,
    Groaned under the stern Oligarchs.

    _Doge_.                           Perhaps so;
    But yet subdued the World: in such a state
    An individual, be he richest of
    Such rank as is permitted, or the meanest,                         410
    Without a name, is alike nothing, when
    The policy, irrevocably tending
    To one great end, must be maintained in vigour.

    _Mar._ This means that you are more a Doge than father.

    _Doge_. It means, I am more citizen than either.
    If we had not for many centuries
    Had thousands of such citizens, and shall,
    I trust, have still such, Venice were no city.

    _Mar._ Accursed be the city where the laws
    Would stifle Nature's!

    _Doge_.               Had I as many sons                           420
    As I have years, I would have given them all,
    Not without feeling, but I would have given them
    To the State's service, to fulfil her wishes,
    On the flood, in the field, or, if it must be,
    As it, alas! has been, to ostracism,
    Exile, or chains, or whatsoever worse
    She might decree.

    _Mar._           And this is Patriotism?
    To me it seems the worst barbarity.
    Let me seek out my husband: the sage "Ten,"
    With all its jealousy, will hardly war                             430
    So far with a weak woman as deny me
    A moment's access to his dungeon.

    _Doge_.                          I'll
    So far take on myself, as order that
    You may be admitted.

    _Mar._              And what shall I say
    To Foscari from his father?

    _Doge_.                    That he obey
    The laws.

    _Mar._   And nothing more? Will you not see him
    Ere he depart? It may be the last time.

    _Doge_. The last!--my boy!--the last time I shall see
    My last of children! Tell him I will come.                  [_Exeunt_.



                                 ACT III.


                SCENE I.--_The prison of_ JACOPO FOSCARI.

    _Jac. Fos._ (_solus_).
    No light, save yon faint gleam which shows me walls
    Which never echoed but to Sorrow's sounds,[58]
    The sigh of long imprisonment, the step
    Of feet on which the iron clanked the groan
    Of Death, the imprecation of Despair!
    And yet for this I have returned to Venice,
    With some faint hope, 'tis true, that Time, which wears
    The marble down, had worn away the hate
    Of men's hearts; but I knew them not, and here
    Must I consume my own, which never beat                             10
    For Venice but with such a yearning as
    The dove has for her distant nest, when wheeling
    High in the air on her return to greet
    Her callow brood. What letters are these which
                                                  [_Approaching the wall_.
    Are scrawled along the inexorable wall?
    Will the gleam let me trace them? Ah! the names
    Of my sad predecessors in this place,[59]
    The dates of their despair, the brief words of
    A grief too great for many. This stone page
    Holds like an epitaph their history;                                20
    And the poor captive's tale is graven on
    His dungeon barrier, like the lover's record
    Upon the bark of some tall tree,[60] which bears
    His own and his beloved's name. Alas!
    I recognise some names familiar to me,
    And blighted like to mine, which I will add,
    Fittest for such a chronicle as this,
    Which only can be read, as writ, by wretches.[bk]
                                                  [_He engraves his name_.

                     _Enter a Familiar of "the Ten."_

    _Fam._ I bring you food.

    _Jac. Fos._             I pray you set it down;
    I am past hunger: but my lips are parched--                         30
    The water!

    _Fam._    There.

    _Jac. Fos._ (_after drinking_). I thank you: I am better.

    _Fam._ I am commanded to inform you that
    Your further trial is postponed.

    _Jac. Fos._                     Till when?

    _Fam._ I know not.--It is also in my orders
    That your illustrious lady be admitted.

    _Jac. Fos._ Ah! they relent, then--I had ceased to hope it:
    'Twas time.

                             _Enter_ MARINA.

    _Mar._     My best beloved!

    _Jac. Fos._ (_embracing her_). My true wife,
    And only friend! What happiness!

    _Mar._                       We'll part
    No more.

    _Jac. Fos._ How! would'st thou share a dungeon?

    _Mar._                                         Aye,
    The rack, the grave, all--any thing with thee,                      40
    But the tomb last of all, for there we shall
    Be ignorant of each other, yet I will
    Share that--all things except new separation;
    It is too much to have survived the first.
    How dost thou? How are those worn limbs? Alas!
    Why do I ask? Thy paleness----

    _Jac. Fos._               'Tis the joy
    Of seeing thee again so soon, and so
    Without expectancy, has sent the blood
    Back to my heart, and left my cheeks like thine,
    For thou art pale too, my Marina!

    _Mar._                           'Tis                              50
    The gloom of this eternal cell, which never
    Knew sunbeam, and the sallow sullen glare
    Of the familiar's torch, which seems akin[bl]
    To darkness more than light, by lending to
    The dungeon vapours its bituminous smoke,
    Which cloud whate'er we gaze on, even thine eyes--
    No, not thine eyes--they sparkle--how they sparkle!

    _Jac. Fos._ And thine!--but I am blinded by the torch.

    _Mar._ As I had been without it. Couldst thou see here?

    _Jac. Fos._ Nothing at first; but use and time had taught me        60
    Familiarity with what was darkness;
    And the grey twilight of such glimmerings as
    Glide through the crevices made by the winds
    Was kinder to mine eyes than the full Sun,
    When gorgeously o'ergilding any towers
    Save those of Venice; but a moment ere
    Thou earnest hither I was busy writing.

    _Mar._ What?

    _Jac. Fos._   My name: look, 'tis there--recorded next
    The name of him who here preceded me,--
    If dungeon dates say true.

    _Mar._                    And what of him?                          70

    _Jac. Fos._ These walls are silent of men's ends; they only
    Seem to hint shrewdly of them. Such stern walls
    Were never piled on high save o'er the dead,
    Or those who soon must be so.--_What of him?_
    Thou askest.--What of me? may soon be asked,
    With the like answer--doubt and dreadful surmise--
    Unless thou tell'st my tale.

    _Mar._                     _I speak_ of thee!

    _Jac. Fos._ And wherefore not? All then shall speak of me:
    The tyranny of silence is not lasting,
    And, though events be hidden, just men's groans                     80
    Will burst all cerement, even a living grave's!
    I do not _doubt_ my memory, but my life;
    And neither do I fear.

    _Mar._                Thy life is safe.

    _Jac. Fos._ And liberty?

    _Mar._                  The mind should make its own!

    _Jac. Fos._ That has a noble sound; but 'tis a sound,
    A music most impressive, but too transient:
    The Mind is much, but is not all. The Mind
    Hath nerved me to endure the risk of death,
    And torture positive, far worse than death
    (If death be a deep sleep), without a groan,                        90
    Or with a cry which rather shamed my judges
    Than me; but 'tis not all, for there are things
    More woful--such as this small dungeon, where
    I may breathe many years.

    _Mar._                 Alas! and this
    Small dungeon is all that belongs to thee
    Of this wide realm, of which thy sire is Prince.

    _Jac. Fos._ That thought would scarcely aid me to endure it.
    My doom is common; many are in dungeons,
    But none like mine, so near their father's palace;
    But then my heart is sometimes high, and hope                      100
    Will stream along those moted rays of light
    Peopled with dusty atoms, which afford
    Our only day; for, save the gaoler's torch,
    And a strange firefly, which was quickly caught
    Last night in yon enormous spider's net,
    I ne'er saw aught here like a ray. Alas!
    I know if mind may bear us up, or no,
    For I have such, and shown it before men;
    It sinks in solitude: my soul is social.

    _Mar._ I will be with thee.

    _Jac. Fos._              Ah! if it were so!                        110
    But _that_ they never granted--nor will grant,
    And I shall be alone: no men; no books--
    Those lying likenesses of lying men.
    I asked for even those outlines of their kind,
    Which they term annals, history, what you will,
    Which men bequeath as portraits, and they were
    Refused me,--so these walls have been my study,
    More faithful pictures of Venetian story,
    With all their blank, or dismal stains, than is
    The Hall not far from hence, which bears on high                   120
    Hundreds of Doges, and their deeds and dates.

    _Mar._ I come to tell thee the result of their
    Last council on thy doom.

    _Jac. Fos._            I know it--look!

                     [_He points to his limbs, as referring to the Question
                         which he had undergone_.

    _Mar._ No--no--no more of that: even they relent
    From that atrocity.

    _Jac. Fos._      What then?

    _Mar._                       That you
    Return to Candia.

    _Jac. Fos._      Then my last hope's gone.
    I could endure my dungeon, for 'twas Venice;
    I could support the torture, there was something
    In my native air that buoyed my spirits up
    Like a ship on the Ocean tossed by storms,                         130
    But proudly still bestriding[61] the high waves,
    And holding on its course; but _there_, afar,
    In that accursed isle of slaves and captives,
    And unbelievers, like a stranded wreck,
    My very soul seemed mouldering in my bosom,
    And piecemeal I shall perish, if remanded.

    _Mar._ And _here_?

    _Jac. Fos._         At once--by better means, as briefer.[bm]
    What! would they even deny me my Sire's sepulchre,
    As well as home and heritage?

    _Mar._                       My husband!
    I have sued to accompany thee hence,                               140
    And not so hopelessly. This love of thine
    For an ungrateful and tyrannic soil
    Is Passion, and not Patriotism; for me,
    So I could see thee with a quiet aspect,
    And the sweet freedom of the earth and air,
    I would not cavil about climes or regions.
    This crowd of palaces and prisons is not
    A Paradise; its first inhabitants
    Were wretched exiles.

    _Jac. Fos._          Well I know _how_ wretched!

    _Mar._ And yet you see how, from their banishment                  150
    Before the Tartar into these salt isles,
    Their antique energy of mind, all that
    Remained of Rome for their inheritance,
    Created by degrees an ocean Rome;[62]
    And shall an evil, which so often leads
    To good, depress thee thus?

    _Jac. Fos._                Had I gone forth
    From my own land, like the old patriarchs, seeking
    Another region, with their flocks and herds;
    Had I been cast out like the Jews from Zion,
    Or like our fathers, driven by Attila[63]                          160
    From fertile Italy, to barren islets,
    I would have given some tears to my late country
    And many thoughts; but afterwards addressed
    Myself, with those about me, to create
    A new home and fresh state: perhaps I could
    Have borne this--though I know not.

    _Mar._                             Wherefore not?
    It was the lot of millions, and must be
    The fate of myriads more.

    _Jac. Fos._              Aye--we but hear
    Of the survivors' toil in their new lands,
    Their numbers and success; but who can number                      170
    The hearts which broke in silence at that parting,
    Or after their departure; of that malady[64]
    Which calls up green and native fields to view
    From the rough deep, with such identity
    To the poor exile's fevered eye, that he
    Can scarcely be restrained from treading them?
    That melody,[65] which out of tones and tunes[bn]
    Collects such pasture for the longing sorrow
    Of the sad mountaineer, when far away
    From his snow canopy of cliffs and clouds,                         180
    That he feeds on the sweet, but poisonous thought,
    And dies.[66] You call this _weakness_! It is strength,
    I say,--the parent of all honest feeling.
    He who loves not his Country, can love nothing.

    _Mar._ Obey her, then: 'tis she that puts thee forth.

    _Jac. Fos._ Aye, there it is; 'tis like a mother's curse
    Upon my soul--the mark is set upon me.
    The exiles you speak of went forth by nations,
    Their hands upheld each other by the way,
    Their tents were pitched together--I'm alone.                      190

    _Mar._ You shall be so no more--I will go with thee.

    _Jac. Fos._ My best Marina!--and our children?

    _Mar._                                        They,
    I fear, by the prevention of the state's
    Abhorrent policy, (which holds all ties
    As threads, which may be broken at her pleasure),
    Will not be suffered to proceed with us.

    _Jac. Fos._ And canst thou leave them?

    _Mar._                                Yes--with many a pang!
    But--I _can_ leave them, children as they are,
    To teach you to be less a child. From this
    Learn you to sway your feelings, when exacted                      200
    By duties paramount; and 'tis our first
    On earth to bear.

    _Jac. Fos._      Have I not borne?

    _Mar._                            Too much
    From tyrannous injustice, and enough
    To teach you not to shrink now from a lot,
    Which, as compared with what you have undergone
    Of late, is mercy.

    _Jac. Fos._       Ah! you never yet
    Were far away from Venice, never saw
    Her beautiful towers in the receding distance,
    While every furrow of the vessel's track
    Seemed ploughing deep into your heart; you never                   210
    Saw day go down upon your native spires[bo]
    So calmly with its gold and crimson glory,
    And after dreaming a disturbed vision
    Of them and theirs, awoke and found them not.

    _Mar._ I will divide this with you. Let us think
    Of our departure from this much-loved city,
    (Since you must _love_ it, as it seems,) and this
    Chamber of state, her gratitude allots you.
    Our children will be cared for by the Doge,
    And by my uncles; we must sail ere night.                          220

    _Jac. Fos._ That's sudden. Shall I not behold my father?

    _Mar._ You will.

    _Jac. Fos._     Where?

    _Mar._                Here, or in the ducal chamber--
    He said not which. I would that you could bear
    Your exile as he bears it.

    _Jac. Fos._               Blame him not.
    I sometimes murmur for a moment; but
    He could not now act otherwise. A show
    Of feeling or compassion on his part
    Would have but drawn upon his aged head
    Suspicion from "the Ten," and upon mine
    Accumulated ills.

    _Mar._           Accumulated!                                      230
    What pangs are those they have spared you?

    _Jac. Fos._                               That of leaving
    Venice without beholding him or you,
    Which might have been forbidden now, as 'twas
    Upon my former exile.

    _Mar._               That is true,
    And thus far I am also the State's debtor,
    And shall be more so when I see us both
    Floating on the free waves--away--away--
    Be it to the earth's end, from this abhorred,
    Unjust, and----

    _Jac. Fos._    Curse it not. If I am silent,
    Who dares accuse my Country?

    _Mar._                     Men and Angels!                         240
    The blood of myriads reeking up to Heaven,
    The groans of slaves in chains, and men in dungeons,
    Mothers, and wives, and sons, and sires, and subjects,
    Held in the bondage of ten bald-heads; and
    Though last, not least, _thy silence! Couldst thou_ say
    Aught in its favour, who would praise like _thee_?

    _Jac. Fos._ Let us address us then, since so it must be,
    To our departure. Who comes here?

                _Enter_ LOREDANO _attended by Familiars_.

    _Lor._ (_to the Familiars_).       Retire,
    But leave the torch.                      [_Exeunt the two Familiars_.

    _Jac. Fos._         Most welcome, noble Signor.
    I did not deem this poor place could have drawn                    250
    Such presence hither.

    _Lor._               'Tis not the first time
    I have visited these places.

    _Mar._                      Nor would be
    The last, were all men's merits well rewarded.
    Came you here to insult us, or remain[bp]
    As spy upon us, or as hostage for us?

    _Lor._ Neither are of my office, noble Lady!
    I am sent hither to your husband, to
    Announce "the Ten's" decree.

    _Mar._                      That tenderness
    Has been anticipated: it is known.

    _Lor._ As how?

    _Mar._         I have informed him, not so gently,                 260
    Doubtless, as your nice feelings would prescribe,
    The indulgence of your colleagues; but he knew it.
    If you come for our thanks, take them, and hence!
    The dungeon gloom is deep enough without you,
    And full of reptiles, not less loathsome, though
    Their sting is honester.

    _Jac. Fos._             I pray you, calm you:
    What can avail such words?

    _Mar._                   To let him know
    That he is known.

    _Lor._           Let the fair dame preserve
    Her sex's privilege.

    _Mar._              I have some sons, sir,
    Will one day thank you better.

    _Lor._                        You do well                          270
    To nurse them wisely. Foscari--you know
    Your sentence, then?

    _Jac. Fos._        Return to Candia?

    _Lor._                               True--
    For life.

    _Jac. Fos._ Not long.

    _Lor._               I said--for _life_.

    _Jac. Fos._                              And I
    Repeat--not long.

    _Lor._        A year's imprisonment
    In Canea--afterwards the freedom of
    The whole isle.

    _Jac. Fos._      Both the same to me: the after
    Freedom as is the first imprisonment.
    Is't true my wife accompanies me?

    _Lor._                           Yes,
    If she so wills it.

    _Mar._             Who obtained that justice?

    _Lor._ One who wars not with women.

    _Mar._                              But oppresses                  280
    Men: howsoever let him have _my_ thanks
    For the only boon I would have asked or taken
    From him or such as he is.

    _Lor._                    He receives them
    As they are offered.

    _Mar._              May they thrive with him
    So much!--no more.

    _Jac. Fos._        Is this, sir, your whole mission?
    Because we have brief time for preparation,
    And you perceive your presence doth disquiet
    This lady, of a house noble as yours.

    _Mar._ Nobler!

    _Lor._          How nobler?

    _Mar._                     As more generous!
    We say the "generous steed" to express the purity 290
    Of his high blood. Thus much I've learnt, although
    Venetian (who see few steeds save of bronze),[67]
    From those Venetians who have skirred[68] the coasts
    Of Egypt and her neighbour Araby:
    And why not say as soon the "_generous man_?"
    If race be aught, it is in qualities
    More than in years; and mine, which is as old
    As yours, is better in its product, nay--
    Look not so stern--but get you back, and pore
    Upon your genealogic tree's most green                             300
    Of leaves and most mature of fruits, and there
    Blush to find ancestors, who would have blushed
    For such a son--thou cold inveterate hater!

    _Jac. Fos._ Again, Marina!

    _Mar._                       Again! _still_, Marina.
    See you not, he comes here to glut his hate
    With a last look upon our misery?
    Let him partake it!

    _Jac. Fos._       That were difficult.

    _Mar._ Nothing more easy. He partakes it now--
    Aye, he may veil beneath a marble brow
    And sneering lip the pang, but he partakes it.                     310
    A few brief words of truth shame the Devil's servants
    No less than Master; I have probed his soul
    A moment, as the Eternal Fire, ere long,
    Will reach it always. See how he shrinks from me!
    With death, and chains, and exile in his hand,
    To scatter o'er his kind as he thinks fit;
    They are his weapons, not his armour, for
    I have pierced him to the core of his cold heart.
    I care not for his frowns! We can but die,
    And he but live, for him the very worst                            320
    Of destinies: each day secures him more
    His tempter's.

    _Jac. Fos._     This is mere insanity.

    _Mar._ It may be so; and _who_ hath made us _mad_?

    _Lor._ Let her go on; it irks not me.

    _Mar._                                 That's false!
    You came here to enjoy a heartless triumph
    Of cold looks upon manifold griefs! You came
    To be sued to in vain--to mark our tears,
    And hoard our groans--to gaze upon the wreck
    Which you have made a Prince's son--my husband;
    In short, to trample on the fallen--an office                      330
    The hangman shrinks from, as all men from him!
    How have you sped? We are wretched, Signor, as
    Your plots could make, and vengeance could desire us,
    And how _feel you_?

    _Lor._             As rocks.

    _Mar._                       By thunder blasted:
    They feel not, but no less are shivered. Come,
    Foscari; now let us go, and leave this felon,
    The sole fit habitant of such a cell,
    Which he has peopled often, but ne'er fitly
    Till he himself shall brood in it alone.

                            _Enter the_ DOGE.

    _Jac. Fos._ My father!

    _Doge_ (_embracing him_). Jacopo! my son--my son!                  340

    _Jac. Fos._ My father still! How long it is since I
    Have heard thee name my name--_our_ name!

    _Doge_.                                  My boy!
    Couldst thou but know----

    _Jac. Fos._              I rarely, sir, have murmured.

    _Doge_. I feel too much thou hast not.

    _Mar._                                Doge, look there!
                                                [_She points to_ LOREDANO.

    _Doge_. I see the man--what mean'st thou?

    _Mar._                                   Caution!

    _Lor._                                           Being
    The virtue which this noble lady most[bq]
    May practise, she doth well to recommend it.

    _Mar._ Wretch! 'tis no virtue, but the policy
    Of those who fain must deal perforce with vice:
    As such I recommend it, as I would                                 350
    To one whose foot was on an adder's path.

    _Doge_. Daughter, it is superfluous; I have long
    Known Loredano.

    _Lor._         You may know him better.

    _Mar._ Yes; _worse_ he could not.

    _Jac. Fos._                      Father, let not these
    Our parting hours be lost in listening to
    Reproaches, which boot nothing. Is it--is it,
    Indeed, our last of meetings?

    _Doge_.                      You behold
    These white hairs!

    _Jac. Fos._     And I feel, besides, that mine
    Will never be so white. Embrace me, father!
    I loved you ever--never more than now.                             360
    Look to my children--to your last child's children:
    Let them be all to you which he was once,
    And never be to you what I am now.
    May I not see _them_ also?

    _Mar._                    No--not _here_.

    _Jac. Fos._ They might behold their parent any where.

    _Mar._ I would that they beheld their father in
    A place which would not mingle fear with love,
    To freeze their young blood in its natural current.
    They have fed well, slept soft, and knew not that
    Their sire was a mere hunted outlaw. Well,                         370
    I know his fate may one day be their heritage,
    But let it only be their _heritage_,
    And not their present fee. Their senses, though
    Alive to love, are yet awake to terror;
    And these vile damps, too, and yon _thick green_ wave
    Which floats above the place where we now stand--
    A cell so far below the water's level,
    Sending its pestilence through every crevice,
    Might strike them: _this is not their_ atmosphere,
    However you--and you--and most of all,                             380
    As worthiest--_you_, sir, noble Loredano!
    May breathe it without prejudice.

    _Jac. Fos._                      I had not
    Reflected upon this, but acquiesce.
    I shall depart, then, without meeting them?

    _Doge_. Not so: they shall await you in my chamber.

    _Jac. Fos._ And must I leave them--_all_?

    _Lor._                                    You must.

    _Jac. Fos._                                        Not one?

    _Lor._ They are the State's.

    _Mar._                      I thought they had been mine.

    _Lor._ They are, in all maternal things.

    _Mar._                                   That is,
    In all things painful. If they're sick, they will
    Be left to me to tend them; should they die,                       390
    To me to bury and to mourn; but if
    They live, they'll make you soldiers, senators,
    Slaves, exiles--what _you_ will; or if they are
    Females with portions, brides and _bribes_ for nobles!
    Behold the State's care for its sons and mothers!

    _Lor._ The hour approaches, and the wind is fair.

    _Jac. Fos._ How know you that here, where the genial wind
    Ne'er blows in all its blustering freedom?

    _Lor._                                   'Twas so
    When I came here. The galley floats within
    A bow-shot of the "Riva di Schiavoni." 400

    _Jac. Fos._ Father! I pray you to precede me, and
    Prepare my children to behold their father.

    _Doge_. Be firm, my son!

    _Jac. Fos._             I will do my endeavour.

    _Mar._ Farewell! at least to this detested dungeon,
    And him to whose good offices you owe
    In part your past imprisonment.

    _Lor._                         And present
    Liberation.

    _Doge_.    He speaks truth.

    _Jac. Fos._                No doubt! but 'tis
    Exchange of chains for heavier chains I owe him.
    He knows this, or he had not sought to change them,
    But I reproach not.

    _Lor._           The time narrows, Signor.                         410

    _Jac. Fos._ Alas! I little thought so lingeringly
    To leave abodes like this: but when I feel
    That every step I take, even from this cell,
    Is one away from Venice, I look back
    Even on these dull damp walls, and----

    _Doge_.                               Boy! no tears.

    _Mar._ Let them flow on: he wept not on the rack
    To shame him, and they cannot shame him now.
    They will relieve his heart--that too kind heart--
    And I will find an hour to wipe away
    Those tears, or add my own. I could weep now,                      420
    But would not gratify yon wretch so far.
    Let us proceed. Doge, lead the way.

    _Lor._ (_to the Familiar_).        The torch, there!

    _Mar._ Yes, light us on, as to a funeral pyre,
    With Loredano mourning like an heir.

    _Doge_. My son, you are feeble; take this hand.

    _Jac. Fos._                                    Alas!
    Must youth support itself on age, and I
    Who ought to be the prop of yours?

    _Lor._                            Take mine.

    _Mar._ Touch it not, Foscari; 'twill sting you. Signor,
    Stand off! be sure, that if a grasp of yours
    Would raise us from the gulf wherein we are plunged,               430
    No hand of ours would stretch itself to meet it.
    Come, Foscari, take the hand the altar gave you;
    It could not save, but will support you ever.               [_Exeunt_.




                                 ACT IV.

                 SCENE I.--_A Hall in the Ducal Palace_.

                    _Enter_ LOREDANO _and_ BARBARIGO.

    _Bar._ And have you confidence in such a project?

    _Lor._ I have.

    _Bar._         'Tis hard upon his years.

    _Lor._                                  Say rather
    Kind to relieve him from the cares of State.

    _Bar._ 'Twill break his heart.

    _Lor._                        Age has no heart to break.
    He has seen his son's half broken, and, except
    A start of feeling in his dungeon, never
    Swerved.

    _Bar._   In his countenance, I grant you, never;
    But I have seen him sometimes in a calm
    So desolate, that the most clamorous grief
    Had nought to envy him within. Where is he?                         10

    _Lor._ In his own portion of the palace, with
    His son, and the whole race of Foscaris.

    _Bar._ Bidding farewell.

    _Lor._                   A last! as, soon, he shall
    Bid to his Dukedom.

    _Bar._             When embarks the son?

    _Lor._ Forthwith--when this long leave is taken. 'Tis
    Time to admonish them again.

    _Bar._                      Forbear;
    Retrench not from their moments.

    _Lor._                          Not I, now
    We have higher business for our own. This day
    Shall be the last of the old Doge's reign,
    As the first of his son's last banishment,                          20
    And that is vengeance.

    _Bar._                In my mind, too deep.

    _Lor._ 'Tis moderate--not even life for life, the rule
    Denounced of retribution from all time;
    They owe me still my father's and my uncle's.

    _Bar._ Did not the Doge deny this strongly?

    _Lor._                                      Doubtless.

    _Bar._ And did not this shake your suspicion?

    _Lor._                                        No.

    _Bar._ But if this deposition should take place
    By our united influence in the Council,
    It must be done with all the deference
    Due to his years, his station, and his deeds.                       30

    _Lor._ As much of ceremony as you will,
    So that the thing be done. You may, for aught
    I care, depute the Council on their knees,
    (Like Barbarossa to the Pope,) to beg him
    To have the courtesy to abdicate.

    _Bar._ What if he will not?

    _Lor._                      We'll elect another,
    And make him null.

    _Bar._            But will the laws uphold us?[69]

    _Lor._ What laws?--"The Ten" are laws; and if they were not,
    I will be legislator in this business.

    _Bar._ At your own peril?

    _Lor._                   There is none, I tell you,                 40
    Our powers are such.

    _Bar._              But he has twice already
    Solicited permission to retire,
    And twice it was refused.

    _Lor._                  The better reason
    To grant it the third time.

    _Bar._                     Unasked?

    _Lor._                             It shows
    The impression of his former instances:
    If they were from his heart, he may be thankful:
    If not, 'twill punish his hypocrisy.
    Come, they are met by this time; let us join them,
    And be _thou_ fixed in purpose for this once.
    I have prepared such arguments as will not                          50
    Fail to move them, and to remove him: since
    Their thoughts, their objects, have been sounded, do not
    _You_, with your wonted scruples, teach us pause,
    And all will prosper.

    _Bar._               Could I but be certain
    This is no prelude to such persecution
    Of the sire as has fallen upon the son,
    I would support you.

    _Lor._              He is safe, I tell you;
    His fourscore years and five may linger on
    As long as he can drag them: 'tis his throne
    Alone is aimed at.

    _Bar._            But discarded Princes                              60
    Are seldom long of life.

    _Lor._                  And men of eighty
    More seldom still.

    _Bar._            And why not wait these few years?

    _Lor._ Because we have waited long enough, and he
    Lived longer than enough. Hence! in to council!
                                       [_Exeunt_ LOREDANO _and_ BARBARIGO.

                    _Enter_ MEMMO[70] _and a Senator_.

    _Sen._ A summons to "the Ten!" why so?

    _Mem._                               "The Ten"
    Alone can answer; they are rarely wont
    To let their thoughts anticipate their purpose
    By previous proclamation. We are summoned--
    That is enough.

    _Sen._         For them, but not for us;
    I would know why.

    _Mem._          You will know why anon,                             70
    If you obey: and, if not, you no less
    Will know why you should have obeyed.

    _Sen._                               I mean not
    To oppose them, _but_----

    _Mem._                  In Venice "_but_"'s a traitor.
    But me no "_buts_" unless you would pass o'er
    The Bridge which few repass.[71]

    _Sen._                      I am silent.

    _Mem._                                  Why
    Thus hesitate? "The Ten" have called in aid
    Of their deliberation five and twenty
    Patricians of the Senate--you are one,
    And I another; and it seems to me
    Both honoured by the choice or chance which leads us                80
    To mingle with a body so august.

    _Sen._ Most true. I say no more.

    _Mem._                          As we hope, Signor,
    And all may honestly, (that is, all those
    Of noble blood may,) one day hope to be
    Decemvir, it is surely for the Senate's[br]
    Chosen delegates, a school of wisdom, to
    Be thus admitted, though as novices,
    To view the mysteries.

    _Sen._                Let us view them: they,
    No doubt, are worth it.

    _Mem._                 Being worth our lives
    If we divulge them, doubtless they are worth                        90
    Something, at least to you or me.

    _Sen._                           I sought not
    A place within the sanctuary; but being
    Chosen, however reluctantly so chosen,
    I shall fulfil my office.

    _Mem._                   Let us not
    Be latest in obeying "the Ten's" summons.

    _Sen._ All are not met, but I am of your thought
    So far--let's in.

    _Mem._          The earliest are most welcome
    In earnest councils--we will not be least so.               [_Exeunt_.

             _Enter the_ DOGE, JACOPO FOSCARI, _and_ MARINA.

    _Jac. Fos._ Ah, father! though I must and will depart,
    Yet--yet--I pray you to obtain for me                              100
    That I once more return unto my home,
    Howe'er remote the period. Let there be
    A point of time, as beacon to my heart,
    With any penalty annexed they please,
    But let me still return.

    _Doge_.                 Son Jacopo,
    Go and obey our Country's will:[72] 'tis not
    For us to look beyond.

    _Jac. Fos._        But still I must
    Look back. I pray you think of me.

    _Doge_.                           Alas!
    You ever were my dearest offspring, when
    They were more numerous, nor can be less so                        110
    Now you are last; but did the State demand
    The exile of the disinterred ashes
    Of your three goodly brothers, now in earth,[73]
    And their desponding shades came flitting round
    To impede the act, I must no less obey
    A duty, paramount to every duty.

    _Mar._ My husband! let us on: this but prolongs
    Our sorrow.

    _Jac. Fos._ But we are not summoned yet;
    The galley's sails are not unfurled:--who knows?
    The wind may change.

    _Mar._              And if it do, it will not                      120
    Change _their_ hearts, or your lot: the galley's oars
    Will quickly clear the harbour.

    _Jac. Fos._                    O, ye Elements!
    Where are your storms?

    _Mar._                In human breasts. Alas!
    Will nothing calm you?

    _Jac. Fos._           Never yet did mariner
    Put up to patron saint such prayers for prosperous
    And pleasant breezes, as I call upon you,
    Ye tutelar saints of my own city! which
    Ye love not with more holy love than I,
    To lash up from the deep the Adrian waves,
    And waken Auster, sovereign of the Tempest!                        130
    Till the sea dash me back on my own shore
    A broken corse upon the barren Lido,
    Where I may mingle with the sands which skirt
    The land I love, and never shall see more!

    _Mar._ And wish you this with _me_ beside you?

    _Jac. Fos._                                   No--
    No--not for thee, too good, too kind! May'st thou
    Live long to be a mother to those children
    Thy fond fidelity for a time deprives
    Of such support! But for myself alone,
    May all the winds of Heaven howl down the Gulf,                    140
    And tear the vessel, till the mariners,
    Appalled, turn their despairing eyes on me,
    As the Phenicians did on Jonah, then
    Cast me out from amongst them, as an offering
    To appease the waves. The billow which destroys me
    Will be more merciful than man, and bear me
    Dead, but _still bear_ me to a native grave,
    From fishers' hands, upon the desolate strand,
    Which, of its thousand wrecks, hath ne'er received
    One lacerated like the heart which then                            150
    Will be.--But wherefore breaks it not? why live I?

    _Mar._ To man thyself, I trust, with time, to master
    Such useless passion. Until now thou wert
    A sufferer, but not a loud one: why
    What is this to the things thou hast borne in silence--
    Imprisonment and actual torture?

    _Jac. Fos._                     Double,
    Triple, and tenfold torture! But you are right,
    It must be borne. Father, your blessing.

    _Doge_.                             Would
    It could avail thee! but no less thou hast it.

    _Jac. Fos._ Forgive----

    _Doge_.                What?

    _Jac. Fos._                  My poor mother, for my birth,         160
    And me for having lived, and you yourself
    (As I forgive you), for the gift of life,
    Which you bestowed upon me as my sire.

    _Mar._   What hast thou done?

    _Jac. Fos._                  Nothing. I cannot charge
    My memory with much save sorrow: but
    I have been so beyond the common lot
    Chastened and visited, I needs must think
    That I was wicked. If it be so, may
    What I have undergone here keep me from
    A like hereafter!

    _Mar._           Fear not: _that's_ reserved                       170
    For your oppressors.

    _Jac. Fos._         Let me hope not.

    _Mar._                               Hope not?

    _Jac. Fos._ I cannot wish them _all_ they have inflicted.

    _Mar._ _All!_ the consummate fiends! A thousandfold
    May the worm which never dieth feed upon them!

    _Jac. Fos._ They may repent.

    _Mar._                       And if they do, Heaven will not
    Accept the tardy penitence of demons.

                      _Enter an Officer and Guards_.

    _Offi._ Signor! the boat is at the shore--the wind
    Is rising--we are ready to attend you.

    _Jac. Fos._ And I to be attended. Once more, father,
    Your hand!

    _Doge_.   Take it. Alas! how thine own trembles!                   180

    _Jac. Fos._ No--you mistake; 'tis yours that shakes, my father.
    Farewell!

    _Doge_.  Farewell! Is there aught else?

    _Jac. Fos._                            No--nothing.
                                                        [_To the Officer_.
    Lend me your arm, good Signor.

    _Offi._                       You turn pale--
    Let me support you--paler--ho! some aid there!
    Some water!

    _Mar._      Ah, he is dying!

    _Jac. Fos._                  Now, I'm ready--
    My eyes swim strangely--where's the door?

    _Mar._                               Away!
    Let me support him--my best love! Oh, God!
    How faintly beats this heart--this pulse!

    _Jac. Fos._                              The light!
    _Is_ it the light?--I am faint.
                                       [_Officer presents him with water_.

    _Offi._                       He will be better,
    Perhaps, in the air.

    _Jac. Fos._          I doubt not. Father--wife--                   190
    Your hands!

    _Mar._      There's death in that damp, clammy grasp.[74]
    Oh, God!--My Foscari, how fare you?

    _Jac. Fos._                         Well!                  [_He dies_.

    _Offi._ He's gone!

    _Doge_.            He's free.

    _Mar._                       No--no, he is not dead;
    There must be life yet in that heart--he could not[bs]
    Thus leave me.

    _Doge_.        Daughter!

    _Mar._                  Hold thy peace, old man!
    I am no daughter now--thou hast no son.
    Oh, Foscari!

    _Offi._       We must remove the body.

    _Mar._ Touch it not, dungeon miscreants! your base office
    Ends with his life, and goes not beyond murder,
    Even by your murderous laws. Leave his remains                     200
    To those who know to honour them.

    _Offi._                           I must
    Inform the Signory, and learn their pleasure.

    _Doge_. Inform the Signory from _me_, the Doge,
    They have no further power upon those ashes:
    While he lived, he was theirs, as fits a subject--
    Now he is _mine_--my broken-hearted boy!              [_Exit Officer_.

    _Mar._ And I must live!

    _Doge_.                 Your children live, Marina.

    _Mar._ My children! true--they live, and I must live
    To bring them up to serve the State, and die
    As died their father. Oh! what best of blessings                   210
    Were barrenness in Venice! Would my mother
    Had been so!

    _Doge_.      My unhappy children!

    _Mar._                           What!
    _You_ feel it then at last--_you!_--Where is now
    The Stoic of the State?

    _Doge_ (_throwing himself down by the body_). _Here!_

    _Mar._                                         Aye, weep on!
    I thought you had no tears--you hoarded them
    Until they are useless; but weep on! he never
    Shall weep more--never, never more.

                    _Enter_ LOREDANO _and_ BARBARIGO.

    _Lor._                          What's here?

    _Mar._ Ah! the Devil come to insult the dead! Avaunt!
    Incarnate Lucifer! 'tis holy ground.
    A martyr's ashes now lie there, which make it                      220
    A shrine. Get thee back to thy place of torment!

    _Bar._ Lady, we knew not of this sad event,
    But passed here merely on our path from council.

    _Mar._ Pass on.

    _Lor._          We sought the Doge.

    _Mar._ (_pointing to the Doge, who is still on the ground
    by his son's body_)                 He's busy, look,
    About the business _you_ provided for him.
    Are ye content?

    _Bar._         We will not interrupt
    A parent's sorrows.

    _Mar._             No, ye only make them,
    Then leave them.

    _Doge_ (_rising_). Sirs, I am ready.

    _Bar._                              No--not now.

    _Lor._ Yet 'twas important.

    _Doge_.                     If 'twas so, I can
    Only repeat--I am ready.

    _Bar._                  It shall not be                            230
    Just now, though Venice tottered o'er the deep
    Like a frail vessel. I respect your griefs.

    _Doge_. I thank you. If the tidings which you bring
    Are evil, you may say them; nothing further
    Can touch me more than him thou look'st on there;
    If they be good, say on; you need not _fear_
    That they can _comfort_ me.

    _Bar._                      I would they could!

    _Doge_. I spoke not to _you_, but to Loredano.
    _He_ understands me.

    _Mar._               Ah! I thought it would be so.

    _Doge_. What mean you?

    _Mar._                 Lo! there is the blood beginning            240
    To flow through the dead lips of Foscari--
    The body bleeds in presence of the assassin.
                                                           [_To_ LOREDANO.
    Thou cowardly murderer by law, behold
    How Death itself bears witness to thy deeds!

    _Doge_. My child! this is a phantasy of grief.
    Bear hence the body. [_To his attendants_] Signors, if it please you,
    Within an hour I'll hear you.

                          [_Exeunt_ DOGE, MARINA, _and attendants with the
                             body_. _Manent_ LOREDANO _and_ BARBARIGO.

    _Bar._                       He must not
    Be troubled now.


    _Lor._            He said himself that nought
    Could give him trouble farther.

    _Bar._                         These are words;
    But Grief is lonely, and the breaking in                           250
    Upon it barbarous.

    _Lor._             Sorrow preys upon
    Its solitude, and nothing more diverts it
    From its sad visions of the other world,
    Than calling it at moments back to this.
    The busy have no time for tears.

    _Bar._                           And therefore
    You would deprive this old man of all business?

    _Lor._ The thing's decreed. The Giunta[75] and "the Ten"
    Have made it law--who shall oppose that law?

    _Bar._ Humanity!

    _Lor._           Because his son is dead?

    _Bar._ And yet unburied.

    _Lor._                  Had we known this when                     260
    The act was passing, it might have suspended
    Its passage, but impedes it not--once passed.

    _Bar._ I'll not consent.

    _Lor._                  You have consented to
    All that's essential--leave the rest to me.

    _Bar._ Why press his abdication now?

    _Lor._                              The feelings
    Of private passion may not interrupt
    The public benefit; and what the State
    Decides to-day must not give way before
    To-morrow for a natural accident.

    _Bar._ You have a son.

    _Lor._                 I _have_--and _had_ a father.               270

    _Bar._ Still so inexorable?

    _Lor._                      Still.

    _Bar._                            But let him
    Inter his son before we press upon him
    This edict.

    _Lor._     Let him call up into life
    My sire and uncle--I consent. Men may,
    Even aged men, be, or appear to be,
    Sires of a hundred sons, but cannot kindle
    An atom of their ancestors from earth.
    The victims are not equal; he has seen
    His sons expire by natural deaths, and I
    My sires by violent and mysterious maladies.                       280
    I used no poison, bribed no subtle master
    Of the destructive art of healing, to
    Shorten the path to the eternal cure.
    His sons--and he had four--are dead, without
    _My_ dabbling in vile drugs.

    _Bar._                       And art thou sure
    He dealt in such?

    _Lor._           Most sure.

    _Bar._                     And yet he seems
    All openness.

    _Lor._         And so he seemed not long
    Ago to Carmagnuola.

    _Bar._              The attainted
    And foreign traitor?

    _Lor._               Even so: when _he_,
    After the very night in which "the Ten" 290
    (Joined with the Doge) decided his destruction,
    Met the great Duke at daybreak with a jest,
    Demanding whether he should augur him
    "The good day or good night?" his Doge-ship answered,
    "That he in truth had passed a night of vigil,
    In which" (he added with a gracious smile)
    "There often has been question about you."[76]
    'Twas true; the question was the death resolved
    Of Carmagnuola, eight months ere he died;
    And the old Doge, who knew him doomed, smiled on him               300
    With deadly cozenage, eight long months beforehand--
    Eight months of such hypocrisy as is
    Learnt but in eighty years. Brave Carmagnuola
    Is dead; so is young Foscari and his brethren--
    I never _smiled_ on _them_.

    _Bar._                        Was Carmagnuola
    Your friend?

    _Lor._       He was the safeguard of the city.
    In early life its foe, but in his manhood,
    Its saviour first, then victim.

    _Bar._                          Ah! that seems
    The penalty of saving cities. He
    Whom we now act against not only saved                             310
    Our own, but added others to her sway.

    _Lor._ The Romans (and we ape them) gave a crown
    To him who took a city: and they gave
    A crown to him who saved a citizen
    In battle: the rewards are equal. Now,
    If we should measure forth the cities taken
    By the Doge Foscari, with citizens
    Destroyed by him, or _through_ him, the account
    Were fearfully against him, although narrowed
    To private havoc, such as between him                              320
    And my dead father.

    _Bar._               Are you then thus fixed?

    _Lor._ Why, what should change me?

    _Bar._                             That which changes me.
    But you, I know, are marble to retain
    A feud. But when all is accomplished, when
    The old man is deposed, his name degraded,
    His sons all dead, his family depressed,
    And you and yours triumphant, shall you sleep?

    _Lor._ More soundly.

    _Bar._               That's an error, and you'll find it
    Ere you sleep with your fathers.

    _Lor._                          They sleep not
    In their accelerated graves, nor will                              330
    Till Foscari fills his. Each night I see them
    Stalk frowning round my couch, and, pointing towards
    The ducal palace, marshal me to vengeance.

    _Bar._ Fancy's distemperature! There is no passion
    More spectral or fantastical than Hate;
    Not even its opposite, Love, so peoples air
    With phantoms, as this madness of the heart.

                           _Enter an Officer_.

    _Lor._ Where go you, sirrah?

    _Offi._                      By the ducal order
    To forward the preparatory rites
    For the late Foscari's interment.

    _Bar._                           Their                             340
    Vault has been often opened of late years.

    _Lor._ 'Twill be full soon, and may be closed for ever!

    _Offi._ May I pass on?

    _Lor._                 You may.

    _Bar._                         How bears the Doge
    This last calamity?

    _Offi._             With desperate firmness.
    In presence of another he says little,
    But I perceive his lips move now and then;
    And once or twice I heard him, from the adjoining
    Apartment, mutter forth the words--"My son!"
    Scarce audibly. I must proceed.                       [_Exit Officer_.

    _Bar._                          This stroke
    Will move all Venice in his favour.

    _Lor._                              Right!                         350
    We must be speedy: let us call together
    The delegates appointed to convey
    The Council's resolution.

    _Bar._                    I protest
    Against it at this moment.

    _Lor._                     As you please--
    I'll take their voices on it ne'ertheless,
    And see whose most may sway them, yours or mine.
                                       [_Exeunt_ BARBARIGO _and_ LOREDANO.




                                  ACT V.


                    SCENE I.--_The_ DOGE'S _Apartment_.

                       _The_ DOGE _and Attendants_.

    _Att._ My Lord, the deputation is in waiting;
    But add, that if another hour would better
    Accord with your will, they will make it theirs.

    _Doge_. To me all hours are like. Let them approach.
                                                        [_Exit Attendant_.

    _An Officer_. Prince! I have done your bidding.

    _Doge_.                                          What command?

    _Offi._ A melancholy one--to call the attendance
    Of----

    _Doge_. True--true--true: I crave your pardon. I
    Begin to fail in apprehension, and
    Wax very old--old almost as my years.
    Till now I fought them off, but they begin                          10
    To overtake me.

         _Enter the Deputation, consisting of six of the Signory
                        and the Chief of the Ten_.

                    Noble men, your pleasure!

    _Chief of the Ten_. In the first place, the Council doth condole
    With the Doge on his late and private grief.

    _Doge_. No more--no more of that.

    _Chief of the Ten_.                Will not the Duke
    Accept the homage of respect?

    _Doge_.                       I do
    Accept it as 'tis given--proceed.

    _Chief of the Ten_.              "The Ten,"
    With a selected giunta from the Senate
    Of twenty-five of the best born patricians,
    Having deliberated on the state
    Of the Republic, and the o'erwhelming cares                         20
    Which, at this moment, doubly must oppress
    Your years, so long devoted to your Country,
    Have judged it fitting, with all reverence,
    Now to solicit from your wisdom (which
    Upon reflection must accord in this),
    The resignation of the ducal ring,
    Which you have worn so long and venerably:
    And to prove that they are not ungrateful, nor
    Cold to your years and services, they add
    An appanage of twenty hundred golden                                30
    Ducats, to make retirement not less splendid
    Than should become a Sovereign's retreat.

    _Doge_. Did I hear rightly?

    _Chief of the Ten_.          Need I say again?

    _Doge_. No.--Have you done?

    _Chief of the Ten_.         I have spoken. Twenty four[77]
    Hours are accorded you to give an answer.

    _Doge_. I shall not need so many seconds.

    _Chief of the Ten_.                        We
    Will now retire.

    _Doge_.          Stay! four and twenty hours
    Will alter nothing which I have to say.

    _Chief of the Ten_. Speak!

    _Doge_.                    When I twice before reiterated
    My wish to abdicate, it was refused me:                             40
    And not alone refused, but ye exacted
    An oath from me that I would never more
    Renew this instance. I have sworn to die
    In full exertion of the functions, which
    My Country called me here to exercise,
    According to my honour and my conscience--
    I cannot break _my_ oath.

    _Chief of the Ten_.      Reduce us not
    To the alternative of a decree,
    Instead of your compliance.

    _Doge_.                    Providence
    Prolongs my days to prove and chasten me;                           50
    But ye have no right to reproach my length
    Of days, since every hour has been the Country's.
    I am ready to lay down my life for her,
    As I have laid down dearer things than life:
    But for my dignity--I hold it of
    The _whole_ Republic: when the _general_ will
    Is manifest, then you shall all be answered.

    _Chief of the Ten_. We grieve for such an answer; but it cannot
    Avail you aught.

    _Doge_.         I can submit to all things,
    But nothing will advance; no, not a moment.                         60
    What you decree--decree.

    _Chief of the Ten_.       With this, then, must we
    Return to those who sent us?

    _Doge_.                     You have heard me.

    _Chief of the Ten_. With all due reverence we retire.
                                            [_Exeunt the Deputation, etc._

                           _Enter an Attendant_.

    _Att._                                                My Lord,
    The noble dame Marina craves an audience.

    _Doge_. My time is hers.

                             _Enter_ MARINA.

    _Mar._                    My Lord, if I intrude--
    Perhaps you fain would be alone?

    _Doge_.                          Alone!
    Alone, come all the world around me, I
    Am now and evermore. But we will bear it.

    _Mar._ We will, and for the sake of those who are,
    Endeavour----Oh, my husband!

    _Doge_.                      Give it way:                           70
    I cannot comfort thee.

    _Mar._                  He might have lived,
    So formed for gentle privacy of life,
    So loving, so beloved; the native of
    Another land, and who so blest and blessing
    As my poor Foscari? Nothing was wanting
    Unto his happiness and mine save not
    To be Venetian.

    _Doge_.          Or a Prince's son.

    _Mar._ Yes; all things which conduce to other men's
    Imperfect happiness or high ambition,
    By some strange destiny, to him proved deadly.                      80
    The Country and the People whom he loved,
    The Prince of whom he was the elder born,
    And----

    _Doge_.   Soon may be a Prince no longer.

    _Mar._                                    How?

    _Doge_. They have taken my son from me, and now aim
    At my too long worn diadem and ring.
    Let them resume the gewgaws!

    _Mar._                       Oh, the tyrants!
    In such an hour too!

    _Doge_.              'Tis the fittest time;
    An hour ago I should have felt it.

    _Mar._                             And
    Will you not now resent it?--Oh, for vengeance!
    But he, who, had he been enough protected,                          90
    Might have repaid protection in this moment,
    Cannot assist his father.

    _Doge_.                   Nor should do so
    Against his Country, had he a thousand lives
    Instead of that----

    _Mar._            They tortured from him. This
    May be pure patriotism. I am a woman:
    To me my husband and my children were
    Country and home. I loved _him_--how I loved him!
    I have seen him pass through such an ordeal as
    The old martyrs would have shrunk from: he is gone,
    And I, who would have given my blood for him,                      100
    Have nought to give but tears! But could I compass
    The retribution of his wrongs!--Well, well!
    I have sons, who shall be men.

    _Doge_.                       Your grief distracts you.

    _Mar._ I thought I could have borne it, when I saw him
    Bowed down by such oppression; yes, I thought
    That I would rather look upon his corse
    Than his prolonged captivity:--I am punished
    For that thought now. Would I were in his grave!

    _Doge_. I must look on him once more.

    _Mar._                                 Come with me!

    _Doge_. Is he----

    _Mar._            Our bridal bed is now his bier,                  110

    _Doge_. And he is in his shroud!

    _Mar._                           Come, come, old man!
                                          [_Exeunt the_ DOGE _and_ MARINA.

                    _Enter_ BARBARIGO _and_ LOREDANO.

    _Bar._ (_to an Attendant_). Where is the Doge?

    _Att._                                    This instant retired hence,
    With the illustrious lady his son's widow.

    _Lor._ Where?

    _Att._        To the chamber where the body lies.

    _Bar._ Let us return, then.

    _Lor._                      You forget, you cannot.
    We have the implicit order of the Giunta
    To await their coming here, and join them in
    Their office: they'll be here soon after us.

    _Bar._ And will they press their answer on the Doge?

    _Lor._ 'Twas his own wish that all should be done promptly.        120
    He answered quickly, and must so be answered;
    His dignity is looked to, his estate
    Cared for--what would he more?

    _Bar._                         Die in his robes:
    He could not have lived long; but I have done
    My best to save his honours, and opposed
    This proposition to the last, though vainly.
    Why would the general vote compel me hither?

    _Lor._ 'Twas fit that some one of such different thoughts
    From ours should be a witness, lest false tongues
    Should whisper that a harsh majority                               130
    Dreaded to have its acts beheld by others.

    _Bar._ And not less, I must needs think, for the sake
    Of humbling me for my vain opposition.
    You are ingenious, Loredano, in
    Your modes of vengeance, nay, poetical,
    A very Ovid in the art of _hating_;
    'Tis thus (although a secondary object,
    Yet hate has microscopic eyes), to you
    I owe, by way of foil to the more zealous,
    This undesired association in                                      140
    Your Giunta's duties.

    _Lor._                How!--_my_ Giunta!

    _Bar._                                 _Yours!_
    They speak your language, watch your nod, approve
    Your plans, and do your work. Are they not _yours?_

    _Lor._ You talk unwarily. 'Twere best they hear not
    This from you.

    _Bar._          Oh! they'll hear as much one day
    From louder tongues than mine; they have gone beyond
    Even their exorbitance of power: and when
    This happens in the most contemned and abject
    States, stung humanity will rise to check it.

    _Lor._ You talk but idly.

    _Bar._                   That remains for proof.                   150
    Here come our colleagues.

                    _Enter the Deputation as before_.

    _Chief of the Ten_.      Is the Duke aware
    We seek his presence?

    _Att._               He shall be informed.
                                                        [_Exit Attendant_.

    _Bar._ The Duke is with his son.

    _Chief of the Ten_.                  If it be so,
    We will remit him till the rites are over.
    Let us return. 'Tis time enough to-morrow.

    _Lor._ (_aside to Bar_.) Now the rich man's hell-fire upon your tongue,
    Unquenched, unquenchable! I'll have it torn
    From its vile babbling roots, till you shall utter
    Nothing but sobs through blood, for this! Sage Signors,
    I pray ye be not hasty.                        [_Aloud to the others_.

    _Bar._                  But be human!                              160

    _Lor._ See, the Duke comes!

                            _Enter the_ DOGE.

    _Doge_.                     I have obeyed your summons.

    _Chief of the Ten_. We come once more to urge our past request.

    _Doge_. And I to answer.

    _Chief of the Ten_.       What?

    _Doge_.                        My only answer.
    You have heard it.

    _Chief of the Ten_. Hear _you_ then the last decree,
    Definitive and absolute!

    _Doge_.                 To the point--
    To the point! I know of old the forms of office,
    And gentle preludes to strong acts.--Go on!

    _Chief of the Ten_. You are no longer Doge; you are released
    From your imperial oath as Sovereign;
    Your ducal robes must be put off; but for                          170
    Your services, the State allots the appanage
    Already mentioned in our former congress.
    Three days are left you to remove from hence,
    Under the penalty to see confiscated
    All your own private fortune.

    _Doge_.                      That last clause,
    I am proud to say, would not enrich the treasury.

    _Chief of the Ten_. Your answer, Duke!

    _Lor._                                 Your answer, Francis Foscari!

    _Doge_. If I could have foreseen that my old age
    Was prejudicial to the State, the Chief
    Of the Republic never would have shown                             180
    Himself so far ungrateful, as to place
    His own high dignity before his Country;
    But this _life_ having been so many years
    _Not_ useless to that Country, I would fain
    Have consecrated my last moments to her.
    But the decree being rendered, I obey.[bt][78]

    _Chief of the Ten_. If you would have the three days named extended,
    We willingly will lengthen them to eight,
    As sign of our esteem.

    _Doge_.                Not eight hours, Signor,
    Not even eight minutes--there's the ducal ring,                    190
                                           [_Taking off his ring and cap_.
    And there the ducal diadem! And so
    The Adriatic's free to wed another.

    _Chief of the Ten_. Yet go not forth so quickly.

    _Doge_.                                        I am old, sir,
    And even to move but slowly must begin
    To move betimes. Methinks I see amongst you
    A face I know not.--Senator! your name,
    You, by your garb, Chief of the Forty!

    _Mem._                                Signor,
    I am the son of Marco Memmo.

    _Doge_.                      Ah!
    Your father was my friend.--But _sons_ and _fathers!_--
    What, ho! my servants there!

    _Atten._                     My Prince!

    _Doge_.                                No Prince--                 200
    There are the princes of the Prince!
                                       [_Pointing to the Ten's Deputation_
                                        --Prepare
    To part from hence upon the instant.

    _Chief of the Ten_.                  Why
    So rashly? 'twill give scandal.

    _Doge_ (_to the Ten_).         Answer that;
    It is your province.
                                                       [_To the Servants_.
                        --Sirs, bestir yourselves:
    There is one burthen which I beg you bear
    With care, although 'tis past all farther harm--
    But I will look to that myself.

    _Bar._                         He means
    The body of his son.

    _Doge_.              And call Marina,
    My daughter!

                             _Enter_ MARINA.

    _Doge_.      Get thee ready, we must mourn
    Elsewhere.

    _Mar._     And everywhere.

    _Doge_.                  True; but in freedom,                     210
    Without these jealous spies upon the great.
    Signers, you may depart: what would you more?
    We are going; do you fear that we shall bear
    The palace with us? Its _old_ walls, ten times
    As _old_ as I am, and I'm very old,
    Have served you, so have I, and I and they
    Could tell a tale; but I invoke them not
    To fall upon you! else they would, as erst
    The pillars of stone Dagon's temple on
    The Israelite and his Philistine foes.                             220
    Such power I do believe there might exist
    In such a curse as mine, provoked by such
    As you; but I curse not. Adieu, good Signers!
    May the next Duke be better than the present!

    _Lor._ The _present_ Duke is Paschal Malipiero.

    _Doge_. Not till I pass the threshold of these doors.

    _Lor._ Saint Mark's great bell is soon about to toll
    For his inauguration.

    _Doge_.               Earth and Heaven!
    Ye will reverberate this peal; and I
    Live to hear this!--the first Doge who e'er heard                  230
    Such sound for his successor: happier he,
    My attainted predecessor, stern Faliero--
    This insult at the least was spared him.

    _Lor._                                   What!
    Do you regret a traitor?

    _Doge_.                   No--I merely
    Envy the dead.

    _Chief of the Ten_.   My Lord, if you indeed
    Are bent upon this rash abandonment
    Of the State's palace, at the least retire
    By the private staircase, which conducts you towards
    The landing-place of the canal.

    _Doge_.                         No. I
    Will now descend the stairs by which I mounted                     240
    To sovereignty--the Giants' Stairs, on whose
    Broad eminence I was invested Duke.
    My services have called me up those steps,
    The malice of my foes will drive me down them.[79]
    _There_ five and thirty years ago was I
    Installed, and traversed these same halls, from which
    I never thought to be divorced except
    A corse--a corse, it might be, fighting for them--
    But not pushed hence by fellow-citizens.
    But come; my son and I will go together--                          250
    He to his grave, and I to pray for mine.

    _Chief of the Ten_. What! thus in public?

    _Doge_.                                  I was publicly
    Elected, and so will I be deposed.
    Marina! art thou willing?

    _Mar._                   Here's my arm!

    _Doge_. And here my _staff_: thus propped will I go forth.

    _Chief of the Ten_. It must not be--the people will perceive it.

    _Doge_. The people,--There's no people, you well know it,
    Else you dare not deal thus by them or me.
    There is a _populace_, perhaps, whose looks
    May shame you; but they dare not groan nor curse you,              260
    Save with their hearts and eyes.

    _Chief of the Ten_.               You speak in passion,
    Else----

    _Doge_. You have reason. I have spoken much
    More than my wont: it is a foible which
    Was not of mine, but more excuses you,
    Inasmuch as it shows, that I approach
    A dotage which may justify this deed
    Of yours, although the law does not, nor will.
    Farewell, sirs!

    _Bar._         You shall not depart without
    An escort fitting past and present rank.
    We will accompany, with due respect,                               270
    The Doge unto his private palace. Say!
    My brethren, will we not?

    _Different voices_.       Aye!--Aye!

    _Doge_.                              You shall not
    Stir--in my train, at least. I entered here
    As Sovereign--I go out as citizen
    By the same portals, but as citizen.
    All these vain ceremonies are base insults,
    Which only ulcerate the heart the more,
    Applying poisons there as antidotes.
    Pomp is for Princes--I am none!--That's false,
    I _am_, but only to these gates.--Ah!

    _Lor._                               Hark!                         280
                                    [_The great bell of St. Mark's tolls_.

    _Bar._ The bell!

    _Chief of the Ten_. St. Mark's, which tolls for the election
    Of Malipiero.

    _Doge_.       Well I recognise
    The sound! I heard it once, but once before,
    And that is five and thirty years ago;
    Even _then_ I _was not young_.

    _Bar._                      Sit down, my Lord!
    You tremble.

    _Doge_.      'Tis the knell of my poor boy!
    My heart aches bitterly.

    _Bar._                   I pray you sit.

    _Doge_. No; my seat here has been a throne till now.
    Marina! let us go.

    _Mar._             Most readily.

    _Doge_. (_walks a few steps, then stops_).
    I feel athirst--will no one bring me here                          290
    A cup of water?

    _Bar._         I----

    _Mar._              And I----

    _Lor._                       And I----
                     [_The Doge takes a goblet from the hand of_ LOREDANO.

    _Doge_. I take _yours_, Loredano, from the hand
    Most fit for such an hour as this.[bu]

    _Lor._                            Why so?

    _Doge_. 'Tis said that our Venetian crystal has
    Such pure antipathy to poisons as
    To burst, if aught of venom touches it.
    You bore this goblet, and it is not broken.

    _Lor._ Well, sir!

    _Doge_.           Then it is false, or you are true.
    For my own part, I credit neither; 'tis
    An idle legend.

    _Mar._          You talk wildly, and                               300
    Had better now be seated, nor as yet
    Depart. Ah! now you look as looked my husband!

    _Bar._ He sinks!--support him!--quick--a chair--support him!

    _Doge_. The bell tolls on!--let's hence--my brain's on fire!

    _Bar._ I do beseech you, lean upon us!

    _Doge_.                                No!
    A Sovereign should die standing. My poor boy!
    Off with your arms!--_That bell!_[80]
                                        [_The_ DOGE _drops down and dies_.

    _Mar._ My God! My God!

    _Bar._ (_to Lor._). Behold! your work's completed!

    _Chief of the Ten_.                              Is there then
    No aid? Call in assistance!

    _Att._                     'Tis all over.

    _Chief of the Ten_. If it be so, at least his obsequies            310
    Shall be such as befits his name and nation,
    His rank and his devotion to the duties
    Of the realm, while his age permitted him
    To do himself and them full justice. Brethren,
    Say, shall it not be so?

    _Bar._                   He has not had
    The misery to die a subject where[bv]
    He reigned: then let his funeral rites be princely.[81]

    _Chief of the Ten_. We are agreed, then?

    _All, except Lor., answer,_              Yes.

    _Chief of the Ten_. Heaven's peace be with him!

    _Mar._ Signers, your pardon: this is mockery.                      320
    Juggle no more with that poor remnant, which,
    A moment since, while yet it had a soul,
    (A soul by whom you have increased your Empire,
    And made your power as proud as was his glory),
    You banished from his palace and tore down
    From his high place, with such relentless coldness;
    And now, when he can neither know these honours,
    Nor would accept them if he could, you, Signors,
    Purpose, with idle and superfluous pomp,
    To make a pageant over what you trampled.                          330
    A princely funeral will be your reproach,
    And not his honour.

    _Chief of the Ten_. Lady, we revoke not
    Our purposes so readily.

    _Mar._                  I know it,
    As far as touches torturing the living.
    I thought the dead had been beyond even _you_,
    Though (some, no doubt) consigned to powers which may
    Resemble that you exercise on earth.
    Leave him to me; you would have done so for
    His dregs of life, which you have kindly shortened:
    It is my last of duties, and may prove                             340
    A dreary comfort in my desolation.[bw]
    Grief is fantastical, and loves the dead,
    And the apparel of the grave.

    _Chief of the Ten_.          Do you
    Pretend still to this office?

    _Mar._                        I do, Signor.
    Though his possessions have been all consumed
    In the State's service, I have still my dowry,
    Which shall be consecrated to his rites,
    And those of----                          [_She stops with agitation_.

    _Chief of the Ten_. Best retain it for your children.

    _Mar._ Aye, they are fatherless, I thank you.

    _Chief of the Ten_.                           We
    Cannot comply with your request. His relics                        350
    Shall be exposed with wonted pomp, and followed
    Unto their home by the new Doge, not clad
    As _Doge_, but simply as a senator.

    _Mar._ I have heard of murderers, who have interred
    Their victims; but ne'er heard, until this hour,
    Of so much splendour in hypocrisy
    O'er those they slew.[82] I've heard of widows' tears--
    Alas! I have shed some--always thanks to you!
    I've heard of _heirs_ in sables--you have left none
    To the deceased, so you would act the part                         360
    Of such. Well, sirs, your will be done! as one day,
    I trust, Heaven's will be done too![bx]

    _Chief of the Ten_.                 Know you, Lady,
    To whom ye speak, and perils of such speech?

    _Mar._ I know the former better than yourselves;
    The latter--like yourselves; and can face both.
    Wish you more funerals?

    _Bar._                 Heed not her rash words;
    Her circumstances must excuse her bearing.

    _Chief of the Ten_. We will not note them down.

    _Bar._ (_turning to Lor., who is writing upon his tablets_).
                                                  What art thou writing,
    With such an earnest brow, upon thy tablets?

    _Lor._ (_pointing to the Doge's body_). That _he_ has paid me![83]

    _Chief of the Ten_. What debt did he owe you?                      370

    _Lor._ A long and just one; Nature's debt and _mine_.[84]
                                                      [_Curtain falls_[85]

[at] ----_too soon repeated_.--[MS. erased.]

[37] {121}[It is a moot point whether Jacopo Foscari was placed on the
rack on the occasion of his third trial. The original document of the X.
(July 23, 1456) runs thus: "Si videtur vobis per ea quae dicta et lecta
sunt, quod _procedatur_ contra Ser Jacobum Foscari;" and it is argued
(see F. Berlan, _I due Foscari, etc._, 1852, p. 57), (1) that the word
_procedatur_ is not a euphemism for "tortured," but should be rendered
"judgment be given against;" (2) that if the X had decreed torture,
torture would have been expressly enjoined; and (3) that as the decrees
of the Council were not divulged, there was no motive for ambiguity. S.
Romanin (_Storia Documentata, etc._, 1853, iv. 284) and R. Senger (_Die
beiden Foscari_, 1878, p. 116) take the same view. On the other hand,
Miss A. Wiel (_Two Doges of Venice_, 1891, p. 107) points out that,
according to the _Dolfin Cronaca_, which Berlan did not consult, Jacopo
was in a "mutilated" condition when the trial was over, and he was
permitted to take a last farewell of his wife and children in
Torricella. Goethe (_Conversations_, 1874, pp. 264, 265) did not share
Eckermann's astonishment that Byron "could dwell so long on this
torturing subject." "He was always a self-tormentor, and hence such
subjects were his darling theme."]

[38] {122}[It is extremely improbable that Francesco Foscari was present
in person at the third or two preceding trials of his son. As may be
gathered from the _parte_ of the Council of Ten relating to the first
trial, there was a law which prescribed the contrary: "In ipsius Domini
Ducis praesentia de rebus ad ipsum, vel ad filios suos tangentibus non
tractetur, loquatur vel consulatur, sicut non potest (_fieri_) quando
tractatur de rebus tangentibus ad attinentes Domini Ducis." The fact
that "Nos Franciscus Foscari," etc., stood at the commencement of the
decree of exile may have given rise to the tradition that the Doge, like
a Roman father, tried and condemned his son. (See Berlan's _I due
Foscari_, p. 13.)]

[39] {123}[Pietro Loredano, admiral of the Venetian fleet, died November
11, 1438. His death was sudden and suspicious, for he was taken with
violent pains and spasms after presiding at a banquet in honour of his
victories over the Milanese; and, when his illness ended fatally, it was
remembered that the Doge had publicly declared that so long as the
admiral lived he would never be _de facto_ Prince of the Republic.
Jacopo Loredano chose to put his own interpretation on this outburst of
impatience, and inscribed on his father's monument in the Church of the
Monastery of Sant' Elena, in the Isola della Santa Lena, the words, "Per
insidias hostium veneno sublatus." (See _Ecclesiae Venetae_, by Flaminio
Cornaro, 1749, ix. 193, 194; see, too, Cicogna's _Inscrizioni
Veneziane_, 1830, iii. 381.)

Not long afterwards Marco Loredano, the admiral's brother, met with a
somewhat similar fate. He had been despatched by the X. to Legnano, to
investigate the conduct of Andrea Donate, the Doge's brother-in-law, who
was suspected of having embezzled the public moneys. His report was
unfavourable to Donato, and, shortly after, he too fell sick and died.
It is most improbable that the Doge was directly or indirectly
responsible for the death of either brother; but there was an hereditary
feud, and the libellous epitaph was a move in the game.]

valuable chiefly for the light it throws upon the internal history of

Ten is all-powerful; it even usurps functions which do not belong to it
by the constitution. The air is charged with plots, suspicion,
assassination, denunciation, spies,--all the paraphernalia which went to
confirm the popular legend as to the terrible nature of the

According to another footnote (_ibid_., p. 90), "this story (_Foscari_)

published anonymously in 1822. According to the announcement of a
corrected and enlarged edition, which appeared in the _Morning
Chronicle_, April 11, 1823, "a few copies of this poem were printed off
the winter before last, while the author was abroad."]

[45] {133}[Jacopo's plea, that the letter to the Duke of Milan was
written for the express purpose of being recalled to Venice, is
inadmissible for more reasons than one. In the first place, if on
suspicion of a letter written but never sent, the Ten had thought fit to
recall him, it by no means followed that they would have granted him an
interview with his wife and family; and, secondly, the fact that there
were letters in cypher found in his possession, and that a direct
invitation to the Sultan to rescue him by force was among the impounded
documents ("Quod requirebat dictum Teucrum ut mitteret ex galeis suis ad
accipiendum et levandum eum de dicto loco"), proves that the appeal to
the Duke of Milan was _bona fide_, and not a mere act of desperation.

[62] {158} In Lady Morgan's fearless and excellent work upon Italy, I
perceive the expression of "Rome of the Ocean" applied to Venice. The
same phrase occurs in the "Two Foscari." My publisher can vouch for me,
that the tragedy was written and sent to England some time before I had
seen Lady Morgan's work, which I only received on the 16th of August. I
hasten, however, to notice the coincidence, and to yield the originality
of the phrase to her who first placed it before the public.

[Byron calls Lady Morgan's _Italy_ "fearless" on account of her
strictures on the behaviour of Great Britain to Genoa in 1814. "England
personally stood pledged to Genoa.... When the British officers rode
into their gates bearing the white flag consecrated by the holy word of
'_independence_,' the people ... '_kissed their garments_.'... Every
heart was open.... Lord William Bentinck's flag of '_Independenza_' was
taken down from the steeples and high places at sunrise; before noon the
arms of Sardinia blazoned in their stead; and yet the Genoese did not
rise _en masse_ and massacre the English" (_Italy_, 1821, i. 245, 246).
The passage which Byron feared might be quoted to his disparagement runs
as follows: "As the bark glides on, as the shore recedes, and the city
of waves, the Rome of the ocean, rises on the horizon, the spirits
rally; ... and as the spires and cupolas of Venice come forth in the
lustre of the mid-day sun, and its palaces, half-veiled in the aerial
tints of distance, gradually assume their superb proportions, then the
dream of many a youthful vigil is realized" (_ibid_., ii. 449).]

[64] {159} The Calenture.--[From the Spanish _Calentura_, a fever
peculiar to sailors within the tropics--

    "So, by a calenture misled,
        The mariner with rapture sees,
    On the smooth ocean's azure bed,
        Enamelled fields and verdant trees:
    With eager haste he longs to rove
       In that fantastic scene, and thinks
    It must be some enchanted grove;
       And in he leaps, and down he sinks."

[65] Alluding to the Swiss air and its effects.--[The _Ranz des Vaches_,
played upon the bag-pipe by the young cowkeepers on the mountains:--"An
air," says Rousseau, "so dear to the Swiss, that it was forbidden, under
the pain of death, to play it to the troops, as it immediately drew
tears from them, and made those who heard it desert, or die of what is
called _la maladie du pais_, so ardent a desire did it excite to return
to their country. It is in vain to seek in this air for energetic
accents capable of producing such astonishing effects, for which
strangers are unable to account from the music, which is in itself
uncouth and wild. But it is from habit, recollections, and a thousand
circumstances, retraced in this tune by those natives who hear it, and
reminding them of their country, former pleasures of their youth, and
all their ways of living, which occasion a bitter reflection at having
lost them." Compare Byron's Swiss "Journal" for September 19, 1816,

[70] {170}[A touching incident is told concerning an interview between
the Doge and Jacopo Memmo, head of the Forty. The Doge had just learnt
(October 21, 1457) the decision of the Ten with regard to his
abdication, and noticed that Memmo watched him attentively. "Foscari
called to him, and, touching his hand, asked him whose son he was. He
answered, 'I am the son of Messer Marin Memmo.'--' He is my dear
friend,' said the Doge; 'tell him from me that it would be pleasing to
me if he would come and see me, so that we might go at our leisure in
our boats to visit the monasteries'" (_The Two Doges_, by A. Weil, 1891,

ultimi abbraciamenti, Jacopo piu che mai sentendo il dolore di quel
distacco, diceva: _Padre ve priego, procure per mi, che ritorni a casa
mia_. E messer lo doxe: _Jacomo va e obbedisci quel che vuol la terra e
non cerear piu oltre_. Ma, uscito l'infelice figlio dalla stanza, piu
non resistendo alla piena degli affetti, si getto piangendo sopra una
sedia e lamentando diceva: _O pieta grande_!"]

sent back to exile in Crete, and did not die till February, 1457. His
death at Venice, immediately after his sentence, is contrived for the
sake of observing "the unities."]

[75] {178}[It is to be noted that the "Giunta" was demanded by Loredano

nobles to the original Ten would add to the chance of opposition on the
part of the supporters and champions of the Doge (see _The Two Doges_,

[77] {183}[By the terms of the "parte," or act of deposition drawn up by
the Ten, October 21, 1457, the time granted for deliberation was "till
the third hour of the following day." This limitation as to time was
designed to prevent the Doge from summoning the Grand Council, "to whom
alone belonged the right of releasing him from the dukedom." (_The Two

di notte,' dressed in a golden mantle, with the ducal bonnet on his
head, golden spurs on his feet, ... the gold sword by his side." But
Foscari's wife, Marina (or Maria) Nani, opposed. "She declined to give
up the body, which she had caused to be dressed in plain clothes, and
she maintained that no one but herself should provide for the funeral
expenses, even should she have to give up her dower." It is needless to
add that her protest was unavailing, and that the decree of the Ten was
carried into effect.--_The Two Doges_, 1891, pp. 129, 130.]

the kind in the Doge Marco Barbarigo: he was succeeded by his brother
Agostino Barbarigo, whose chief merit is here mentioned.--"Le doge,
blesse de trouver constamment un contradicteur et un censeur si amer

vous faites tout votre possible pour hater ma mort; vous vous flattez de

qu'on lui donna. C'etait un merite don't on aimait a tenir compte;

According to Pietro Giustiniani (_Storia_, lib. viii.), Jacopo Loredano
was at pains to announce the decree of the Ten to the Doge in courteous

duty to do. Romanin points out that this version of the interview is
inconsistent with the famous "_L'hapagata_."--_Storia, etc._, iv. 290,

                         INTRODUCTION TO _CAIN_.


Cain was begun at Ravenna, July 16, and finished September 9, 1821
(_vide_ MS. M.). Six months before, when he was at work on the first act
of _Sardanapalus_, Byron had "pondered" _Cain_, but it was not till
_Sardanapalus_ and a second historical play, _The Two Foscari_, had been
written, copied out, and sent to England, that he indulged his genius
with a third drama--on "a metaphysical subject, something in the style
of _Manfred_" (_Letters_, 1901, v. 189).

Goethe's comment on reading and reviewing _Cain_ was that he should be
surprised if Byron did not pursue the treatment of such "biblical
subjects," as the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah (_Conversations,
etc._, 1879, p. 62); and, many years after, he told Crabb Robinson
(_Diary_, 1869, ii. 435) that Byron should have lived "to execute his
vocation ... to dramatize the Old Testament." He was better equipped for
such a task than might have been imagined. A Scottish schoolboy, "from a
child he had known the Scriptures," and, as his _Hebrew Melodies_
testify, he was not unwilling to turn to the Bible as a source of poetic
inspiration. Moreover, he was born with the religious temperament.
Questions "of Providence, foreknowledge, will and fate," exercised his
curiosity because they appealed to his imagination and moved his spirit.
He was eager to plunge into controversy with friends and advisers who
challenged or rebuked him, Hodgson, for instance, or Dallas; and he
responded with remarkable amenity to the strictures and exhortations of
such orthodox professors as Mr. Sheppard and Dr. Kennedy. He was, no
doubt, from first to last a _heretic_, impatient, not to say
contemptuous, of authority, but he was by no means indifferent to
religion altogether. To "argue about it and about" was a necessity, if
not an agreeable relief, to his intellectual energies. It would appear
from the Ravenna diary (January 28, 1821, _Letters_, 1901, v. 190,191),
that the conception of Lucifer was working in his brain before the
"tragedy of Cain" was actually begun. He had been recording a "thought"
which had come to him, that "at the very height of human desire and
pleasure, a certain sense of doubt and sorrow"--an _amari aliquid_ which
links the future to the past, and so blots out the present--"mingles
with our bliss," making it of none effect, and, by way of moral or
corollary to his soliloquy, he adds three lines of verse headed,
"Thought for a speech of Lucifer in the Tragedy of _Cain_"--

    "Were Death an _Evil_, would _I_ let thee live?
    Fool! live as I live--as thy father lives,
    And thy son's sons shall live for evermore."

In these three lines, which were not inserted in the play, and in the
preceding "thought," we have the key-note to _Cain_. "Man walketh in a
vain shadow"--a shadow which he can never overtake, the shadow of an
eternally postponed fruition. With a being capable of infinite
satisfaction, he is doomed to realize failure in attainment. In all that
is best and most enjoyable, "the rapturous moment and the placid hour,"
there is a foretaste of "Death the Unknown"! The tragedy of _Manfred_
lies in remorse for the inevitable past; the tragedy of _Cain_, in
revolt against the limitations of the inexorable present.

The investigation of the "sources" of _Cain_ does not lead to any very
definite conclusion (see _Lord Byron's Cain und Seine Quellen_, von
Alfred Schaffner, 1880). He was pleased to call his play "a Mystery,"
and, in his Preface (_vide post_, p. 207), Byron alludes to the Old
Mysteries as "those very profane productions, whether in English,
French, Italian, or Spanish." The first reprint of the _Chester Plays_
was published by the Roxburghe Club in 1818, but Byron's knowledge of
Mystery Plays was probably derived from _Dodsley's Plays_ (ed. 1780, l.,
xxxiii.-xlii.), or from John Stevens's Continuation of Dugdale's
_Monasticon_ (_vide post_, p. 207), or possibly, as Herr Schaffner
suggests, from Warton's _History of English Poetry_, ed. 1871, ii.
222-230. He may, too, have witnessed some belated _Rappresentazione_ of
the Creation and Fall at Ravenna, or in one of the remoter towns or
villages of Italy. There is a superficial resemblance between the
treatment of the actual encounter of Cain and Abel, and the conventional
rendering of the same incident in the _Ludus Coventriae_, and in the
_Mistere du Viel Testament_; but it is unlikely that he had closely
studied any one Mystery Play at first hand. On the other hand, his
recollections of Gessner's _Death of Abel_ which "he had never read
since he was eight years old," were clearer than he imagined. Not only
in such minor matters as the destruction of Cain's altar by a whirlwind,
and the substitution of the Angel of the Lord for the _Deus_ of the
Mysteries, but in the Teutonic domesticities of Cain and Adah, and the
evangelical piety of Adam and Abel, there is a reflection, if not an
imitation, of the German idyll (see Gessner's _Death of Abel_, ed. 1797,
pp. 80, 102).

Of his indebtedness to Milton he makes no formal acknowledgment, but he
was not ashamed to shelter himself behind Milton's shield when he was
attacked on the score of blasphemy and profanity. "If _Cain_ be
blasphemous, _Paradise Lost_ is blasphemous" (letter to Murray, Pisa,
February 8, 1822), was, he would fain believe, a conclusive answer to
his accusers. But apart from verbal parallels or coincidences, there is
a genuine affinity between Byron's Lucifer and Milton's Satan. Lucifer,
like Satan, is "not less than Archangel ruined," a repulsed but
"unvanquished Titan," marred by a demonic sorrow, a confessor though a
rival of Omnipotence. He is a majestic and, as a rule, a serious and
solemn spirit, who compels the admiration and possibly the sympathy of
the reader. There is, however, another strain in his ghostly attributes,
which betrays a more recent consanguinity: now and again he gives token
that he is of the lineage of Mephistopheles. He is sometimes, though
rarely, a mocking as well as a rebellious spirit, and occasionally
indulges in a grim _persiflage_ beneath the dignity if not the capacity
of Satan. It is needless to add that Lucifer has a most lifelike
personality of his own. The conception of the spirit of evil justifying
an eternal antagonism to the Creator from the standpoint of a superior
morality, may, perhaps, be traced to a Manichean source, but it has been
touched with a new emotion. Milton's devil is an abstraction of infernal
pride--

          "Sole Positive of Night!
            Antipathist of Light!
    Fate's only essence! primal scorpion rod--
    The one permitted opposite of God!"

Goethe's devil is an abstraction of scorn. He "maketh a mock" alike of
good and evil! But Byron's devil is a spirit, yet a mortal too--the
traducer, because he has suffered for his sins; the deceiver, because he
is self-deceived; the hoper against hope that there is a ransom for the
soul in perfect self-will and not in perfect self-sacrifice. Byron did
not uphold Lucifer, but he "had passed that way," and could imagine a
spiritual warfare not only against the _Deus_ of the Mysteries or of the
Book of Genesis, but against what he believed and acknowledged to be
the Author and Principle of good.

_Autres temps, autres moeurs!_ It is all but impossible for the modern
reader to appreciate the audacity of _Cain_, or to realize the alarm and
indignation which it aroused by its appearance. Byron knew that he was
raising a tempest, and pleads, in his Preface, "that with regard to the
language of Lucifer, it was difficult for me to make him talk like a
clergyman," and again and again he assures his correspondents (_e.g._ to
Murray, November 23, 1821, "_Cain_ is nothing more than a drama;" to
Moore, March 4, 1822, "With respect to Religion, can I never convince
you that _I_ have no such opinions as the characters in that drama,
which seems to have frightened everybody?" _Letters_, 1901, v. 469; vi.
30) that it is Lucifer and not Byron who puts such awkward questions
with regard to the "politics of paradise" and the origin of evil. Nobody
seems to have believed him. It was taken for granted that Lucifer was
the mouthpiece of Byron, that the author of _Don Juan_ was not "on the
side of the angels."

Little need be said of the "literature," the pamphlets and poems which
were evoked by the publication of _Cain: A Mystery_. One of the most
prominent assailants (said to be the Rev. H. J. Todd (1763-1845),
Archdeacon of Cleveland, 1832, author _inter alia_ of _Original Sin_,
_Free Will_, etc., 1818) issued _A Remonstrance to Mr. John Murray,
respecting a Recent Publication_, 1822, signed "Oxoniensis." The sting
of the _Remonstrance_ lay in the exposure of the fact that Byron was
indebted to Bayle's _Dictionary_ for his rabbinical legends, and that he
had derived from the same source his Manichean doctrines of the _Two
Principles, etc._, and other "often-refuted sophisms" with regard to the
origin of evil. Byron does not borrow more than a poet and a gentleman
is at liberty to acquire by way of raw material, but it cannot be denied
that he had read and inwardly digested more than one of Bayle's "most
objectionable articles" (_e.g._ "Adam," "Eve," "Abel," "Manichees,"
"Paulicians," etc.). The _Remonstrance_ was answered in _A Letter to Sir
Walter Scott, etc._, by "Harroviensis." Byron welcomed such a "Defender
of the Faith," and was anxious that Murray should print the letter
together with the poem. But Murray belittled the "defender," and was
upbraided in turn for his slowness of heart (letter to Murray, June 6,
1822, _Letters_, 1901, vi. 76).

Fresh combatants rushed into the fray: "Philo-Milton," with a
_Vindication of the "Paradise Lost" from the charge of exculpating
"Cain: A Mystery_," London, 1822; "Britannicus," with a pamphlet
entitled, _Revolutionary Causes, etc., and A Postscript containing
Strictures on "Cain," etc._, London, 1822, etc.; but their works, which
hardly deserve to be catalogued, have perished with them. Finally, in
1830, a barrister named Harding Grant, author of _Chancery Practice_,
compiled a work (_Lord Byron's "Cain," etc., with Notes_) of more than
four hundred pages, in which he treats "the proceedings and speeches of
Lucifer with the same earnestness as if they were existing and earthly
personages." But it was "a week too late." The "Coryphaeus of the Satanic
School" had passed away, and the tumult had "dwindled to a calm."

_Cain_ "appeared in conjunction with" _Sardanapalus_ and _The Two
Foscari_, December 19, 1821. Last but not least of the three plays, it
had been announced "by a separate advertisement (_Morning Chronicle_,
November 24, 1821), for the purpose of exciting the greater curiosity"
(_Memoirs of the Life, etc._ [by John Watkins], 1822, p. 383), and it
was no sooner published than it was pirated. In the following January,
"_Cain: A Mystery_, by the author of _Don Juan_," was issued by W.
Benbow, at Castle Street, Leicester Square (the notorious "Byron Head,"
which Southey described as "one of those preparatory schools for the
brothel and the gallows, where obscenity, sedition, and blasphemy are
retailed in drams for the vulgar"!).

Murray had paid Byron ?2710 for the three tragedies, and in order to
protect the copyright, he applied, through counsel (Lancelot Shadwell,
afterwards Vice-Chancellor), for an injunction in Chancery to stop the
sale of piratical editions of _Cain_. In delivering judgment (February
12, 1822), the Chancellor, Lord Eldon (see _Courier_, Wednesday,
February 13), replying to Shadwell, drew a comparison between _Cain_ and
_Paradise Lost_, "which he had read from beginning to end during the
course of the last Long Vacation--_solicitae jucunda oblivia vitae_." No
one, he argued, could deny that the object and effects of _Paradise
Lost_ were "not to bring into disrepute," but "to promote reverence for
our religion," and, _per contra_, no one could affirm that it was
impossible to arrive at an opposite conclusion with regard to "the
Preface, the poem, the general tone and manner of _Cain_." It was a
question for a jury. A jury might decide that _Cain_ was blasphemous,
and void of copyright; and as there was a reasonable doubt in his mind
as to the character of the book, and a doubt as to the conclusion at
which a jury would arrive, he was compelled to refuse the injunction.
According to Dr. Smiles (_Memoir of John Murray_, 1891, i. 428), the
decision of a jury was taken, and an injunction eventually granted. If
so, it was ineffectual, for Benbow issued another edition of _Cain_ in
1824 (see Jacob's _Reports_, p. 474, note). See, too, the case of
Murray _v_. Benbow and Another, as reported in the _Examiner_, February
17, 1822; and cases of Wolcot _v_. Walker, Southey _v_. Sherwood, Murray
_v_. Benbow, and Lawrence _v_. Smith [_Quarterly Review_, April, 1822,
vol. xxvii. pp. 120-138].

"_Cain_," said Moore (February 9, 1822), "has made a sensation." Friends
and champions, the press, the public "turned up their thumbs." Gifford
shook his head; Hobhouse "launched out into a most violent invective"
(letter to Murray, November 24, 1821); Jeffrey, in the _Edinburgh_, was
regretful and hortatory; Heber, in the _Quarterly_, was fault-finding
and contemptuous. The "parsons preached at it from Kentish Town to Pisa"
(letter to Moore, February 20, 1822). Even "the very highest authority
in the land," his Majesty King George IV., "expressed his disapprobation
of the blasphemy and licentiousness of Lord Byron's writings"
(_Examiner_, February 17, 1822). Byron himself was forced to admit that
"my Mont Saint Jean seems Cain" (_Don Juan_, Canto XI. stanza lvi. line
2). The many were unanimous in their verdict, but the higher court of
the few reversed the judgment.

Goethe said that "Its beauty is such as we shall not see a second time
in the world" (_Conversations, etc._, 1874, p. 261); Scott, in speaking
of "the very grand and tremendous drama of _Cain_," said that the author
had "matched Milton on his own ground" (letter to Murray, December 4,
1821, _vide post_, p. 206); "_Cain_," wrote Shelley to Gisborne (April
10, 1822), "is apocalyptic; it is a revelation never before communicated
to man."

Uncritical praise, as well as uncritical censure, belongs to the past;
but the play remains, a singular exercise of "poetic energy," a
confession, _ex animo_, of "the burthen of the mystery, ... the heavy
and the weary weight Of all this unintelligible world."

                                   TO

                         SIR WALTER SCOTT, BART.,

                          THIS MYSTERY OF CAIN

                               IS INSCRIBED,

                           BY HIS OBLIGED FRIEND

                                  AND FAITHFUL SERVANT,

                                            THE AUTHOR.[86]




                                 PREFACE


The following scenes are entitled "A Mystery," in conformity with the
ancient title annexed to dramas upon similar subjects, which were styled
"Mysteries, or Moralities."[87] The author has by no means taken the
same liberties with his subject which were common formerly, as may be
seen by any reader curious enough to refer to those very profane
productions, whether in English, French, Italian, or Spanish. The author
has endeavoured to preserve the language adapted to his characters; and
where it is (and this is but rarely) taken from actual _Scripture_, he
has made as little alteration, even of words, as the rhythm would
permit. The reader will recollect that the book of Genesis does not
state that Eve was tempted by a demon, but by "the Serpent[88];" and
that only because he was "the most subtil of all the beasts of the
field." Whatever interpretation the Rabbins and the Fathers may have put
upon this, I take the words as I find them, and reply, with Bishop
Watson[89] upon similar occasions, when the Fathers were quoted to him
as Moderator in the schools of Cambridge, "Behold the Book!"--holding up
the Scripture. It is to be recollected, that my present subject has
nothing to do with the _New Testament_, to which no reference can be
here made without anachronism.[90] With the poems upon similar topics I
have not been recently familiar. Since I was twenty I have never read
Milton; but I had read him so frequently before, that this may make
little difference. Gesner's "Death of Abel" I have never read since I
was eight years of age, at Aberdeen. The general impression of my
recollection is delight; but of the contents I remember only that Cain's
wife was called Mahala, and Abel's Thirza; in the following pages I have
called them "Adah" and "Zillah," the earliest female names which occur
in Genesis. They were those of Lamech's wives: those of Cain and Abel
are not called by their names. Whether, then, a coincidence of subject
may have caused the same in expression, I know nothing, and care as
little. [I[91] am prepared to be accused of Manicheism,[92] or some
other hard name ending in _ism_, which makes a formidable figure and
awful sound in the eyes and ears of those who would be as much puzzled
to explain the terms so bandied about, as the liberal and pious
indulgers in such epithets. Against such I can defend myself, or, if
necessary, I can attack in turn. "Claw for claw, as Conan said to Satan
and the deevil take the shortest nails" (Waverley).[93]]

The reader will please to bear in mind (what few choose to recollect),
that there is no allusion to a future state in any of the books of
Moses, nor indeed in the Old Testament. For a reason for this
extraordinary omission he may consult Warburton's "Divine
Legation;"[94] whether satisfactory or not, no better has yet been
assigned. I have therefore supposed it new to Cain, without, I hope, any
perversion of Holy Writ.

With regard to the language of Lucifer, it was difficult for me to make
him talk like a clergyman upon the same subjects; but I have done what I
could to restrain him within the bounds of spiritual politeness. If he
disclaims having tempted Eve in the shape of the Serpent, it is only
because the book of Genesis has not the most distant allusion to
anything of the kind, but merely to the Serpent in his serpentine
capacity.

_Note_.--The reader will perceive that the author has partly adopted in
this poem the notion of Cuvier,[95] that the world had been destroyed
several times before the creation of man. This speculation, derived from
the different strata and the bones of enormous and unknown animals found
in them, is not contrary to the Mosaic account, but rather confirms it;
as no human bones have yet been discovered in those strata, although
those of many known animals are found near the remains of the unknown.
The assertion of Lucifer, that the pre-Adamite world was also peopled by
rational beings much more intelligent than man, and proportionably
powerful to the mammoth, etc., etc., is, of course, a poetical fiction
to help him to make out his case.

I ought to add, that there is a "tramelogedia" of Alfieri, called
"Abele."[96] I have never read that, nor any other of the posthumous
works of the writer, except his Life.

                             CAIN: A MYSTERY.




                                  ACT I.


          SCENE I.--_The Land without Paradise.--Time, Sunrise_.


       ADAM, EVE, CAIN, ABEL, ADAH, ZILLAH, _offering a Sacrifice_.

    _Adam_. God, the Eternal! Infinite! All-wise!--
    Who out of darkness on the deep didst make
    Light on the waters with a word--All Hail!
    Jehovah! with returning light--All Hail!

    _Eve_. God! who didst name the day, and separate
    Morning from night, till then divided never--
    Who didst divide the wave from wave, and call
    Part of thy work the firmament--All Hail!

    _Abel_. God! who didst call the elements into
    Earth, ocean, air and fire--and with the day                        10
    And night, and worlds which these illuminate,
    Or shadow, madest beings to enjoy them,
    And love both them and thee--All Hail! All Hail!

    _Adah_. God! the Eternal parent of all things!
    Who didst create these best and beauteous beings,
    To be beloved, more than all, save thee--
    Let me love thee and them:--All Hail! All Hail!

    _Zillah_. Oh, God! who loving, making, blessing all,
    Yet didst permit the Serpent to creep in,
    And drive my father forth from Paradise,                            20
    Keep us from further evil:--Hail! All Hail!

    _Adam_. Son Cain! my first-born--wherefore art thou silent?

    _Cain_. Why should I speak?

    _Adam_.                     To pray.

    _Cain_.                             Have ye not prayed?

    _Adam_. We have, most fervently.

    _Cain_.                           And loudly: I
    Have heard you.

    _Adam_.         So will God, I trust.

    _Abel_.                              Amen!

    _Adam_. But thou my eldest born? art silent still?

    _Cain_. 'Tis better I should be so.

    _Adam_.                              Wherefore so?

    _Cain_. I have nought to ask.

    _Adam_.                        Nor aught to thank for?

    _Cain_.                                               No.

    _Adam_. Dost thou not _live_?

    _Cain_.                       Must I not die?

    _Eve_.                                          Alas!
    The fruit of our forbidden tree begins                              30
    To fall.

    _Adam_. And we must gather it again.
    Oh God! why didst thou plant the tree of knowledge?

    _Cain_. And wherefore plucked ye not the tree of life?
    Ye might have then defied him.

    _Adam_.                        Oh! my son,
    Blaspheme not: these are Serpent's words.

    _Cain_.                                   Why not?
    The snake spoke _truth_; it _was_ the Tree of Knowledge;
    It _was_ the Tree of Life: knowledge is good,
    And Life is good; and how can both be evil?

    _Eve_. My boy! thou speakest as I spoke in sin,
    Before thy birth: let me not see renewed                            40
    My misery in thine. I have repented.
    Let me not see my offspring fall into
    The snares beyond the walls of Paradise,
    Which even in Paradise destroyed his parents.
    Content thee with what _is_. Had we been so,
    Thou now hadst been contented.--Oh, my son!

    _Adam_. Our orisons completed, let us hence,
    Each to his task of toil--not heavy, though
    Needful: the earth is young, and yields us kindly
    Her fruits with little labour.

    _Eve_.                         Cain--my son--                       50
    Behold thy father cheerful and resigned--
    And do as he doth.                           [_Exeunt_ ADAM _and_ EVE.

    _Zillah_.          Wilt thou not, my brother?

    _Abel_. Why wilt thou wear this gloom upon thy brow,
    Which can avail thee nothing, save to rouse
    The Eternal anger?

    _Adah_.             My beloved Cain
    Wilt thou frown even on me?

    _Cain_.                      No, Adah! no;
    I fain would be alone a little while.
    Abel, I'm sick at heart; but it will pass;
    Precede me, brother--I will follow shortly.
    And you, too, sisters, tarry not behind;                            60
    Your gentleness must not be harshly met:
    I'll follow you anon.

    _Adah_.               If not, I will
    Return to seek you here.

    _Abel_.                   The peace of God
    Be on your spirit, brother!
                                       [_Exeunt_ ABEL, ZILLAH, _and_ ADAH.

    _Cain_ (_solus_).           And this is
    Life?--Toil! and wherefore should I toil?--because
    My father could not keep his place in Eden?
    What had _I_ done in this?--I was unborn:
    I sought not to be born; nor love the state
    To which that birth has brought me. Why did he
    Yield to the Serpent and the woman? or                              70
    Yielding--why suffer? What was there in this?
    The tree was planted, and why not for him?
    If not, why place him near it, where it grew
    The fairest in the centre? They have but
    One answer to all questions, "'Twas _his_ will,
    And _he_ is good." How know I that? Because
    He is all-powerful, must all-good, too, follow?
    I judge but by the fruits--and they are bitter--
    Which I must feed on for a fault not mine.
    Whom have we here?--A shape like to the angels                      80
    Yet of a sterner and a sadder aspect
    Of spiritual essence: why do I quake?
    Why should I fear him more than other spirits,
    Whom I see daily wave their fiery swords
    Before the gates round which I linger oft,
    In Twilight's hour, to catch a glimpse of those
    Gardens which are my just inheritance,
    Ere the night closes o'er the inhibited walls
    And the immortal trees which overtop
    The Cherubim-defended battlements?                                  90
    If I shrink not from these, the fire-armed angels,
    Why should I quail from him who now approaches?
    Yet--he seems mightier far than them, nor less
    Beauteous, and yet not all as beautiful
    As he hath been, and might be: sorrow seems
    Half of his immortality.[97] And is it
    So? and can aught grieve save Humanity?
    He cometh.

                             _Enter_ LUCIFER.

    _Lucifer_. Mortal!

    _Cain_.             Spirit, who art thou?

    _Lucifer_. Master of spirits.

    _Cain_.                        And being so, canst thou
    Leave them, and walk with dust?

    _Lucifer_.                     I know the thoughts                 100
    Of dust, and feel for it, and with you.

    _Cain_.                                How!
    You know my thoughts?

    _Lucifer_.            They are the thoughts of all
    Worthy of thought;--'tis your immortal part[98]
    Which speaks within you.

    _Cain_.                   What immortal part?
    This has not been revealed: the Tree of Life
    Was withheld from us by my father's folly,
    While that of Knowledge, by my mother's haste,
    Was plucked too soon; and all the fruit is Death!

    _Lucifer_. They have deceived thee; thou shalt live.

    _Cain_.                                               I live,
    But live to die; and, living, see no thing                         110
    To make death hateful, save an innate clinging,
    A loathsome, and yet all invincible
    Instinct of life, which I abhor, as I
    Despise myself, yet cannot overcome--
    And so I live. Would I had never lived!

    _Lucifer_. Thou livest--and must live for ever. Think not
    The Earth, which is thine outward cov'ring, is
    Existence--it will cease--and thou wilt be--
    No less than thou art now.

    _Cain_.                    No _less_! and why
    No more?

    _Lucifer_.    It may be thou shalt be as we.                       120

    _Cain_. And ye?

    _Lucifer_.      Are everlasting.

    _Cain_.                         Are ye happy?

    _Lucifer_. We are mighty.

    _Cain_.                    Are ye happy?

    _Lucifer_.                               No: art thou?

    _Cain_. How should I be so? Look on me!

    _Lucifer_.                               Poor clay!
    And thou pretendest to be wretched! Thou!

    _Cain_. I am:--and thou, with all thy might, what art thou?

    _Lucifer_. One who aspired to be what made thee, and
    Would not have made thee what thou art.

    _Cain_.                                 Ah!
    Thou look'st almost a god; and----

    _Lucifer_.                        I am none:
    And having failed to be one, would be nought
    Save what I am. He conquered; let him reign!                       130

    _Cain_. Who?

    _Lucifer_.   Thy Sire's maker--and the Earth's.

    _Cain_.                                        And Heaven's,
    And all that in them is. So I have heard
    His Seraphs sing; and so my father saith.

    _Lucifer_. They say--what they must sing and say, on pain
    Of being that which I am,--and thou art--
    Of spirits and of men.

    _Cain_.                And what is that?

    _Lucifer_. Souls who dare use their immortality--
    Souls who dare look the Omnipotent tyrant in
    His everlasting face, and tell him that
    His evil is not good! If he has made,                              140
    As he saith--which I know not, nor believe--
    But, if he made us--he cannot unmake:
    We are immortal!--nay, he'd _have_ us so,
    That he may torture:--let him! He is great--
    But, in his greatness, is no happier than
    We in our conflict! Goodness would not make
    Evil; and what else hath he made? But let him
    Sit on his vast and solitary throne--
    Creating worlds, to make eternity
    Less burthensome to his immense existence                          150
    And unparticipated solitude;[99]
    Let him crowd orb on orb: he is alone
    Indefinite, Indissoluble Tyrant;
    Could he but crush himself, 'twere the best boon
    He ever granted: but let him reign on!
    And multiply himself in misery!
    Spirits and Men, at least we sympathise--
    And, suffering in concert, make our pangs
    Innumerable, more endurable,
    By the unbounded sympathy of all                                   160
    With all! But _He_! so wretched in his height,
    So restless in his wretchedness, must still
    Create, and re-create--perhaps he'll make[100]
    One day a Son unto himself--as he
    Gave you a father--and if he so doth,
    Mark me! that Son will be a sacrifice!

    _Cain_. Thou speak'st to me of things which long have swum
    In visions through my thought: I never could
    Reconcile what I saw with what I heard.
    My father and my mother talk to me                                 170
    Of serpents, and of fruits and trees: I see
    The gates of what they call their Paradise
    Guarded by fiery-sworded Cherubim,
    Which shut them out--and me: I feel the weight
    Of daily toil, and constant thought: I look
    Around a world where I seem nothing, with
    Thoughts which arise within me, as if they
    Could master all things--but I thought alone
    This misery was _mine_. My father is
    Tamed down; my mother has forgot the mind                          180
    Which made her thirst for knowledge at the risk
    Of an eternal curse; my brother is
    A watching shepherd boy,[101] who offers up
    The firstlings of the flock to him who bids
    The earth yield nothing to us without sweat;[by]
    My sister Zillah sings an earlier hymn
    Than the birds' matins; and my Adah--my
    Own and beloved--she, too, understands not
    The mind which overwhelms me: never till
    Now met I aught to sympathise with me.                             190
    'Tis well--I rather would consort with spirits.

    _Lucifer_. And hadst thou not been fit by thine own soul
    For such companionship, I would not now
    Have stood before thee as I am: a serpent
    Had been enough to charm ye, as before.[bz]

    _Cain_. Ah! didst _thou_ tempt my mother?

    _Lucifer_.                                I tempt none,
    Save with the truth: was not the Tree, the Tree
    Of Knowledge? and was not the Tree of Life
    Still fruitful? Did _I_ bid her pluck them not?
    Did I plant things prohibited within                               200
    The reach of beings innocent, and curious
    By their own innocence? I would have made ye
    Gods; and even He who thrust ye forth, so thrust ye
    Because "ye should not eat the fruits of life,
    And become gods as we." Were those his words?

    _Cain_.   They were, as I have heard from those who heard them,
    In thunder.

    _Lucifer_.    Then who was the Demon? He
    Who would not let ye live, or he who would
    Have made ye live for ever, in the joy
    And power of Knowledge?

    _Cain_.                Would they had snatched both                210
    The fruits, or neither!

    _Lucifer_.              One is yours already,
    The other may be still.

    _Cain_.                  How so?

    _Lucifer_.                      By being
    Yourselves, in your resistance. Nothing can
    Quench the mind, if the mind will be itself
    And centre of surrounding things--'tis made
    To sway.

    _Cain_.   But didst thou tempt my parents?

    _Lucifer_.                                  I?
    Poor clay--what should I tempt them for, or how?

    _Cain_. They say the Serpent was a spirit.

    _Lucifer_.                                   Who
    Saith that? It is not written so on high:
    The proud One will not so far falsify,                             220
    Though man's vast fears and little vanity
    Would make him cast upon the spiritual nature
    His own low failing. The snake _was_ the snake--
    No more;[102] and yet not less than those he tempted,
    In nature being earth also--_more_ in _wisdom_,
    Since he could overcome them, and foreknew
    The knowledge fatal to their narrow joys.
    Think'st thou I'd take the shape of things that die?

    _Cain_. But the thing had a demon?

    _Lucifer_.                         He but woke one
    In those he spake to with his forky tongue.                        230
    I tell thee that the Serpent was no more
    Than a mere serpent: ask the Cherubim
    Who guard the tempting tree. When thousand ages
    Have rolled o'er your dead ashes, and your seed's,
    The seed of the then world may thus array
    Their earliest fault in fable, and attribute
    To me a shape I scorn, as I scorn all
    That bows to him, who made things but to bend
    Before his sullen, sole eternity;
    But we, who see the truth, must speak it. Thy                      240
    Fond parents listened to a creeping thing,
    And fell. For what should spirits tempt them? What
    Was there to envy in the narrow bounds
    Of Paradise, that spirits who pervade
    Space----but I speak to thee of what thou know'st not,
    With all thy Tree of Knowledge.

    _Cain_.                         But thou canst not
    Speak aught of Knowledge which I would not know,
    And do not thirst to know, and bear a mind
    To know.

    _Lucifer_.   And heart to look on?

    _Cain_.                           Be it proved.

    _Lucifer_. Darest thou look on Death?

    _Cain_.                                He has not yet              250
    Been seen.

    _Lucifer_. But must be undergone.

    _Cain_.                            My father
    Says he is something dreadful, and my mother
    Weeps when he's named; and Abel lifts his eyes
    To Heaven, and Zillah casts hers to the earth,
    And sighs a prayer; and Adah looks on me,
    And speaks not.

    _Lucifer_.     And thou?

    _Cain_.                 Thoughts unspeakable
    Crowd in my breast to burning, when I hear
    Of this almighty Death, who is, it seems,
    Inevitable. Could I wrestle with him?
    I wrestled with the lion, when a boy,                              260
    In play, till he ran roaring from my gripe.

    _Lucifer_. It has no shape; but will absorb all things
    That bear the form of earth-born being.

    _Cain_.                                 Ah!
    I thought it was a being: who could do
    Such evil things to beings save a being?

    _Lucifer_. Ask the Destroyer.

    _Cain_.                       Who?

    _Lucifer_.                        The Maker--Call him
    Which name thou wilt: he makes but to destroy.

    _Cain_. I knew not that, yet thought it, since I heard
    Of Death: although I know not what it is--
    Yet it seems horrible. I have looked out                           270
    In the vast desolate night in search of him;
    And when I saw gigantic shadows in
    The umbrage of the walls of Eden, chequered
    By the far-flashing of the Cherubs' swords,
    I watched for what I thought his coming; for
    With fear rose longing in my heart to know
    What 'twas which shook us all--but nothing came.
    And then I turned my weary eyes from off
    Our native and forbidden Paradise,
    Up to the lights above us, in the azure,                           280
    Which are so beautiful: shall they, too, die?

    _Lucifer_. Perhaps--but long outlive both thine and thee.

    _Cain_. I'm glad of that: I would not have them die--
    They are so lovely. What is Death? I fear,
    I feel, it is a dreadful thing; but what,
    I cannot compass: 'tis denounced against us,
    Both them who sinned and sinned not, as an ill--
    What ill?

    _Lucifer_. To be resolved into the earth.

    _Cain_. But shall I know it?

    _Lucifer_.                   As I know not death,
    I cannot answer.[103]

    _Cain_.              Were I quiet earth,                           290
    That were no evil: would I ne'er had been
    Aught else but dust!

    _Lucifer_.           That is a _grovelling_ wish,
    Less than thy father's--for he wished to know!

    _Cain_. But not to live--or wherefore plucked he not
    The Life-tree?

    _Lucifer_.    He was hindered.

    _Cain_.                       Deadly error!
    Not to snatch first that fruit:--but ere he plucked
    The knowledge, he was ignorant of Death.
    Alas! I scarcely now know what it is,
    And yet I fear it--fear I know not what!

    _Lucifer_. And I, who know all things, fear nothing; see           300
    What is true knowledge.

    _Cain_.                 Wilt thou teach me all?

    _Lucifer_. Aye, upon one condition.

    _Cain_.                              Name it.

    _Lucifer_.                                    That
    Thou dost fall down and worship me--thy Lord.

    _Cain_. Thou art not the Lord my father worships.

    _Lucifer_.                                         No.

    _Cain_. His equal?

    _Lucifer_.        No;--I have nought in common with him!
    Nor would: I would be aught above--beneath--
    Aught save a sharer or a servant of
    His power. I dwell apart; but I am great:--
    Many there are who worship me, and more
    Who shall--be thou amongst the first.

    _Cain_.                              I never                       310
    As yet have bowed unto my father's God.
    Although my brother Abel oft implores
    That I would join with him in sacrifice:--
    Why should I bow to thee?

    _Lucifer_.                 Hast thou ne'er bowed
    To him?

    _Cain_. Have I not said it?--need I say it?
    Could not thy mighty knowledge teach thee that?

    _Lucifer_. He who bows not to him has bowed to me.[104]

    _Cain_. But I will bend to neither.

    _Lucifer_.                          Ne'er the less,
    Thou art my worshipper; not worshipping
    Him makes thee mine the same.

    _Cain_.                       And what is that?                    320

    _Lucifer_. Thou'lt know here--and hereafter.

    _Cain_.                                      Let me but
    Be taught the mystery of my being.

    _Lucifer_.                        Follow
    Where I will lead thee.

    _Cain_.                 But I must retire
    To till the earth--for I had promised----

    _Lucifer_.                                What?

    _Cain_. To cull some first-fruits.

    _Lucifer_.                        Why?

    _Cain_.                               To offer up
    With Abel on an altar.

    _Lucifer_.            Said'st thou not
    Thou ne'er hadst bent to him who made thee?

    _Cain_.                                     Yes--
    But Abel's earnest prayer has wrought upon me;
    The offering is more his than mine--and Adah----

    _Lucifer_. Why dost thou hesitate?

    _Cain_.                           She is my sister,                330
    Born on the same day, of the same womb; and
    She wrung from me, with tears, this promise; and
    Rather than see her weep, I would, methinks,
    Bear all--and worship aught.

    _Lucifer_.                   Then follow me!

    _Cain_. I will.

                              _Enter_ ADAH.

    _Adah_.         My brother, I have come for thee;
    It is our hour of rest and joy--and we
    Have less without thee. Thou hast laboured not
    This morn; but I have done thy task: the fruits
    Are ripe, and glowing as the light which ripens:
    Come away.

    _Cain_.    Seest thou not?

    _Adah_.                    I see an angel;                         340
    We have seen many: will he share our hour
    Of rest?--he is welcome.

    _Cain_.                  But he is not like
    The angels we have seen.

    _Adah_.                  Are there, then, others?
    But he is welcome, as they were: they deigned
    To be our guests--will he?

    _Cain_ (_to Lucifer_).    Wilt thou?

    _Lucifer_.                          I ask
    Thee to be mine.

    _Cain_.          I must away with him.

    _Adah_. And leave us?

    _Cain_.                Aye.

    _Adah_.                     And _me_?

    _Cain_.                              Beloved Adah!

    _Adah_. Let me go with thee.

    _Lucifer_.                   No, she must not.

    _Adah_.                                       Who
    Art thou that steppest between heart and heart?

    _Cain_. He is a God.

    _Adah_.              How know'st thou?

    _Cain_.                               He speaks like               350
    A God.

    _Adah_. So did the Serpent, and it lied.

    _Lucifer_. Thou errest, Adah!--was not the Tree that
    Of Knowledge?

    _Adah_.      Aye--to our eternal sorrow.

    _Lucifer_. And yet that grief is knowledge--so he lied not:
    And if he did betray you, 'twas with Truth;
    And Truth in its own essence cannot be
    But good.

    _Adah_.    But all we know of it has gathered
    Evil on ill; expulsion from our home,
    And dread, and toil, and sweat, and heaviness;
    Remorse of that which was--and hope of that                        360
    Which cometh not. Cain! walk not with this Spirit.
    Bear with what we have borne, and love me--I
    Love thee.

    _Lucifer_. More than thy mother, and thy sire?

    _Adah_. I do. Is that a sin, too?

    _Lucifer_.                         No, not yet;
    It one day will be in your children.

    _Adah_.                             What!
    Must not my daughter love her brother Enoch?

    _Lucifer_. Not as thou lovest Cain.

    _Adah_.                             Oh, my God!
    Shall they not love and bring forth things that love
    Out of their love? have they not drawn their milk
    Out of this bosom? was not he, their father,                       370
    Born of the same sole womb,[105] in the same hour
    With me? did we not love each other? and
    In multiplying our being multiply
    Things which will love each other as we love
    Them?--And as I love thee, my Cain! go not
    Forth with this spirit; he is not of ours.

    _Lucifer_. The sin I speak of is not of my making,
    And cannot be a sin in you--whate'er
    It seem in those who will replace ye in
    Mortality[106].

    _Adah_. What is the sin which is not                               380
    Sin in itself? Can circumstance make sin
    Or virtue?--if it doth, we are the slaves
    Of----

    _Lucifer_. Higher things than ye are slaves: and higher
    Than them or ye would be so, did they not
    Prefer an independency of torture
    To the smooth agonies of adulation,
    In hymns and harpings, and self-seeking prayers,
    To that which is omnipotent, because
    It is omnipotent, and not from love,
    But terror and self-hope.

    _Adah_.                   Omnipotence                              390
    Must be all goodness.

    _Lucifer_.            Was it so in Eden?

    _Adah_. Fiend! tempt me not with beauty; thou art fairer
    Than was the Serpent, and as false.

    _Lucifer_.                          As true.
    Ask Eve, your mother: bears she not the knowledge
    Of good and evil?

    _Adah_.          Oh, my mother! thou
    Hast plucked a fruit more fatal to thine offspring
    Than to thyself; thou at the least hast passed
    Thy youth in Paradise, in innocent
    And happy intercourse with happy spirits:
    But we, thy children, ignorant of Eden,                            400
    Are girt about by demons, who assume
    The words of God, and tempt us with our own
    Dissatisfied and curious thoughts--as thou
    Wert worked on by the snake, in thy most flushed
    And heedless, harmless wantonness of bliss.
    I cannot answer this immortal thing
    Which stands before me; I cannot abhor him;
    I look upon him with a pleasing fear,
    And yet I fly not from him: in his eye
    There is a fastening attraction which                              410
    Fixes my fluttering eyes on his; my heart
    Beats quick; he awes me, and yet draws me near,
    Nearer and nearer:--Cain--Cain--save me from him!

    _Cain_. What dreads my Adah? This is no ill spirit.

    _Adah_. He is not God--nor God's: I have beheld
    The Cherubs and the Seraphs; he looks not
    Like them.

    _Cain_.   But there are spirits loftier still--
    The archangels.

    _Lucifer_.     And still loftier than the archangels.

    _Adah_. Aye--but not blessed.

    _Lucifer_.                    If the blessedness
    Consists in slavery--no.

    _Adah_.                 I have heard it said,                      420
    The Seraphs _love most_--Cherubim _know most_[107]--
    And this should be a Cherub--since he loves not.

    _Lucifer_. And if the higher knowledge quenches love,
    What must _he be_ you cannot love when known?[ca]
    Since the all-knowing Cherubim love least,
    The Seraphs' love can be but ignorance:
    That they are not compatible, the doom
    Of thy fond parents, for their daring, proves.
    Choose betwixt Love and Knowledge--since there is
    No other choice: your sire hath chosen already:                    430
    His worship is but fear.

    _Adah_.                 Oh, Cain! choose Love.

    _Cain_. For thee, my Adah, I choose not--It was
    Born with me--but I love nought else.

    _Adah_.                              Our parents?

    _Cain_. Did they love us when they snatched from the Tree
    That which hath driven us all from Paradise?

    _Adah_. We were not born then--and if we had been,
    Should we not love them--and our children, Cain?

    _Cain_. My little Enoch! and his lisping sister!
    Could I but deem them happy, I would half
    Forget----but it can never be forgotten                            440
    Through thrice a thousand generations! never
    Shall men love the remembrance of the man
    Who sowed the seed of evil and mankind
    In the same hour! They plucked the tree of science
    And sin--and, not content with their own sorrow,
    Begot _me_--_thee_--and all the few that are,
    And all the unnumbered and innumerable
    Multitudes, millions, myriads, which may be,
    To inherit agonies accumulated
    By ages!--and _I_ must be sire of such things!                     450
    Thy beauty and thy love--my love and joy,
    The rapturous moment and the placid hour,
    All we love in our children and each other,
    But lead them and ourselves through many years
    Of sin and pain--or few, but still of sorrow,
    Interchecked with an instant of brief pleasure,
    To Death--the unknown! Methinks the Tree of Knowledge
    Hath not fulfilled its promise:--if they sinned,
    At least they ought to have known all things that are
    Of knowledge--and the mystery of Death[cb].                        460
    What do they know?--that they are miserable.
    What need of snakes and fruits to teach us that?

    _Adah_. I am not wretched, Cain, and if thou
    Wert happy----

    _Cain_.       Be thou happy, then, alone--
    I will have nought to do with happiness,
    Which humbles me and mine.

    _Adah_.                    Alone I could not,
    Nor _would_ be happy; but with those around us
    I think I could be so, despite of Death,
    Which, as I know it not, I dread not, though
    It seems an awful shadow--if I may                                 470
    Judge from what I have heard.

    _Lucifer_.                    And thou couldst not
    _Alone_, thou say'st, be happy?

    _Adah_.                         Alone! Oh, my God!
    Who could be happy and alone, or good?
    To me my solitude seems sin; unless
    When I think how soon I shall see my brother,
    His brother, and our children, and our parents.

    _Lucifer_. Yet thy God is alone; and is he happy?
    Lonely, and good?

    _Adah_.           He is not so; he hath
    The angels and the mortals to make happy,
    And thus becomes so in diffusing joy.                              480
    What else can joy be, but the spreading joy?[cc]

    _Lucifer_. Ask of your sire, the exile fresh from Eden;
    Or of his first-born son: ask your own heart;
    It is not tranquil.

    _Adah_.            Alas! no! and you--
    Are you of Heaven?

    _Lucifer_.         If I am not, enquire
    The cause of this all-spreading happiness
    (Which you proclaim) of the all-great and good
    Maker of life and living things; it is
    His secret, and he keeps it. _We_ must bear,
    And some of us resist--and both in vain,                           490
    His Seraphs say: but it is worth the trial,
    Since better may not be without: there is
    A wisdom in the spirit, which directs
    To right, as in the dim blue air the eye
    Of you, young mortals, lights at once upon
    The star which watches, welcoming the morn.

    _Adah_. It is a beautiful star; I love it for
    Its beauty.

    _Lucifer_.    And why not adore?

    _Adah_.                         Our father
    Adores the Invisible only.

    _Lucifer_.                But the symbols
    Of the Invisible are the loveliest                                 500
    Of what is visible; and yon bright star
    Is leader of the host of Heaven.

    _Adah_.                         Our father
    Saith that he has beheld the God himself
    Who made him and our mother.

    _Lucifer_.                  Hast _thou_ seen him?

    _Adah_. Yes--in his works.

    _Lucifer_.                 But in his being?

    _Adah_.                                     No--
    Save in my father, who is God's own image;
    Or in his angels, who are like to thee--
    And brighter, yet less beautiful and powerful
    In seeming: as the silent sunny noon,
    All light, they look upon us; but thou seem'st                     510
    Like an ethereal night[108], where long white clouds
    Streak the deep purple, and unnumbered stars
    Spangle the wonderful mysterious vault
    With things that look as if they would be suns;
    So beautiful, unnumbered, and endearing,
    Not dazzling, and yet drawing us to them,
    They fill my eyes with tears, and so dost thou.
    Thou seem'st unhappy: do not make us so,
    And I will weep for thee.

    _Lucifer_.                Alas! those tears!
    Couldst thou but know what oceans will be shed----                 520

    _Adah_. By me?

    _Lucifer_.     By all.

    _Adah_.               What all?

    _Lucifer_.                     The million millions--
    The myriad myriads--the all-peopled earth--
    The unpeopled earth--and the o'er-peopled Hell,
    Of which thy bosom is the germ.

    _Adah_.                        O Cain!
    This spirit curseth us.

    _Cain_.                Let him say on;
    Him will I follow.

    _Adah_.            Whither?

    _Lucifer_.                 To a place
    _Whence_ he shall come back to thee in an hour;
    But in that hour see things of many days.

    _Adah_. How can that be?

    _Lucifer_.               Did not your Maker make
    Out of old worlds this new one in few days?                        530
    And cannot I, who aided in this work,
    Show in an hour what he hath made in many,
    Or hath destroyed in few?

    _Cain_.                  Lead on.

    _Adah_.                          Will he,
    In sooth, return within an hour?

    _Lucifer_.                       He shall.
    With us acts are exempt from time, and we
    Can crowd eternity into an hour,
    Or stretch an hour into eternity:
    We breathe not by a mortal measurement--
    But that's a mystery. Cain, come on with me.

    _Adah_. Will he return?

    _Lucifer_.              Aye, woman! he alone                       540
    Of mortals from that place (the first and last
    Who shall return, save ONE), shall come back to thee,
    To make that silent and expectant world
    As populous as this: at present there
    Are few inhabitants.

    _Adah_.             Where dwellest thou?

    _Lucifer_. Throughout all space. Where should I dwell? Where are
    Thy God or Gods--there am I: all things are
    Divided with me: Life and Death--and Time--
    Eternity--and heaven and earth--and that
    Which is not heaven nor earth, but peopled with                    550
    Those who once peopled or shall people both--
    These are my realms! so that I do divide
    _His_, and possess a kingdom which is not
    _His_[109]. If I were not that which I have said,
    Could I stand here? His angels are within
    Your vision.

    _Adah_.      So they were when the fair Serpent
    Spoke with our mother first.

    _Lucifer_.                  Cain! thou hast heard.
    If thou dost long for knowledge, I can satiate
    That thirst; nor ask thee to partake of fruits
    Which shall deprive thee of a single good                          560
    The Conqueror has left thee. Follow me.

    _Cain_. Spirit, I have said it.
                                             [_Exeunt_ LUCIFER _and_ CAIN.

    _Adah_ (_follows exclaiming_).  Cain! my brother! Cain!




                                 ACT II.


                     SCENE I.--_The Abyss of Space_.

    _Cain_. I tread on air, and sink not--yet I fear
    To sink.

    _Lucifer_. Have faith in me, and thou shalt be
    Borne on the air[110], of which I am the Prince.

    _Cain_. Can I do so without impiety?

    _Lucifer_. Believe--and sink not! doubt--and perish! thus
    Would run the edict of the other God,
    Who names me Demon to his angels; they
    Echo the sound to miserable things,
    Which, knowing nought beyond their shallow senses,
    Worship the _word_ which strikes their ear, and deem                10
    Evil or good what is proclaimed to them
    In their abasement. I will have none such:
    Worship or worship not, thou shalt behold
    The worlds beyond thy little world, nor be
    Amerced for doubts beyond thy little life,
    With torture of _my_ dooming. There will come
    An hour, when, tossed upon some water-drops[cd],
    A man shall say to a man, "Believe in me,
    And walk the waters;" and the man shall walk
    The billows and be safe. _I_ will not say,                          20
    Believe in _me_, as a conditional creed
    To save thee; but fly with me o'er the gulf
    Of space an equal flight, and I will show
    What thou dar'st not deny,--the history
    Of past--and present, and of future worlds.

    _Cain_. Oh God! or Demon! or whate'er thou art,
    Is yon our earth?

    _Lucifer_.        Dost thou not recognise
    The dust which formed your father?

    _Cain_.                            Can it be?
    Yon small blue circle, swinging in far ether[ce],
    With an inferior circlet purpler it still[111],                     30
    Which looks like that which lit our earthly night?
    Is this our Paradise? Where are its walls,
    And they who guard them?

    _Lucifer_.               Point me out the site
    Of Paradise.

    _Cain_.      How should I? As we move
    Like sunbeams onward, it grows small and smaller,
    And as it waxes little, and then less,
    Gathers a halo round it, like the light
    Which shone the roundest of the stars, when I
    Beheld them from the skirts of Paradise:
    Methinks they both, as we recede from them,                         40
    Appear to join the innumerable stars
    Which are around us; and, as we move on,
    Increase their myriads.

    _Lucifer_.              And if there should be
    Worlds greater than thine own--inhabited
    By greater things--and they themselves far more
    In number than the dust of thy dull earth,
    Though multiplied to animated atoms,
    All living--and all doomed to death--and wretched,
    What wouldst thou think?

    _Cain_.                  I should be proud of thought
    Which knew such things.

    _Lucifer_.              But if that high thought were               50
    Linked to a servile mass of matter--and,
    Knowing such things, aspiring to such things,
    And science still beyond them, were chained down
    To the most gross and petty paltry wants,
    All foul and fulsome--and the very best
    Of thine enjoyments a sweet degradation,
    A most enervating and filthy cheat
    To lure thee on to the renewal of
    Fresh souls and bodies[112], all foredoomed to be
    As frail, and few so happy----

    _Cain_.                        Spirit! I                            60
    Know nought of Death, save as a dreadful thing
    Of which I have heard my parents speak, as of
    A hideous heritage I owe to them
    No less than life--a heritage not happy,
    If I may judge, till now. But, Spirit! if
    It be as thou hast said (and I within
    Feel the prophetic torture of its truth),
    Here let me die: for to give birth to those
    Who can but suffer many years, and die--
    Methinks is merely propagating Death,                               70
    And multiplying murder.

    _Lucifer_.              Thou canst not
    _All_ die--there is what must survive.

    _Cain_.                                The Other
    Spake not of this unto my father, when
    He shut him forth from Paradise, with death
    Written upon his forehead. But at least
    Let what is mortal of me perish, that
    I may be in the rest as angels are.

    _Lucifer_. _I_ am angelic: wouldst thou be as I am?

    _Cain_. I know not what thou art: I see thy power,
    And see thou show'st me things beyond _my_ power,                   80
    Beyond all power of my born faculties,
    Although inferior still to my desires
    And my conceptions.

    _Lucifer_.          What are they which dwell
    So humbly in their pride, as to sojourn
    With worms in clay?

    _Cain_.            And what art thou who dwellest
    So haughtily in spirit, and canst range
    Nature and immortality--and yet
    Seem'st sorrowful?

    _Lucifer_.         I seem that which I am;
    And therefore do I ask of thee, if thou
    Wouldst be immortal?

    _Cain_.             Thou hast said, I must be                       90
    Immortal in despite of me. I knew not
    This until lately--but since it must be,
    Let me, or happy or unhappy, learn
    To anticipate my immortality.

    _Lucifer_. Thou didst before I came upon thee.

    _Cain_.                                        How?

    _Lucifer_. By suffering.

    _Cain_.                  And must torture be immortal?

    _Lucifer_. We and thy sons will try. But now, behold!
    Is it not glorious?

    _Cain_.             Oh thou beautiful
    And unimaginable ether! and
    Ye multiplying masses of increased                                 100
    And still-increasing lights! what are ye? what
    Is this blue wilderness of interminable
    Air, where ye roll along, as I have seen
    The leaves along the limpid streams of Eden?
    Is your course measured for ye? Or do ye
    Sweep on in your unbounded revelry
    Through an aerial universe of endless
    Expansion--at which my soul aches to think--
    Intoxicated with eternity[113]?
    Oh God! Oh Gods! or whatsoe'er ye are!                             110
    How beautiful ye are! how beautiful
    Your works, or accidents, or whatsoe'er
    They may be! Let me die, as atoms die,
    (If that they die), or know ye in your might
    And knowledge! My thoughts are not in this hour
    Unworthy what I see, though my dust is;
    Spirit! let me expire, or see them nearer.

    _Lucifer_. Art thou not nearer? look back to thine earth!

    _Cain_. Where is it? I see nothing save a mass
    Of most innumerable lights.

    _Lucifer_.                  Look there!                            120

    _Cain_. I cannot see it.

    _Lucifer_.               Yet it sparkles still.

    _Cain_. That!--yonder!

    _Lucifer_.            Yea.

    _Cain_.                   And wilt thou tell me so?
    Why, I have seen the fire-flies and fire-worms
    Sprinkle the dusky groves and the green banks
    In the dim twilight, brighter than yon world
    Which bears them.

    _Lucifer_.        Thou hast seen both worms and worlds,
    Each bright and sparkling--what dost think of them?

    _Cain_. That they are beautiful in their own sphere,
    And that the night, which makes both beautiful,
    The little shining fire-fly in its flight,                         130
    And the immortal star in its great course,
    Must both be guided.

    _Lucifer_.           But by whom or what?

    _Cain_. Show me.

    _Lucifer_.       Dar'st thou behold?

    _Cain_.                            How know I what
    I _dare_ behold? As yet, thou hast shown nought
    I dare not gaze on further.

    _Lucifer_.                  On, then, with me.
    Wouldst thou behold things mortal or immortal?

    _Cain_. Why, what are things?

    _Lucifer_.                  _Both_ partly: but what doth
    Sit next thy heart?

    _Cain_.            The things I see.

    _Lucifer_.                          But what
    _Sate_ nearest it?

    _Cain_.           The things I have not seen,
    Nor ever shall--the mysteries of Death.                            140

    _Lucifer_. What, if I show to thee things which have died,
    As I have shown thee much which cannot die?

    _Cain_. Do so.

    _Lucifer_.     Away, then! on our mighty wings!

    _Cain_. Oh! how we cleave the blue! The stars fade from us!
    The earth! where is my earth? Let me look on it,
    For I was made of it.

    _Lucifer_.           'Tis now beyond thee,
    Less, in the universe, than thou in it;
    Yet deem not that thou canst escape it; thou
    Shalt soon return to earth, and all its dust:
    'Tis part of thy eternity, and mine.                               150

    _Cain_. Where dost thou lead me?

    _Lucifer_.                      To what was before thee!
    The phantasm of the world; of which thy world
    Is but the wreck.

    _Cain_.           What! is it not then new?

    _Lucifer_. No more than life is; and that was ere thou
    Or _I_ were, or the things which seem to us
    Greater than either: many things will have
    No end; and some, which would pretend to have
    Had no beginning, have had one as mean
    As thou; and mightier things have been extinct
    To make way for much meaner than we can                            160
    Surmise; for _moments_ only and the _space_
    Have been and must be all _unchangeable_.
    But changes make not death, except to clay;
    But thou art clay--and canst but comprehend
    That which was clay, and such thou shall behold.

    _Cain_. Clay--Spirit--what thou wilt--I can survey.

    _Lucifer_. Away, then!

    _Cain_.                But the lights fade from me fast,
    And some till now grew larger as we approached,
    And wore the look of worlds.

    _Lucifer_.                   And such they are.

    _Cain_. And Edens in them?

    _Lucifer_.                 It may be.

    _Cain_.                              And men?                      170

    _Lucifer_. Yea, or things higher.

    _Cain_.                           Aye! and serpents too?[cf]

    _Lucifer_. Wouldst thou have men without them? must no reptiles
    Breathe, save the erect ones?

    _Cain_.                       How the lights recede!
    Where fly we?

    _Lucifer_.    To the world of phantoms, which
    Are beings past, and shadows still to come.

    _Cain_. But it grows dark, and dark--the stars are gone!

    _Lucifer_. And yet thou seest.

    _Cain_.                       'Tis a fearful light!
    No sun--no moon--no lights innumerable--
    The very blue of the empurpled night
    Fades to a dreary twilight--yet I see                              180
    Huge dusky masses; but unlike the worlds
    We were approaching, which, begirt with light,
    Seemed full of life even when their atmosphere
    Of light gave way, and showed them taking shapes
    Unequal, of deep valleys and vast mountains;
    And some emitting sparks, and some displaying
    Enormous liquid plains, and some begirt
    With luminous belts, and floating moons, which took,
    Like them, the features of fair earth:--instead,
    All here seems dark and dreadful.

    _Lucifer_.                         But distinct.                   190
    Thou seekest to behold Death, and dead things?

    _Cain_. I seek it not; but as I know there are
    Such, and that my sire's sin makes him and me,
    And all that we inherit, liable
    To such, I would behold, at once, what I
    Must one day see perforce.

    _Lucifer_.                  Behold!

    _Cain_.                            'Tis darkness!

    _Lucifer_. And so it shall be ever--but we will
    Unfold its gates!

    _Cain_.           Enormous vapours roll
    Apart--what's this?

    _Lucifer_.          Enter!

    _Cain_.                   Can I return?

    _Lucifer_. Return! be sure: how else should Death be peopled?      200
    Its present realm is thin to what it will be,
    Through thee and thine.

    _Cain_.                 The clouds still open wide
    And wider, and make widening circles round us!

    _Lucifer_. Advance!

    _Cain_.             And thou!

    _Lucifer_.                   Fear not--without me thou
    Couldst not have gone beyond thy world. On! on!
                                     [_They disappear through the clouds_.


                           SCENE II.--_Hades_.


                       _Enter_ LUCIFER _and_ CAIN.

    _Cain_. How silent and how vast are these dim worlds!
    For they seem more than one, and yet more peopled
    Than the huge brilliant luminous orbs which swung
    So thickly in the upper air, that I
    Had deemed them rather the bright populace
    Of some all unimaginable Heaven,
    Than things to be inhabited themselves,[cg]
    But that on drawing near them I beheld
    Their swelling into palpable immensity
    Of matter, which seemed made for life to dwell on,                  10
    Rather than life itself. But here, all is
    So shadowy, and so full of twilight, that
    It speaks of a day past.

    _Lucifer_.              It is the realm
    Of Death.--Wouldst have it present?

    _Cain_.                             Till I know
    That which it really is, I cannot answer.
    But if it be as I have heard my father
    Deal out in his long homilies, 'tis a thing--
    Oh God! I dare not think on't! Cursed be
    He who invented Life that leads to Death!
    Or the dull mass of life, that, being life,                         20
    Could not retain, but needs must forfeit it--
    Even for the innocent!

    _Lucifer_.             Dost thou curse thy father?

    _Cain_. Cursed he not me in giving me my birth?
    Cursed he not me before my birth, in daring
    To pluck the fruit forbidden?

    _Lucifer_.                    Thou say'st well:
    The curse is mutual 'twixt thy sire and thee--
    But for thy sons and brother?

    _Cain_.                       Let them share it
    With me, their sire and brother! What else is
    Bequeathed to me? I leave them my inheritance!
    Oh, ye interminable gloomy realms                                   30
    Of swimming shadows and enormous shapes,
    Some fully shown, some indistinct, and all
    Mighty and melancholy--what are ye?
    Live ye, or have ye lived?

    _Lucifer_.                 Somewhat of both.

    _Cain_. Then what is Death?

    _Lucifer_.                  What? Hath not he who made ye
    Said 'tis another life?

    _Cain_.                 Till now he hath
    Said nothing, save that all shall die.

    _Lucifer_.                             Perhaps
    He one day will unfold that further secret.

    _Cain_. Happy the day!

    _Lucifer_.             Yes; happy! when unfolded,
    Through agonies unspeakable, and clogged                            40
    With agonies eternal, to innumerable
    Yet unborn myriads of unconscious atoms,
    All to be animated for this only!

    _Cain_. What are these mighty phantoms which I see
    Floating around me?--They wear not the form
    Of the Intelligences I have seen
    Round our regretted and unentered Eden;
    Nor wear the form of man as I have viewed it
    In Adam's and in Abel's, and in mine,
    Nor in my sister-bride's, nor in my children's:                     50
    And yet they have an aspect, which, though not
    Of men nor angels, looks like something, which,
    If not the last, rose higher than the first,
    Haughty, and high, and beautiful, and full
    Of seeming strength, but of inexplicable
    Shape; for I never saw such. They bear not
    The wing of Seraph, nor the face of man,
    Nor form of mightiest brute, nor aught that is
    Now breathing; mighty yet and beautiful
    As the most beautiful and mighty which                              60
    Live, and yet so unlike them, that I scarce
    Can call them living.[114]

    _Lucifer_.               Yet they lived.

    _Cain_.                                  Where?

    _Lucifer_.                                      Where
    Thou livest.

    _Cain_.     When?

    _Lucifer_.       On what thou callest earth
    They did inhabit.

    _Cain_.           Adam is the first.

    _Lucifer_. Of thine, I grant thee--but too mean to be
    The last of these.

    _Cain_.            And what are they?

    _Lucifer_.                           That which
    Thou shalt be.

    _Cain_.        But what _were_ they?

    _Lucifer_.                          Living, high,
    Intelligent, good, great, and glorious things,
    As much superior unto all thy sire
    Adam could e'er have been in Eden, as                               70
    The sixty-thousandth generation shall be,
    In its dull damp degeneracy, to
    Thee and thy son;--and how weak they are, judge
    By thy own flesh.

    _Cain_.           Ah me! and did _they_ perish?

    _Lucifer_. Yes, from their earth, as thou wilt fade from thine.

    _Cain_. But was _mine_ theirs?

    _Lucifer_.                      It was.

    _Cain_.                                But not as now.
    It is too little and too lowly to
    Sustain such creatures.

    _Lucifer_.              True, it was more glorious.

    _Cain_. And wherefore did it fall?

    _Lucifer_.                         Ask him who fells.[115]

    _Cain_. But how?

    _Lucifer_.        By a most crushing and inexorable                 80
    Destruction and disorder of the elements,
    Which struck a world to chaos, as a chaos
    Subsiding has struck out a world: such things,
    Though rare in time, are frequent in eternity.--
    Pass on, and gaze upon the past.

    _Cain_.                          'Tis awful!

    _Lucifer_. And true. Behold these phantoms! they were once
    Material as thou art.

    _Cain_.               And must I be
    Like them?

    _Lucifer_. Let He[116] who made thee answer that.
    I show thee what thy predecessors are,
    And what they _were_ thou feelest, in degree                        90
    Inferior as thy petty feelings and
    Thy pettier portion of the immortal part
    Of high intelligence and earthly strength.
    What ye in common have with what they had
    Is Life, and what ye _shall_ have--Death: the rest
    Of your poor attributes is such as suits
    Reptiles engendered out of the subsiding
    Slime of a mighty universe, crushed into
    A scarcely-yet shaped planet, peopled with
    Things whose enjoyment was to be in blindness--                    100
    A Paradise of Ignorance, from which
    Knowledge was barred as poison. But behold
    What these superior beings are or were;
    Or, if it irk thee, turn thee back and till
    The earth, thy task--I'll waft thee there in safety.

    _Cain_. No: I'll stay here.

    _Lucifer_.                   How long?

    _Cain_.                               For ever! Since
    I must one day return here from the earth,
    I rather would remain; I am sick of all
    That dust has shown me--let me dwell in shadows.

    _Lucifer_. It cannot be: thou now beholdest as                     110
    A vision that which is reality.
    To make thyself fit for this dwelling, thou
    Must pass through what the things thou seest have passed--
    The gates of Death.

    _Cain_.             By what gate have we entered
    Even now?

    _Lucifer_. By mine! But, plighted to return,
    My spirit buoys thee up to breathe in regions
    Where all is breathless save thyself. Gaze on;
    But do not think to dwell here till thine hour
    Is come!

    _Cain_. And these, too--can they ne'er repass
    To earth again?

    _Lucifer_.      _Their_ earth is gone for ever--                   120
    So changed by its convulsion, they would not
    Be conscious to a single present spot
    Of its new scarcely hardened surface--'twas--
    Oh, what a beautiful world it _was_!

    _Cain_.                               And is!
    It is not with the earth, though I must till it,
    I feel at war--but that I may not profit
    By what it bears of beautiful, untoiling,
    Nor gratify my thousand swelling thoughts
    With knowledge, nor allay my thousand fears
    Of Death and Life.

    _Lucifer_.       What thy world is, thou see'st,                   130
    But canst not comprehend the shadow of
    That which it was.

    _Cain_.            And those enormous creatures,
    Phantoms inferior in intelligence
    (At least so seeming) to the things we have passed,
    Resembling somewhat the wild habitants
    Of the deep woods of earth, the hugest which
    Roar nightly in the forest, but ten-fold
    In magnitude and terror; taller than
    The cherub-guarded walls of Eden--with
    Eyes flashing like the fiery swords which fence them--             140
    And tusks projecting like the trees stripped of
    Their bark and branches--what were they?

    _Lucifer_.                               That which
    The Mammoth is in thy world;--but these lie
    By myriads underneath its surface.

    _Cain_.                            But
    None on it?

    _Lucifer_.   No: for thy frail race to war
    With them would render the curse on it useless--
    'Twould be destroyed so early.

    _Cain_.                        But why _war_?

    _Lucifer_. You have forgotten the denunciation
    Which drove your race from Eden--war with all things,
    And death to all things, and disease to most things,               150
    And pangs, and bitterness; these were the fruits
    Of the forbidden tree.

    _Cain_.                But animals--
    Did they, too, eat of it, that they must die?

    _Lucifer_. Your Maker told ye, _they_ were made for you,
    As you for him.--You would not have their doom
    Superior to your own? Had Adam not
    Fallen, all had stood.

    _Cain_.                 Alas! the hopeless wretches!
    They too must share my sire's fate, like his sons;
    Like them, too, without having shared the apple;
    Like them, too, without the so dear-bought _knowledge_!            160
    It was a lying tree--for we _know_ nothing.
    At least it _promised knowledge_ at the _price_
    Of death--but _knowledge_ still: but what _knows_ man?

    _Lucifer_. It may be death leads to the _highest_ knowledge;
    And being of all things the sole thing certain,[ch]
    At least leads to the _surest_ science: therefore
    The Tree was true, though deadly.

    _Cain_.                          These dim realms!
    I see them, but I know them not.

    _Lucifer_.                    Because
    Thy hour is yet afar, and matter cannot
    Comprehend spirit wholly--but 'tis something                       170
    To know there are such realms.

    _Cain_.                        We knew already
    That there was Death.

    _Lucifer_.            But not what was beyond it.

    _Cain_. Nor know I now.

    _Lucifer_.             Thou knowest that there is
    A state, and many states beyond thine own--
    And this thou knewest not this morn.

    _Cain_.                              But all
    Seems dim and shadowy.

    _Lucifer_.             Be content; it will
    Seem clearer to thine immortality.

    _Cain_. And yon immeasurable liquid space
    Of glorious azure which floats on beyond us,
    Which looks like water, and which I should deem[ci]                180
    The river which flows out of Paradise
    Past my own dwelling, but that it is bankless
    And boundless, and of an ethereal hue--
    What is it?

    _Lucifer_.   There is still some such on earth,
    Although inferior, and thy children shall
    Dwell near it--'tis the phantasm of an Ocean.

    _Cain_. 'Tis like another world; a liquid sun--
    And those inordinate creatures sporting o'er
    Its shining surface?

    _Lucifer_.           Are its inhabitants,
    The past Leviathans.

    _Cain_.               And yon immense                              190
    Serpent, which rears his dripping mane and vasty
    Head, ten times higher than the haughtiest cedar,
    Forth from the abyss, looking as he could coil
    Himself around the orbs we lately looked on--
    Is he not of the kind which basked beneath
    The Tree in Eden?

    _Lucifer_.         Eve, thy mother, best
    Can tell what shape of serpent tempted her.

    _Cain_. This seems too terrible. No doubt the other
    Had more of beauty.

    _Lucifer_.           Hast thou ne'er beheld him?

    _Cain_. Many of the same kind (at least so called)                 200
    But never that precisely, which persuaded
    The fatal fruit, nor even of the same aspect.

    _Lucifer_. Your father saw him not?

    _Cain_.                             No: 'twas my mother
    Who tempted him--she tempted by the serpent.

    _Lucifer_. Good man! whene'er thy wife, or thy sons' wives,
    Tempt thee or them to aught that's new or strange,
    Be sure thou seest first who hath tempted _them_!

    _Cain_. Thy precept comes too late: there is no more
    For serpents to tempt woman to.

    _Lucifer_.                      But there
    Are some things still which woman may tempt man to,                210
    And man tempt woman:--let thy sons look to it!
    My counsel is a kind one; for 'tis even
    Given chiefly at my own expense; 'tis true,
    'Twill not be followed, so there's little lost.[117]

    _Cain_. I understand not this.

    _Lucifer_.                     The happier thou!--
    Thy world and thou are still too young! Thou thinkest
    Thyself most wicked and unhappy--is it
    Not so?

    _Cain_. For crime, I know not; but for pain,
    I have felt much.

    _Lucifer_.        First-born of the first man!
    Thy present state of sin--and thou art evil,                       220
    Of sorrow--and thou sufferest, are both Eden
    In all its innocence compared to what
    _Thou_ shortly may'st be; and that state again,
    In its redoubled wretchedness, a Paradise
    To what thy sons' sons' sons, accumulating
    In generations like to dust (which they
    In fact but add to), shall endure and do.--
    Now let us back to earth!

    _Cain_.                   And wherefore didst thou
    Lead me here only to inform me this?

    _Lucifer_. Was not thy quest for knowledge?

    _Cain_.                                     Yes--as being          230
    The road to happiness!

    _Lucifer_.             If truth be so,
    Thou hast it.

    _Cain_.       Then my father's God did well
    When he prohibited the fatal Tree.

    _Lucifer_. But had done better in not planting it.
    But ignorance of evil doth not save
    From evil; it must still roll on the same,
    A part of all things.

    _Cain_.               Not of all things. No--
    I'll not believe it--for I thirst for good.

    _Lucifer_. And who and what doth not? _Who_ covets evil
    For its own bitter sake?--_None_--nothing! 'tis                    240
    The leaven of all life, and lifelessness.

    _Cain_. Within those glorious orbs which we behold,
    Distant, and dazzling, and innumerable,
    Ere we came down into this phantom realm,
    Ill cannot come: they are too beautiful.

    _Lucifer_. Thou hast seen them from afar.

    _Cain_.                                   And what of that?
    Distance can but diminish glory--they,
    When nearer, must be more ineffable.

    _Lucifer_. Approach the things of earth most beautiful,
    And judge their beauty near.

    _Cain_.                      I have done this--                    250
    The loveliest thing I know is loveliest nearest.

    _Lucifer_. Then there must be delusion.--What is that
    Which being nearest to thine eyes is still
    More beautiful than beauteous things remote?

    _Cain_. My sister Adah.--All the stars of heaven,
    The deep blue noon of night, lit by an orb
    Which looks a spirit, or a spirit's world--
    The hues of twilight--the Sun's gorgeous coming--
    His setting indescribable, which fills
    My eyes with pleasant tears as I behold                            260
    Him sink, and feel my heart float softly with him
    Along that western paradise of clouds--
    The forest shade, the green bough, the bird's voice--
    The vesper bird's, which seems to sing of love,
    And mingles with the song of Cherubim,
    As the day closes over Eden's walls;--
    All these are nothing, to my eyes and heart,
    Like Adah's face: I turn from earth and heaven
    To gaze on it.

    _Lucifer_.      'Tis fair as frail mortality,
    In the first dawn and bloom of young creation,                     270
    And earliest embraces of earth's parents,
    Can make its offspring; still it is delusion.

    _Cain_. You think so, being not her brother.

    _Lucifer_.                                    Mortal!
    My brotherhood's with those who have no children.

    _Cain_. Then thou canst have no fellowship with us.

    _Lucifer_. It may be that thine own shall be for me.
    But if thou dost possess a beautiful
    Being beyond all beauty in thine eyes,
    Why art thou wretched?

    _Cain_.                Why do I exist?
    Why art _thou_ wretched? why are all things so?                    280
    Ev'n he who made us must be, as the maker
    Of things unhappy! To produce destruction
    Can surely never be the task of joy,
    And yet my sire says he's omnipotent:
    Then why is Evil--he being Good? I asked
    This question of my father; and he said,
    Because this Evil only was the path
    To Good. Strange Good, that must arise from out
    Its deadly opposite. I lately saw
    A lamb stung by a reptile: the poor suckling                       290
    Lay foaming on the earth, beneath the vain
    And piteous bleating of its restless dam;
    My father plucked some herbs, and laid them to
    The wound; and by degrees the helpless wretch
    Resumed its careless life, and rose to drain
    The mother's milk, who o'er it tremulous
    Stood licking its reviving limbs with joy.
    Behold, my son! said Adam, how from Evil
    Springs Good![118]

    _Lucifer_.     What didst thou answer?

    _Cain_.                                Nothing; for
    He is my father: but I thought, that 'twere                        300
    A better portion for the animal
    Never to have been _stung at all_, than to
    Purchase renewal of its little life
    With agonies unutterable, though
    Dispelled by antidotes.

    _Lucifer_.             But as thou saidst
    Of all beloved things thou lovest her
    Who shared thy mother's milk, and giveth hers
    Unto thy children----

    _Cain_.               Most assuredly:
    What should I be without her?

    _Lucifer_.                    What am I?

    _Cain_. Dost thou love nothing?

    _Lucifer_.                      What does thy God love?            310

    _Cain_. All things, my father says; but I confess
    I see it not in their allotment here.

    _Lucifer_. And, therefore, thou canst not see if _I_ love
    Or no--except some vast and general purpose,
    To which particular things must melt like snows.

    _Cain_. Snows! what are they?

    _Lucifer_.                    Be happier in not knowing
    What thy remoter offspring must encounter;
    But bask beneath the clime which knows no winter.

    _Cain_. But dost thou not love something like thyself?

    _Lucifer_. And dost thou love _thyself_?

    _Cain_.                                 Yes, but love more         320
    What makes my feelings more endurable,
    And is more than myself, because I love it!

    _Lucifer_. Thou lovest it, because 'tis beautiful,
    As was the apple in thy mother's eye;
    And when it ceases to be so, thy love
    Will cease, like any other appetite.[119]

    _Cain_. Cease to be beautiful! how can that be?

    _Lucifer_. With time.

    _Cain_.               But time has passed, and hitherto
    Even Adam and my mother both are fair:
    Not fair like Adah and the Seraphim--                              330
    But very fair.

    _Lucifer_.     All that must pass away
    In them and her.

    _Cain_.          I'm sorry for it; but
    Cannot conceive my love for her the less:
    And when her beauty disappears, methinks
    He who creates all beauty will lose more
    Than me in seeing perish such a work.

    _Lucifer_. I pity thee who lovest what must perish.

    _Cain_. And I thee who lov'st nothing.

    _Lucifer_.                             And thy brother--
    Sits he not near thy heart?

    _Cain_.                    Why should he not?

    _Lucifer_. Thy father loves him well--so does thy God.             340

    _Cain_. And so do I.

    _Lucifer_.           'Tis well and meekly done.

    _Cain_. Meekly!

    _Lucifer_.      He is the second born of flesh,
    And is his mother's favourite.

    _Cain_.                        Let him keep
    Her favour, since the Serpent was the first
    To win it.

    _Lucifer_. And his father's?

    _Cain_.                      What is that
    To me? should I not love that which all love?

    _Lucifer_. And the Jehovah--the indulgent Lord,
    And bounteous planter of barred Paradise--
    He, too, looks smilingly on Abel.

    _Cain_.                           I
    Ne'er saw him, and I know not if he smiles.                        350

    _Lucifer_. But you have seen his angels.

    _Cain_.                                    Rarely.

    _Lucifer_.                                        But
    Sufficiently to see they love your brother:
    _His_ sacrifices are acceptable.

    _Cain_. So be they! wherefore speak to me of this?

    _Lucifer_. Because thou hast thought of this ere now.

    _Cain_.                                               And if
    I _have_ thought, why recall a thought that----
      (_he pauses as agitated_)--Spirit!
    _Here_ we are in _thy_ world; speak not of _mine_.
    Thou hast shown me wonders: thou hast shown me those
    Mighty Pre-Adamites who walked the earth
    Of which ours is the wreck: thou hast pointed out                  360
    Myriads of starry worlds, of which our own
    Is the dim and remote companion, in
    Infinity of life: thou hast shown me shadows
    Of that existence with the dreaded name
    Which my sire brought us--Death;[cj] thou hast shown me much
    But not all: show me where Jehovah dwells,
    In his especial Paradise--or _thine_:
    Where is it?

    _Lucifer_.     _Here_, and o'er all space.

    _Cain_.                                    But ye
    Have some allotted dwelling--as all things;
    Clay has its earth, and other worlds their tenants;                370
    All temporary breathing creatures their
    Peculiar element; and things which have
    Long ceased to breathe _our_ breath, have theirs, thou say'st;
    And the Jehovah and thyself have thine--
    Ye do not dwell together?

    _Lucifer_.                No, we reign
    Together; but our dwellings are asunder.

    _Cain_. Would there were only one of ye! perchance
    An unity of purpose might make union
    In elements which seem now jarred in storms.
    How came ye, being Spirits wise and infinite,                      380
    To separate? Are ye not as brethren in
    Your essence--and your nature, and your glory?

    _Lucifer_. Art not thou Abel's brother?

    _Cain_.                                 We are brethren,
    And so we shall remain; but were it not so,
    Is spirit like to flesh? can it fall out--
    Infinity with Immortality?
    Jarring and turning space to misery--
    For what?

    _Lucifer_. To reign.

    _Cain_.              Did ye not tell me that
    Ye are both eternal?

    _Lucifer_.           Yea!


    _Cain_.                  And what I have seen--
    Yon blue immensity, is boundless?

    _Lucifer_.                        Aye.                             390
    _Cain_. And cannot ye both _reign_, then?--is there not
    Enough?--why should ye differ?

    _Lucifer_.                     We _both_ reign.

    _Cain_. But one of you makes evil.

    _Lucifer_.                         Which?

    _Cain_.                                  Thou! for
    If thou canst do man good, why dost thou not?

    _Lucifer_. And why not he who made? _I_ made ye not;
    Ye are _his_ creatures, and not mine.

    _Cain_.                              Then leave us
    _His_ creatures, as thou say'st we are, or show me
    Thy dwelling, or _his_ dwelling.

    _Lucifer_.                      I could show thee
    Both; but the time will come thou shalt see one
    Of them for evermore.[120]

    _Cain_.                And why not now?                            400

    _Lucifer_. Thy human mind hath scarcely grasp to gather
    The little I have shown thee into calm
    And clear thought: and _thou_ wouldst go on aspiring
    To the great double Mysteries! the _two Principles_![121]
    And gaze upon them on their secret thrones!
    Dust! limit thy ambition; for to see
    Either of these would be for thee to perish!

    _Cain_. And let me perish, so I see them!

    _Lucifer_.                                There
    The son of her who snatched the apple spake!
    But thou wouldst only perish, and not see them;                    410
    That sight is for the other state.

    _Cain_.                            Of Death?

    _Lucifer_. That is the prelude.

    _Cain_.                         Then I dread it less,
    Now that I know it leads to something definite.

    _Lucifer_. And now I will convey thee to thy world,
    Where thou shall multiply the race of Adam,
    Eat, drink, toil, tremble, laugh, weep, sleep--and die!

    _Cain_. And to what end have I beheld these things
    Which thou hast shown me?

    _Lucifer_.                Didst thou not require
    Knowledge? And have I not, in what I showed,
    Taught thee to know thyself?

    _Cain_.                      Alas! I seem                          420
    Nothing.[122]

    _Lucifer_. And this should be the human sum
    Of knowledge, to know mortal nature's nothingness;
    Bequeath that science to thy children, and
    'Twill spare them many tortures.

    _Cain_.                          Haughty spirit!
    Thou speak'st it proudly; but thyself, though proud,
    Hast a superior.

    _Lucifer_.       No! By heaven, which he
    Holds, and the abyss, and the immensity
    Of worlds and life, which I hold with him--No!
    I have a Victor--true; but no superior.[123]
    Homage he has from all--but none from me:                          430
    I battle it against him, as I battled
    In highest Heaven--through all Eternity,
    And the unfathomable gulfs of Hades,
    And the interminable realms of space,
    And the infinity of endless ages,
    All, all, will I dispute! And world by world,
    And star by star, and universe by universe,
    Shall tremble in the balance, till the great
    Conflict shall cease, if ever it shall cease,
    Which it ne'er shall, till he or I be quenched!                    440
    And what can quench our immortality,
    Or mutual and irrevocable hate?
    He as a conqueror will call the conquered
    _Evil_; but what will be the _Good_ he gives?
    Were I the victor, _his_ works would be deemed
    The only evil ones. And you, ye new
    And scarce-born mortals, what have been his gifts
    To you already, in your little world?

    _Cain_. But few; and some of those but bitter.

    _Lucifer_.                                     Back
    With me, then, to thine earth, and try the rest                    450
    Of his celestial boons to you and yours.
    Evil and Good are things in their own essence,
    And not made good or evil by the Giver;
    But if he gives you good--so call him; if
    Evil springs from _him_, do not name it _mine_,
    Till ye know better its true fount; and judge
    Not by words, though of Spirits, but the fruits
    Of your existence, such as it must be.
    _One good_ gift has the fatal apple given,--
    Your _reason_:--let it not be overswayed                           460
    By tyrannous threats to force you into faith
    'Gainst all external sense and inward feeling:
    Think and endure,--and form an inner world
    In your own bosom--where the outward fails;
    So shall you nearer be the spiritual
    Nature, and war triumphant with your own.
                                                        [_They disappear_.




                                 ACT III.


              SCENE I.--_The Earth, near Eden, as in Act I_.

                         _Enter_ CAIN _and_ ADAH.

    _Adah_. Hush! tread softly, Cain!

    _Cain_.                           I will--but wherefore?

    _Adah_. Our little Enoch sleeps upon yon bed
    Of leaves, beneath the cypress.

    _Cain_.                         Cypress! 'tis
    A gloomy tree, which looks as if it mourned
    O'er what it shadows; wherefore didst thou choose it
    For our child's canopy?

    _Adah_.                 Because its branches
    Shut out the sun like night, and therefore seemed
    Fitting to shadow slumber.

    _Cain_.                    Aye, the last--
    And longest; but no matter--lead me to him.
                                               [_They go up to the child_.
    How lovely he appears! his little cheeks,                           10
    In their pure incarnation,[124] vying with
    The rose leaves strewn beneath them.

    _Adah_.                              And his lips, too,
    How beautifully parted! No; you shall not
    Kiss him, at least not now: he will awake soon--
    His hour of mid-day rest is nearly over;
    But it were pity to disturb him till
    'Tis closed.

    _Cain_.     You have said well; I will contain
    My heart till then. He smiles, and sleeps!--sleep on,
    And smile, thou little, young inheritor
    Of a world scarce less young: sleep on, and smile!                  20
    Thine are the hours and days when both are cheering
    And innocent! _thou_ hast not plucked the fruit--
    Thou know'st not thou art naked! Must the time
    Come thou shalt be amerced for sins unknown,
    Which were not thine nor mine? But now sleep on!
    His cheeks are reddening into deeper smiles,
    And shining lids are trembling o'er his long
    Lashes,[125] dark as the cypress which waves o'er them;
    Half open, from beneath them the clear blue
    Laughs out, although in slumber. He must dream--                    30
    Of what? Of Paradise!--Aye! dream of it,
    My disinherited boy! 'Tis but a dream;
    For never more thyself, thy sons, nor fathers,
    Shall walk in that forbidden place of joy!

    _Adah_. Dear Cain! Nay, do not whisper o'er our son
    Such melancholy yearnings o'er the past:
    Why wilt thou always mourn for Paradise?
    Can we not make another?

    _Cain_.                  Where?

    _Adah_.                        Here, or
    Where'er thou wilt: where'er thou art, I feel not
    The want of this so much regretted Eden.                            40
    Have I not thee--our boy--our sire, and brother,
    And Zillah--our sweet sister, and our Eve,
    To whom we owe so much besides our birth?

    _Cain_. Yes--Death, too, is amongst the debts we owe her.

    _Adah_. Cain! that proud Spirit, who withdrew thee hence,
    Hath saddened thine still deeper. I had hoped
    The promised wonders which thou hast beheld,
    Visions, thou say'st, of past and present worlds,
    Would have composed thy mind into the calm
    Of a contented knowledge; but I see                                 50
    Thy guide hath done thee evil: still I thank him,
    And can forgive him all, that he so soon
    Hath given thee back to us.

    _Cain_.                     So soon?

    _Adah_.                            'Tis scarcely
    Two hours since ye departed: two _long_ hours
    To _me_, but only _hours_ upon the sun.

    _Cain_. And yet I have approached that sun, and seen
    Worlds which he once shone on, and never more
    Shall light; and worlds he never lit: methought
    Years had rolled o'er my absence.

    _Adah_.                           Hardly hours.

    _Cain_. The mind then hath capacity of time,                        60
    And measures it by that which it beholds,
    Pleasing or painful[126]; little or almighty.
    I had beheld the immemorial works
    Of endless beings; skirred extinguished worlds;
    And, gazing on eternity, methought
    I had borrowed more by a few drops of ages
    From its immensity: but now I feel
    My littleness again. Well said the Spirit,
    That I was nothing!

    _Adah_.             Wherefore said he so?
    Jehovah said not that.

    _Cain_.                No: _he_ contents him                        70
    With making us the _nothing_ which we are;
    And after flattering dust with glimpses of
    Eden and Immortality, resolves
    It back to dust again--for what?

    _Adah_.                          Thou know'st--
    Even for our parents' error.

    _Cain_.                      What is that
    To us? they sinned, then _let them_ die!

    _Adah_. Thou hast not spoken well, nor is that thought
    Thy own, but of the Spirit who was with thee.
    Would _I_ could die for them, so _they_ might live!

    _Cain_. Why, so say I--provided that one victim                     80
    Might satiate the Insatiable of life,
    And that our little rosy sleeper there
    Might never taste of death nor human sorrow,
    Nor hand it down to those who spring from him.

    _Adah_. How know we that some such atonement one day
    May not redeem our race?

    _Cain_.                   By sacrificing
    The harmless for the guilty? what atonement[127]
    Were there? why, _we_ are innocent: what have we
    Done, that we must be victims for a deed
    Before our birth, or need have victims to                           90
    Atone for this mysterious, nameless sin--
    If it be such a sin to seek for knowledge?

    _Adah_. Alas! thou sinnest now, my Cain: thy words
    Sound impious in mine ears.

    _Cain_.                     Then leave me!

    _Adah_.                                   Never,
    Though thy God left thee.

    _Cain_.                   Say, what have we here?

    _Adah_. Two altars, which our brother Abel made
    During thine absence, whereupon to offer
    A sacrifice to God on thy return.

    _Cain_. And how knew _he_, that _I_ would be so ready
    With the burnt offerings, which he daily brings                    100
    With a meek brow, whose base humility
    Shows more of fear than worship--as a bribe
    To the Creator?

    _Adah_.         Surely, 'tis well done.

    _Cain_. One altar may suffice; _I_ have no offering.

    _Adah_. The fruits of the earth,[128] the early, beautiful,
    Blossom and bud--and bloom of flowers and fruits--
    These are a goodly offering to the Lord,
    Given with a gentle and a contrite spirit.

    _Cain_. I have toiled, and tilled, and sweaten in the sun,
    According to the curse:--must I do more?                           110
    For what should I be gentle? for a war
    With all the elements ere they will yield
    The bread we eat? For what must I be grateful?
    For being dust, and grovelling in the dust,
    Till I return to dust? If I am nothing--
    For nothing shall I be an hypocrite,
    And seem well-pleased with pain? For what should I
    Be contrite? for my father's sin, already
    Expiate with what we all have undergone,
    And to be more than expiated by                                    120
    The ages prophesied, upon our seed.
    Little deems our young blooming sleeper, there,
    The germs of an eternal misery
    To myriads is within him! better 'twere
    I snatched him in his sleep, and dashed him 'gainst
    The rocks, than let him live to----

    _Adah_.                            Oh, my God!
    Touch not the child--my child! _thy_ child! Oh, Cain!

    _Cain_. Fear not! for all the stars, and all the power
    Which sways them, I would not accost yon infant
    With ruder greeting than a father's kiss.                          130

    _Adah_. Then, why so awful in thy speech?

    _Cain_.                                  I said,
    'Twere better that he ceased to live, than give
    Life to so much of sorrow as he must
    Endure, and, harder still, bequeath; but since
    That saying jars you, let us only say--
    'Twere better that he never had been born.

    _Adah_. Oh, do not say so! Where were then the joys,
    The mother's joys of watching, nourishing,
    And loving him? Soft! he awakes. Sweet Enoch!
                                                 [_She goes to the child_.
    Oh, Cain! look on him; see how full of life,                       140
    Of strength, of bloom, of beauty, and of joy--
    How like to me--how like to thee, when gentle--
    For _then_ we are _all_ alike; is't not so, Cain?
    Mother, and sire, and son, our features are
    Reflected in each other; as they are
    In the clear waters, when _they_ are _gentle_, and
    When _thou_ art _gentle_. Love us, then, my Cain!
    And love thyself for our sakes, for we love thee.
    Look! how he laughs and stretches out his arms,
    And opens wide his blue eyes upon thine,                           150
    To hail his father; while his little form
    Flutters as winged with joy. Talk not of pain!
    The childless cherubs well might envy thee
    The pleasures of a parent! Bless him, Cain!
    As yet he hath no words to thank thee, but
    His heart will, and thine own too.

    _Cain_.                            Bless thee, boy!
    If that a mortal blessing may avail thee,
    To save thee from the Serpent's curse!

    _Adah_.                              It shall.
    Surely a father's blessing may avert
    A reptile's subtlety.

    _Cain_.             Of that I doubt;                               160
    But bless him ne'er the less.

    _Adah_.                       Our brother comes.

    _Cain_. Thy brother Abel.

                              _Enter_ ABEL.

    _Abel_.                   Welcome, Cain! My brother,
    The peace of God be on thee!

    _Cain_.                      Abel, hail!

    _Abel_. Our sister tells me that thou hast been wandering,
    In high communion with a Spirit, far
    Beyond our wonted range. Was he of those
    We have seen and spoken with, like to our father?

    _Cain_. No.

    _Abel_.     Why then commune with him? he may be
    A foe to the Most High.

    _Cain_.                 And friend to man.
    Has the Most High been so--if so you term him?                     170

    _Abel_. _Term him!_ your words are strange to-day, my brother.
    My sister Adah, leave us for awhile--
    We mean to sacrifice[129].

    _Adah_.                  Farewell, my Cain;
    But first embrace thy son. May his soft spirit,
    And Abel's pious ministry, recall thee
    To peace and holiness!                 [_Exit_ ADAH, _with her child_.

    _Abel_.                Where hast thou been?

    _Cain_. I know not.

    _Abel_.             Nor what thou hast seen?

    _Cain_.                                     The dead--
    The Immortal--the Unbounded--the Omnipotent--
    The overpowering mysteries of space--
    The innumerable worlds that were and are--                         180
    A whirlwind of such overwhelming things,
    Suns, moons, and earths, upon their loud-voiced spheres
    Singing in thunder round me, as have made me
    Unfit for mortal converse: leave me, Abel.

    _Abel_. Thine eyes are flashing with unnatural light--
    Thy cheek is flushed with an unnatural hue--
    Thy words are fraught with an unnatural sound--
    What may this mean?

    _Cain_.            It means--I pray thee, leave me.

    _Abel_. Not till we have prayed and sacrificed together.

    _Cain_. Abel, I pray thee, sacrifice alone--                       190
    Jehovah loves thee well.

    _Abel_.                  _Both_ well, I hope.

    _Cain_. But thee the better: I care not for that;
    Thou art fitter for his worship than I am;
    Revere him, then--but let it be alone--
    At least, without me.

    _Abel_.               Brother, I should ill
    Deserve the name of our great father's son,
    If, as my elder, I revered thee not,
    And in the worship of our God, called not
    On thee to join me, and precede me in
    Our priesthood--'tis thy place.

    _Cain_.                         But I have ne'er                   200
    Asserted it.

    _Abel_.      The more my grief; I pray thee
    To do so now: thy soul seems labouring in
    Some strong delusion; it will calm thee.

    _Cain_.                                  No;
    Nothing can calm me more. _Calm!_ say I? Never
    Knew I what calm was in the soul, although
    I have seen the elements stilled. My Abel, leave me!
    Or let me leave thee to thy pious purpose.

    _Abel_. Neither; we must perform our task together.
    Spurn me not.

    _Cain_.       If it must be so----well, then,
    What shall I do?

    _Abel_.          Choose one of those two altars.                   210

    _Cain_. Choose for me: they to me are so much turf
    And stone.

    _Abel_.    Choose thou!

    _Cain_.                I have chosen.

    _Abel_.                              'Tis the highest,
    And suits thee, as the elder. Now prepare
    Thine offerings.

    _Cain_.         Where are thine?

    _Abel_.                         Behold them here--
    The firstlings of the flock, and fat thereof--
    A shepherd's humble offering.

    _Cain_.                      I have no flocks;
    I am a tiller of the ground, and must
    Yield what it yieldeth to my toil--its fruit:
                                                     [_He gathers fruits_.
    Behold them in their various bloom and ripeness.
             [_They dress their altars, and kindle aflame upon them_[130].

    _Abel_. My brother, as the elder, offer first                      220
    Thy prayer and thanksgiving with sacrifice.

    _Cain_. No--I am new to this; lead thou the way,
    And I will follow--as I may.

    _Abel_ (_kneeling_).       Oh, God!
    Who made us, and who breathed the breath of life
    Within our nostrils, who hath blessed us,
    And spared, despite our father's sin, to make
    His children all lost, as they might have been,
    Had not thy justice been so tempered with
    The mercy which is thy delight, as to
    Accord a pardon like a Paradise,                                   230
    Compared with our great crimes:--Sole Lord of light!
    Of good, and glory, and eternity!
    Without whom all were evil, and with whom
    Nothing can err, except to some good end
    Of thine omnipotent benevolence!
    Inscrutable, but still to be fulfilled!
    Accept from out thy humble first of shepherds'
    First of the first-born flocks--an offering,
    In itself nothing--as what offering can be
    Aught unto thee?--but yet accept it for                            240
    The thanksgiving of him who spreads it in
    The face of thy high heaven--bowing his own
    Even to the dust, of which he is--in honour
    Of thee, and of thy name, for evermore!

    _Cain_ (_standing erect during this speech_).
    Spirit whate'er or whosoe'er thou art,
    Omnipotent, it may be--and, if good,
    Shown in the exemption of thy deeds from evil;
    Jehovah upon earth! and God in heaven!
    And it may be with other names, because
    Thine attributes seem many, as thy works:--                        250
    If thou must be propitiated with prayers,
    Take them! If thou must be induced with altars,
    And softened with a sacrifice, receive them;
    Two beings here erect them unto thee.
    If thou lov'st blood, the shepherd's shrine, which smokes
    On my right hand, hath shed it for thy service
    In the first of his flock, whose limbs now reek
    In sanguinary incense to thy skies;
    Or, if the sweet and blooming fruits of earth,
    And milder seasons, which the unstained turf                       260
    I spread them on now offers in the face
    Of the broad sun which ripened them, may seem
    Good to thee--inasmuch as they have not
    Suffered in limb or life--and rather form
    A sample of thy works, than supplication
    To look on ours! If a shrine without victim,
    And altar without gore, may win thy favour,
    Look on it! and for him who dresseth it,
    He is--such as thou mad'st him; and seeks nothing
    Which must be won by kneeling: if he's evil[ck],                   270
    Strike him! thou art omnipotent, and may'st--
    For what can he oppose? If he be good,
    Strike him, or spare him, as thou wilt! since all
    Rests upon thee; and Good and Evil seem
    To have no power themselves, save in thy will--
    And whether that be good or ill I know not,
    Not being omnipotent, nor fit to judge
    Omnipotence--but merely to endure
    Its mandate; which thus far I have endured.

                 [_The fire upon the altar of_ ABEL _kindles into a column
                            of the brightest flame, and ascends to heaven;
                               while a whirlwind throws down the altar of_
                                     CAIN, _and scatters the fruits abroad
                                                     upon the earths_[131]

    _Abel_ (_kneeling_).
    Oh, brother, pray! Jehovah's wroth with thee.                      280

    _Cain_. Why so?

    _Abel_.         Thy fruits are scattered on the earth.

    _Cain_. From earth they came, to earth let them return;
    Their seed will bear fresh fruit there ere the summer:
    Thy burnt flesh-offering prospers better; see
    How Heaven licks up the flames, when thick with blood!

    _Abel_. Think not upon my offering's acceptance,
    But make another of thine own--before
    It is too late.

    _Cain_.        I will build no more altars,
    Nor suffer any----

    _Abel_ (_rising_). Cain! what meanest thou?

    _Cain_. To cast down yon vile flatterer of the clouds,             290
    The smoky harbinger of thy dull prayers--
    Thine altar, with its blood of lambs and kids,
    Which fed on milk, to be destroyed in blood.

    _Abel_ (_opposing him_).
    Thou shalt not:--add not impious works to impious
    Words! let that altar stand--'tis hallowed now
    By the immortal pleasure of Jehovah,
    In his acceptance of the victims.

    _Cain_.                         _His_!
    _His pleasure!_ what was his high pleasure in
    The fumes of scorching flesh and smoking blood,
    To the pain of the bleating mothers, which                         300
    Still yearn for their dead offspring? or the pangs
    Of the sad ignorant victims underneath
    Thy pious knife? Give way! this bloody record
    Shall not stand in the sun, to shame creation!

    _Abel_. Brother, give back! thou shalt not touch my altar
    With violence: if that thou wilt adopt it,
    To try another sacrifice, 'tis thine.

    _Cain_. Another sacrifice! Give way, or else
    That sacrifice may be----

    _Abel_.                   What mean'st thou?

    _Cain_.                                     Give--
    Give way!--thy God loves blood!--then look to it:--                310
    Give way, ere he hath _more_!

    _Abel_.                      In _his_ great name,
    I stand between thee and the shrine which hath
    Had his acceptance.

    _Cain_.            If thou lov'st thyself,
    Stand back till I have strewed this turf along
    Its native soil:--else----

    _Abel_ (_opposing him_).   I love God far more
    Than life.

    _Cain_ (_striking him with a brand, on the temples, which
    he snatches from the altar_). Then take thy life unto thy God,
    Since he loves lives.

    _Abel_ (_falls_). What hast thou done--my brother?

    _Cain_. Brother!

    _Abel_.          Oh, God! receive thy servant! and
    Forgive his slayer, for he knew not what
    He did--Cain, give me--give me thy hand; and tell                  320
    Poor Zillah--

    _Cain_ (_after a moment's stupefaction_).
                _My_ hand! 'tis all red, and with----
    What?                          [_A long pause.--Looking slowly round_.
          Where am I? alone! Where's Abel? where
    Cain? Can it be that I am he? My brother,
    Awake!--why liest thou so long on the green earth?
    'Tis not the hour of slumber:--why so pale?
    What hast thou!--thou wert full of life this morn!
    Abel! I pray thee, mock me not! I smote
    Too fiercely, but not fatally. Ah, why
    Wouldst thou oppose me? This is mockery;
    And only done to daunt me:--'twas a blow--                         330
    And but a blow. Stir--stir--nay, only stir!
    Why, so--that's well!--thou breathest! breathe upon me!
    Oh God! Oh God!

    _Abel_ (_very faintly_). What's he who speaks of God?

    _Cain_. Thy murderer.

    _Abel_.               Then may God forgive him! Cain,
    Comfort poor Zillah:--she has but one brother
    Now.                                                     [ABEL _dies_.

    _Cain_. And I none!--Who makes me brotherless?
    His eyes are open! then he is not dead!
    Death is like sleep[132]; and sleep shuts down our lids.
    His lips, too, are apart; why then he breathes;
    And yet I feel it not.--His heart!--his heart!--                   340
    Let me see, doth it beat? methinks----No!--no!
    This is a vision, else I am become
    The native of another and worse world.
    The earth swims round me:--what is this?--'tis wet;
                       [_Puts his hand to his brow, and then looks at it_.
    And yet there are no dews! 'Tis blood--my blood--
    My brother's and my own! and shed by me!
    Then what have I further to do with life,
    Since I have taken life from my own flesh?
    But he can not be dead!--Is silence death?
    No; he will wake; then let me watch by him.                        350
    Life cannot be so slight, as to be quenched
    Thus quickly!--he hath spoken to me since--
    What shall I say to him?--My brother!--No:
    He will not answer to that name; for brethren
    Smite not each other. Yet--yet--speak to me.
    Oh! for a word more of that gentle voice,
    That I may bear to hear my own again!

                             _Enter_ ZILLAH.

    _Zillah_. I heard a heavy sound; what can it be?
    'Tis Cain; and watching by my husband. What
    Dost thou there, brother? Doth he sleep? Oh, Heaven!               360
    What means this paleness, and yon stream?--No, no!
    It is not blood; for who would shed his blood?
    Abel! what's this?--who hath done this? He moves not;
    He breathes not: and his hands drop down from mine
    With stony lifelessness! Ah! cruel Cain!
    Why camest thou not in time to save him from
    This violence? Whatever hath assailed him,
    Thou wert the stronger, and shouldst have stepped in
    Between him and aggression! Father!--Eve!--
    Adah!--come hither! Death is in the world!                         370
                            [_Exit_ ZILLAH, _calling on her Parents, etc._

    _Cain_ (_solus_). And who hath brought him there?--I--who abhor
    The name of Death so deeply, that the thought
    Empoisoned all my life, before I knew
    His aspect--I have led him here, and given
    My brother to his cold and still embrace,
    As if he would not have asserted his
    Inexorable claim without my aid.
    I am awake at last--a dreary dream
    Had maddened me;--but _he_ shall ne'er awake!

                  _Enter_ ADAM, EVE, ADAH, _and_ ZILLAH.

    _Adam_. A voice of woe from Zillah brings me here--                380
    What do I see?--'Tis true!--My son!--my son!
    Woman, behold the Serpent's work, and thine!                [_To_ EVE.

    _Eve_. Oh! speak not of it now: the Serpent's fangs
    Are in my heart! My best beloved, Abel!
    Jehovah! this is punishment beyond
    A mother's sin, to take _him_ from me!

    _Adam_.                                     Who,
    Or what hath done this deed?--speak, Cain, since thou
    Wert present; was it some more hostile angel,
    Who walks not with Jehovah? or some wild
    Brute of the forest?

    _Eve_.               Ah! a livid light                             390
    Breaks through, as from a thunder-cloud! yon brand
    Massy and bloody! snatched from off the altar,
    And black with smoke, and red with----

    _Adam_.                               Speak, my son!
    Speak, and assure us, wretched as we are,
    That we are not more miserable still.

    _Adah_. Speak, Cain! and say it was not _thou_!

    _Eve_.                                          It was!
    I see it now--he hangs his guilty head,
    And covers his ferocious eye with hands
    Incarnadine!

    _Adah_.      Mother, thou dost him wrong--
    Cain! clear thee from this horrible accusal,                       400
    Which grief wrings from our parent.

    _Eve_.                              Hear, Jehovah!
    May the eternal Serpent's curse be on him!
    For he was fitter for his seed than ours.
    May all his days be desolate! May----

    _Adah_.                              Hold!
    Curse him not, mother, for he is thy son--
    Curse him not, mother, for he is my brother,
    And my betrothed.

    _Eve_.           He hath left thee no brother--
    Zillah no husband--me _no son!_ for thus
    I curse him from my sight for evermore!
    All bonds I break between us, as he broke                          410
    That of his nature, _in yon_----Oh Death! Death!
    Why didst thou not take _me_, who first incurred thee?
    Why dost thou not so now?

    _Adam_.                   Eve! let not this,
    Thy natural grief, lead to impiety!
    A heavy doom was long forespoken to us;
    And now that it begins, let it be borne
    In such sort as may show our God, that we
    Are faithful servants to his holy will.

    _Eve_ (_pointing to Cain_).
    _His will!_ the will of yon Incarnate Spirit
    Of Death, whom I have brought upon the earth                       420
    To strew it with the dead. May all the curses
    Of life be on him! and his agonies
    Drive him forth o'er the wilderness, like us
    From Eden, till his children do by him
    As he did by his brother! May the swords
    And wings of fiery Cherubim pursue him
    By day and night--snakes spring up in his path--
    Earth's fruits be ashes in his mouth--the leaves
    On which he lays his head to sleep be strewed
    With scorpions! May his dreams be of his victim!                   430
    His waking a continual dread of Death!
    May the clear rivers turn to blood as he[133]
    Stoops down to stain them with his raging lip!
    May every element shun or change to him!
    May he live in the pangs which others die with!
    And Death itself wax something worse than Death
    To him who first acquainted him with man!
    Hence, fratricide! henceforth that word is _Cain_,
    Through all the coming myriads of mankind,
    Who shall abhor thee, though thou wert their sire!                 440
    May the grass wither from thy feet! the woods
    Deny thee shelter! earth a home! the dust
    A grave! the sun his light! and heaven her God[134]!
                                                              [_Exit_ EVE.

    _Adam_. Cain! get thee forth: we dwell no more together.
    Depart! and leave the dead to me--I am
    Henceforth alone--we never must meet more.

    _Adah_. Oh, part not with him thus, my father: do not
    Add thy deep curse to Eve's upon his head!

    _Adam_. I curse him not: his spirit be his curse.
    Come, Zillah!

    _Zillah_.       I must watch my husband's corse[135].              450

    _Adam_. We will return again, when he is gone
    Who hath provided for us this dread office.
    Come, Zillah!

    _Zillah_.    Yet one kiss on yon pale clay,
    And those lips once so warm--my heart! my heart!
                                    [_Exeunt_ ADAM _and_ ZILLAH _weeping_.

    _Adah_. Cain! thou hast heard, we must go forth. I am ready,
    So shall our children be. I will bear Enoch,
    And you his sister. Ere the sun declines
    Let us depart, nor walk the wilderness
    Under the cloud of night.--Nay, speak to me.
    To _me--thine own_.

    _Cain_.             Leave me!

    _Adah_.                      Why, all have left thee.              460

    _Cain_. And wherefore lingerest thou? Dost thou not fear
    To dwell with one who hath done this?

    _Adah_.                               I fear
    Nothing except to leave thee, much as I
    Shrink from the deed which leaves thee brotherless.
    I must not speak of this--it is between thee
    And the great God.

    _A Voice from within exclaims_. Cain! Cain!

    _Adah_.                    Hear'st thou that voice?

    _The Voice within_. Cain! Cain!

    _Adah_.                        It soundeth like an angel's tone.

                  _Enter the_ ANGEL _of the Lord_.[136]

    _Angel_. Where is thy brother Abel?

    _Cain_.                              Am I then
    My brother's keeper?

    _Angel_.            Cain! what hast thou done?
    The voice of thy slain brother's blood cries out,                  470
    Even from the ground, unto the Lord!--Now art thou
    Cursed from the earth, which opened late her mouth
    To drink thy brother's blood from thy rash hand.
    Henceforth, when thou shalt till the ground, it shall not
    Yield thee her strength; a fugitive shalt thou
    Be from this day, and vagabond on earth!

    _Adah_. This punishment is more than he can bear.
    Behold thou drivest him from the face of earth,
    And from the face of God shall he be hid.
    A fugitive and vagabond on earth,                                  480
    'Twill come to pass, that whoso findeth him
    Shall slay him.

    _Cain_.         Would they could! but who are they
    Shall slay me? Where are these on the lone earth
    As yet unpeopled?

    _Angel_.         Thou hast slain thy brother,
    And who shall warrant thee against thy son?

    _Adah_. Angel of Light! be merciful, nor say
    That this poor aching breast now nourishes
    A murderer in my boy, and of his father.

    _Angel_. Then he would but be what his father is.
    Did not the milk of Eve give nutriment                             490
    To him thou now seest so besmeared with blood?
    The fratricide might well engender parricides.--
    But it shall not be so--the Lord thy God
    And mine commandeth me to set his seal
    On Cain, so that he may go forth in safety.
    Who slayeth Cain, a sevenfold vengeance shall

    _Cain_.                            What
    Wouldst thou with me?

    _Angel_.              To mark upon thy brow[cl]
    Exemption from such deeds as thou hast done.

    _Cain_. No, let me die!

    _Angel_.                It must not be.
                            [_The_ ANGEL _sets the mark on_ CAIN'S _brow_.

    _Cain_.                                It burns                    500
    My brow, but nought to that which is within it!
    Is there more? let me meet it as I may.

    _Angel_. Stern hast thou been and stubborn from the womb,
    As the ground thou must henceforth till; but he
    Thou slew'st was gentle as the flocks he tended.

    _Cain_. After the fall too soon was I begotten;
    Ere yet my mother's mind subsided from
    The Serpent, and my sire still mourned for Eden.
    That which I am, I am; I did not seek
    For life, nor did I make myself; but could I                       510
    With my own death redeem him from the dust--
    And why not so? let him return to day,
    And I lie ghastly! so shall be restored
    By God the life to him he loved; and taken
    From me a being I ne'er loved to bear.

    _Angel_. Who shall heal murder? what is done, is done;
    Go forth! fulfil thy days! and be thy deeds
    Unlike the last!                            [_The_ ANGEL _disappears_.

    _Adah_.          He's gone, let us go forth;
    I hear our little Enoch cry within
    Our bower.

    _Cain_.     Ah! little knows he what he weeps for!                 520
    And I who have shed blood cannot shed tears!
    But the four rivers[137] would not cleanse my soul.
    Think'st thou my boy will bear to look on me?

    _Adah_. If I thought that he would not, I would----

    _Cain_ (_interrupting her_).                        No,
    No more of threats: we have had too many of them:
    Go to our children--I will follow thee.

    _Adah_. I will not leave thee lonely with the dead--
    Let us depart together.

    _Cain_.                Oh! thou dead
    And everlasting witness! whose unsinking
    Blood darkens earth and heaven! what thou _now_ art                530
    I know not! but if _thou_ seest what _I_ am,
    I think thou wilt forgive him, whom his God
    Can ne'er forgive, nor his own soul.--Farewell!
    I must not, dare not touch what I have made thee.
    I, who sprung from the same womb with thee, drained
    The same breast, clasped thee often to my own,
    In fondness brotherly and boyish, I
    Can never meet thee more, nor even dare
    To do that for thee, which thou shouldst have done
    For me--compose thy limbs into their grave--                       540
    The first grave yet dug for mortality.
    But who hath dug that grave? Oh, earth! Oh, earth!
    For all the fruits thou hast rendered to me, I
    Give thee back this.--Now for the wilderness!
                          [ADAH _stoops down and kisses the body of_ ABEL.

    _Adah_. A dreary, and an early doom, my brother,
    Has been thy lot! Of all who mourn for thee,
    I alone must not weep. My office is
    Henceforth to dry up tears, and not to shed them;
    But yet of all who mourn, none mourn like me,
    Not only for thyself, but him who slew thee.                       550
    Now, Cain! I will divide thy burden with thee.

    _Cain_. Eastward from Eden will we take our way;
    'Tis the most desolate, and suits my steps.

    _Adah_. Lead! thou shalt be my guide, and may our God
    Be thine! Now let us carry forth our children.

    _Cain_. And _he_ who lieth there was childless! I
    Have dried the fountain of a gentle race,
    Which might have graced his recent marriage couch,
    And might have tempered this stern blood of mine,
    Uniting with our children Abel's offspring!                        560
    O Abel!

    _Adah_. Peace be with him!

    _Cain_.                    But with _me!_----

FOOTNOTES:

[86] {205}[On the 13th December [1821] Sir Walter received a copy of
Cain, as yet unpublished, from Murray, who had been instructed to ask
whether he had any objection to having the "Mystery" dedicated to him.
He replied in these words--

"Edinburgh, _4th December_, 1821.

"My Dear Sir,--I accept, with feelings of great obligation, the
flattering proposal of Lord Byron to prefix my name to the very grand
and tremendous drama of 'Cain.'[*] I may be partial to it, and you will
allow I have cause; but I do not know that his Muse has ever taken so
lofty a flight amid her former soarings. He has certainly matched Milton
on his own ground. Some part of the language is bold, and may shock one
class of readers, whose line will be adopted by others out of
affectation or envy. But then they must condemn the 'Paradise Lost,' if
they have a mind to be consistent. The fiend-like reasoning and bold
blasphemy of the fiend and of his pupil lead exactly to the point which
was to be expected,--the commission of the first murder, and the ruin
and despair of the perpetrator.

"I do not see how any one can accuse the author himself of Manicheism.
The Devil talks the language of that sect, doubtless; because, not being
able to deny the existence of the Good Principle, he endeavours to exalt
himself--the Evil Principle--to a seeming equality with the Good; but
such arguments, in the mouth of such a being, can only be used to
deceive and to betray. Lord Byron might have made this more evident, by
placing in the mouth of Adam, or of some good and protecting spirit, the
reasons which render the existence of moral evil consistent with the
general benevolence of the Deity. The great key to the mystery is,
perhaps, the imperfection of our own faculties, which see and feel
strongly the partial evils which press upon us, but know too little of
the general system of the universe, to be aware how the existence of
these is to be reconciled with the benevolence of the great Creator.

"To drop these speculations, you have much occasion for some mighty
spirit, like Lord Byron, to come down and trouble the waters; for,
excepting 'The John Bull,'[**] you seem stagnating strangely in London.

"Yours, my dear Sir,

"Very truly,

"WALTER SCOTT.

"To John Murray, Esq."-_Memoirs of the Life of Sir Walter Scott_, by J.
G. Lockhart, Esq., 1838, iii. 92, 93.

[[*] "However, the praise often given to Byron has been so exaggerated
as to provoke, perhaps, a reaction in which he is unduly disparaged. 'As
various in composition as Shakespeare himself, Lord Byron has embraced,'
says Sir Walter Scott, 'every topic of human life, and sounded every
string on the divine harp, from its slightest to its most powerful and
heart-astounding tones.... In the very grand and tremendous drama of
Cain,' etc.... 'And Lord Byron has done all this,' Scott adds, 'while
managing his pen with the careless and negligent ease of a man of
quality.'"--_Poetry of Byron, chosen and arranged by Matthew Arnold_,
1881, p. xiii.

Scott does not add anything of the kind. The comparison with Shakespeare
was written after Byron's death in May, 1824; the appreciation of Cain
in December, 1821 (_vide supra_); while the allusion to "a man of
quality" is to be found in an article contributed to the _Quarterly
Review_ in 1816!]

[[**] The first number of _John Bull_, "For God, the King, and the
People," was published Sunday, December 17, 1820. Theodore Hook was the
editor, and it is supposed that he owed his appointment to the
intervention of Sir Walter Scott. The _raison d'etre_ of _John Bull_ was
to write up George IV., and to write down Queen Caroline. "The national
movement (in favour of the Queen) was arrested; and George IV. had
mainly _John Bull_ to thank for that result."--_A Sketch_, [by J. G.
Lockhart], 1852, p. 45.]]

[87] {207}["Mysteries," or Mystery Plays, were prior to and distinct
from "Moralities." Byron seems to have had some acquaintance with the
archaeology of the drama, but it is not easy to divine the source or
extent of his knowledge. He may have received and read the Roxburghe
reprint of the _Chester Plays_, published in 1818; but it is most
probable that he had read the pages devoted to mystery plays in
_Warton's History of Poetry_, or that he had met with a version of the
_Ludus Coventriae_ (reprinted by J. O. Halliwell Phillipps, in 1841),
printed in Stevens's continuation of Dugdale's _Monasticon_, 1722, i.
139-153. There is a sixteenth-century edition of _Le Mistere du Viel
Testament_, which was reprinted by the Baron James de Rothschild, in
1878 (see for "De la Mort d'Abel et de la Malediction Cayn," pp.
103-113); but it is improbable that it had come under Byron's notice.
For a quotation from an Italian Mystery Play, _vide post_, p. 264; and
for Spanish "Mystery Plays," see _Teatro Completo de Juan del Encina_,
"Proemio," Madrid, 1893, and _History of Spanish Literature_, by George
Ticknor, 1888, i. 257. For instances of the profanity of Mystery Plays,
see the _Towneley Plays_ ("Mactacio Abel," p. 7), first published by the
Surtees Society in 1836, and republished by the Early English Text
Society, 1897, E.S. No. lxxi.]

[88] {208}[For the contention that "the snake was the snake"--no more
(_vide post_, p. 211), see _La Bible enfin Expliquee_, etc.; _OEuvres
Completes de Voltaire_, Paris, 1837, vi. 338, note. "La conversation de
la femme et du serpent n'est point racontee comme une chose surnaturelle
et incroyable, comme un miracle, ou conune une allegorie." See, too,
Bayle (_Hist. and Crit. Dictionary_, 1735, ii. 851, art. "Eve," note A),
who quotes Josephus, Paracelsus, and "some Rabbins," to the effect that
it was an actual serpent which tempted Eve; and compare _Critical
Remarks on the Hebrew Scriptures_, by the Rev. Alexander Geddes, LL.D.,
1800, p. 42.]

[89] [Richard Watson (1737-1816), Bishop of Llandaff, 1782, was
appointed Moderator of the Schools in 1762, and Regius Professor of
Divinity October 31, 1771. According to his own story (_Anecdotes of the
Life of Richard Watson_, 1817, p. 39), "I determined to study nothing
but my Bible.... I had no prejudice against, no predilection for, the
Church of England, but a sincere regard for the _Church of Christ_, and
an insuperable objection to every degree of dogmatical intolerance. I
never troubled myself with answering any arguments which the opponents
in the Divinity Schools brought against the articles of the Church, ...
but I used on such occasions to say to them, holding the New Testament
in my hand, '_En sacrum codicem_! Here is the foundation of truth! Why
do you follow the streams derived from it by the sophistry, or polluted
by the passions, of man?'" It may be conceived that Watson's appeal to
"Scripture" was against the sentence of orthodoxy. His authority as "a
school Divine" is on a par with that of the author of _Cain_, or of an
earlier theologian who "quoted Genesis like a very learned clerk"!]

[90] [Byron breaks through his self-imposed canon with regard to the New
Testament. There are allusions to the doctrine of the Atonement, act i.
sc. I, lines 163-166: act iii. sc. I, lines 85-88; to the descent into
Hades, act i. sc. I, lines 541, 542; and to the miraculous walking on
the Sea of Galilee, act ii. se. i, lines 16-20.]

[91] {209}[The words enclosed in brackets are taken from an original
draft of the Preface.]

[92] [The Manichaeans (the disciples of Mani or Manes, third century
A.D.) held that there were two co-eternal Creators--a God of Darkness
who made the body, and a God of Light who was responsible for the
soul--and that it was the aim and function of the good spirit to rescue
the soul, the spiritual part of man, from the possession and grasp of
the body, which had been created by and was in the possession of the
spirit of evil. St. Augustine passed through a stage of Manicheism, and
in after-life exposed and refuted the heretical tenets which he had
advocated, and with which he was familiar. See, for instance, his
account of the Manichaean heresy "de duplici terra, de regno lucis et
regno tenebrarum" (_Opera_, 1700, viii. 484, c; vide ibid., i. 693, 717;
x. 893, d. etc.).]

[93] [Conan the Jester, a character in the Irish ballads, was "a kind of
Thersites, but brave and daring even to rashness. He had made a vow that
he would never take a blow without returning it; and having ...
descended to the infernal regions, he received a cuff from the
arch-fiend, which he instantly returned, using the expression in the
text ('blow for blow')." Sometimes the proverb is worded thus: "'Claw
for claw, and the devil take the shortest nails,' as Conan said to the
devil."--_Waverley Novels_, 1829 (notes to chap. xxii. of _Waverley_),
i. 241, note 1; see, too, ibid., p. 229.]

[94] [The full title of Warburton's book runs thus: _The Divine Legation
of Moses Demonstrated on the Principles of a Religious Deist; from the
omission of the Doctrine of a Future State of Reward and Punishment in
the Jewish Dispensation_. (See, more particularly (ed. 1741), Vol. II.
pt. ii. bk. v. sect. 5, pp. 449-461, and bk. vi. pp. 569-678.) Compare
the following passage from _Dieu et les Hommes_ (_OEuvres, etc._, de
Voltaire, 1837, vi. 236, chap. xx.): "Notre Warburton s'est epuise a
ramasser dans son fatras de la Divine legation, toutes les preuves que
l'auteur du _Pentateuque_, n'a jamais parle d'une vie a venir, et il n'a
pas eu grande peine; mais il en tire une plaisante conclusion, et digne
d'un esprit aussi faux que le sien."]

[95] {210}[See _Recherches sur les Ossemens Fossiles_, par M. le B^on^
G. Cuvier, Paris, 1821, i., "Discours Preliminaire," pp. iv., vii; and
for the thesis, "Il n'y a point d'os humaines fossiles," see p. lxiv.;
see, too, Cuvier's _Discours sur les revolutions de la surface du
globe_, ed. 1825, p. 282: "Si l'on peut en juger par les differens
ordres d'animaux dont on y trouve les depouilles, ils avaient peut-etre
subi jusqu' a deux ou trois irruptions de la mer." It is curious to note
that Moore thought that Cuvier's book was "a most desolating one in the
conclusions to which it may lead some minds" (_Life_, p. 554).]

[96] {211}[Alfieri's _Abele_ was included in his _Opere inediti_,
published by the Countess of Albany and the Abbe Calma in 1804.

"In a long Preface ... dated April 25, 1796, Alfieri gives a curious
account of the reasons which induced him to call it ... 'Tramelogedy.'
He says that _Abel_ is neither a tragedy, a comedy, a drama, a
tragi-comedy, nor a Greek tragedy, which last would, he thinks, be
correctly described as melo-tragedy. Opera-tragedy would, in his
opinion, be a fitting name for it; but he prefers interpolating the word
'melo' into the middle of the word 'tragedy,' so as not to spoil the
ending, although by so doing he has cut in two ... the root of the
word--?????? [tragos]."--_The Tragedies of Vittorio Alfieri_, edited by
E. A. Bowring, C. B., 1876, ii. 472.

There is no resemblance whatever between Byron's _Cain_ and Alfieri's
_Abele_.]

[97] {216}[Compare--

           " ... his form had not yet lost
    All her original brightness, nor appears
    Less than Arch-angel mind, and the excess
    Of glory obscure."

soul is imprisoned in an alien and evil body. There can be no harmony
between soul and body.]

[100] {219}[Lines 163-166 ("perhaps" ... "sacrifice"), which appear in
the MS., were omitted from the text in the first and all subsequent
editions. In the edition of 1832, etc. (xiv. 27), they are printed as a
variant in a footnote. The present text follows the MS.]

[101] [According to the _Encyclopaedia Biblica_, the word "Abel"
signifies "shepherd" or "herdman." The Massorites give "breath," or
"vanity," as an equivalent.]

[104] {224}[Dr. Arnold, speaking of _Cain_, used to say, "There is
something to me almost awful in meeting suddenly, in the works of such a
man, so great and solemn a truth as is expressed in that speech of
Lucifer, 'He who bows not to God hath bowed to me'" (Stanley's _Life of
Arnold_, ed. 1887, i. 263, note). It may be awful, but it is not
strange. Byron was seldom at a loss for a text, and must have been
familiar with the words, "He that is not with Me is against Me."
Moreover, he was a man of genius!]

[105] {226}["The most common opinion is that a son and daughter were
born together; and they go so far as to tell us the very name of the
daughters. Cain's twin sister was called Calmana (see, too, _Le Mistere

men produces every day, than it would have done in a state of innocence,
it may be answered that this is to compare the Deity to a father who
should suffer his children to break their legs on purpose to show to all
the city his great art in setting their broken bones; or to a king who
should suffer seditions and factions to increase through all his
kingdom, that he might purchase the glory of quelling them.... This is

[121] [Matthew Arnold (_Poetry of Byron_, 1881, p. xxii.) quotes these
lines as an instance of Byron's unknowingness and want of humour. It
cannot be denied that he leaves imbedded in his fabric lumps of unshapen
material, which mar the symmetry of his art. Lucifer's harangue involves
a reference to "hard words ending in _ism_." The _spirit_ of error, not
the Manichaean heresy, should have proceeded out of his lips.]

[122] ["Cain is a proud man: if Lucifer promised him kingdoms, etc., it
would _elate_ him: the object of the Demon is to _depress_ him still
further in his own estimation than he was before, by showing him
infinite things and his own abasement, till he falls into the frame of
mind that leads to the catastrophe, from mere _internal_ irritation,
_not_ premeditation, or envy of Abel (which would have made him
contemptible), but from the rage and fury against the inadequacy of his
state to his conceptions, and which discharges itself rather against
Life, and the author of Life, than the mere living."--Letter to Moore,
November 3, 1821, _Letters_, 1901, v. 470. Here, no doubt, Byron is
speaking _in propria persona_. It was this sense of limitation, of human
nothingness, which provoked an "internal irritation ... a rage and fury
against the inadequacy of his state to his conceptions." His "spirit
beats its mortal bars," not, like Galahad, to be possessed by, but to
possess the Heavenly Vision.]

                   INTRODUCTION TO _HEAVEN AND EARTH_.


_Heaven and Earth_ was begun at Ravenna October 9, 1821. "It occupied
about fourteen days" (Medwin's _Conversations_, 1824, p. 231), and was
forwarded to Murray, November 9, 1821. "You will find _it_," wrote Byron
(_Letters_, 1901, v. 474), "_pious_ enough, I trust--at least some of
the Chorus might have been written by Sternhold and Hopkins themselves
for that, and perhaps for the melody." It was on "a scriptural
subject"--"less speculative than _Cain_, and very pious" (_Letters_,
1901, v. 475; vi. 31). It was to be published, he insists, at the same
time, and, if possible, in the same volume with the "others"
(_Sardanapalus_, etc.), and would serve, so he seems to have _reflected_
("The moment he reflects, he is a child," said Goethe), as an antidote
to the audacities, or, as some would have it, the impieties of _Cain_!

He reckoned without his publisher, who understood the temper of the
public and of the Government, and was naturally loth to awaken any more
"reasonable doubts" in the mind of the Chancellor with regard to whether
a "scriptural drama" was irreverent or profane. The new "Mystery" was
revised by Gifford and printed, but withheld from month to month, till,
at length, "the fire kindled," and, on the last day of October, 1821,
Byron instructed John Hunt to "obtain from Mr. Murray _Werner: a Drama_,
and another dramatic poem called _Heaven and Earth_." It was published
in the second number of _The Liberal_ (pp. 165-206), January 1, 1823.

The same subject, the unequal union of angelic lovers with the daughters
of men, had taken Moore's fancy a year before Byron had begun to
"dramatize the Old Testament." He had designed a long poem, but having
discovered that Byron was at work on the same theme, he resolved to
restrict himself to the production of an "episode," to "give himself the
chance of ... an _heliacal rising_," before he was outshone by the
advent of a greater luminary. Thanks to Murray's scruples, and the
"translation" of MSS. to Hunt, the "episode" took the lead of the
"Mystery" by eight days. The _Loves of the Angels_ (see _Memoirs_, etc.,
1853, iv. 28) was published December 23, 1822. None the less, lyric and
drama were destined to run in double harness. Critics found it
convenient to review the two poems in the same article, and were at
pains to draw a series of more or less pointed and pungent comparisons
between the unwilling though not unwitting rivals.

Wilson, in _Blackwood_, writes, "The first [the _Loves, etc._] is all
glitter and point like a piece of Derbyshire spar, and the other is dark
and massy like a block of marble.... Moore writes with a crow-quill, ...
Byron writes with an eagle's plume;" while Jeffrey, in the _Edinburgh_,
likens Moore to "an _aurora borealis_" and Byron to "an eruption of
Mount Vesuvius"!

There is, indeed, apart from the subject, nothing in common between
Moore's tender and alluring lyric and Byron's gloomy and tumultuous
rhapsody, while contrast is to be sought rather in the poets than in
their poems. The _Loves of the Angels_ is the finished composition of an
accomplished designer of Amoretti, one of the best of his kind, _Heaven
and Earth_ is the rough and unpromising sketch thrown off by a great
master.

Both the one and the other have passed out of the ken of readers of
poetry, but, on the whole, the _Loves of the Angels_ has suffered the
greater injustice. It is opined that there may be possibilities in a
half-forgotten work of Byron, but it is taken for granted that nothing
worthy of attention is to be found in Moore. At the time, however, Moore
scored a success, and Byron hardly escaped a failure. It is to be noted
that within a month of publication (January 18, 1823) Moore was at work
upon a revise for a fifth edition--consulting D'Herbelot "for the
project of turning the poor 'Angels' into Turks," and so "getting rid of
that connection with the Scriptures," which, so the Longmans feared,
would "in the long run be a drag on the popularity of the poem"
(_Memoirs, etc._, 1853, iv. 41). It was no wonder that Murray was
"timorous" with regard to Byron and his "scriptural dramas," when the
Longmans started at the shadow of a scriptural allusion.

Byron, in his innocence, had taken for his motto the verse in _Genesis_
(ch. vi. 2), which records the intermarriage of the "sons of God" with
the "daughters of men." In _Heaven and Earth_ the angels _are_ angels,
members, though erring members, of Jehovah's "thundering choir," and the
daughters of men are the descendants of Cain. The question had come up
for debate owing to the recent appearance of a translation of the _Book
of Enoch_ (by Richard Laurence, LL.D., Oxford, 1821); and Moore, by way
of safeguarding himself against any suspicion of theological
irregularity, is careful to assure his readers ("Preface" to _Loves of
the Angels_, 1823, p. viii. and note, pp. 125-127) that the "sons of
God" were the descendants of Seth, and not beings of a supernatural
order, as a mis-translation by the LXX., assisted by Philo and the
"rhapsodical fictions of the _Book of Enoch_" had induced the ignorant
or the profane to suppose. Nothing is so dangerous as innocence, and a
little more of that _empeiria_ of which Goethe accused him, would have
saved Byron from straying from the path of orthodoxy.

It is impossible to say for certain whether Laurence's translation of
the whole of the _Book of Enoch_ had come under Byron's notice before he
planned his new "Mystery," but it is plain that he was, at any rate,
familiar with the well-known fragment, "Concerning the 'Watchers'" [????
??? ????????? [Peri\ ton E)grego/ron]], which is preserved in the
_Chronographia_ of Georgius Syncellus, and was first printed by J. J.
Scaliger in _Thes. temp. Euseb._ in 1606. In the prophecy of the Deluge
to which he alludes (_vide post_, p. 302, note 1), the names of the
delinquent seraphs (Semjaza and Azazel), and of the archangelic monitor
Raphael, are to be found in the fragment. The germ of _Heaven and Earth_
is not in the _Book of Genesis_, but in the _Book of Enoch_.

Medwin, who prints (_Conversations_, 1824, pp. 234-238) what purports to
be the prose sketch of a Second Part of _Heaven and Earth_ (he says that
Byron compared it to Coleridge's promised conclusion of
_Christabel_--"that, and nothing more!"), detects two other strains in
the composition of the "Mystery," an echo of Goethe's Faust and a
"movement" which recalls the _Eumenides_ of AEschylus. Byron told Murray
that his fourth tragedy was "more lyrical and Greek" than he at first
intended, and there is no doubt that with the _Prometheus Vinctus_ he
was familiar, if not at first hand, at least through the medium of
Shelley's rendering. But apart from the "Greek choruses," which "Shelley
made such a fuss about," Byron was acquainted with, and was not
untouched by, the metrical peculiarities of the _Curse of Kehama_, and
might have traced a kinship between his "angels" and Southey's
"Glendoveers," to say nothing of _their_ collaterals, the "glumms" and
"gawreys" of _Peter Wilkins_ (see notes to Southey's _Curse of Kehama_,
Canto VI., _Poetical Works_, 1838, viii. 231-233).

Goethe was interested in _Heaven and Earth_. "He preferred it," says
Crabb Robinson (_Diary_, 1869, ii. 434), "to all the other serious
poems of Byron.... 'A bishop,' he exclaimed, though it sounded almost
like satire, 'might have written it.' Goethe must have been thinking of
a _German_ bishop!" (For his daughter-in-law's translation of the
speeches of Anah and Aholibamah with their seraph-lovers, see
_Goethe-Jahrbuch_, 1899, pp. 18-21 [Letters, 1901, v. Appendix II. p.
518].)

_Heaven and Earth_ was reviewed by Jeffrey in the _Edinburgh Review_,
February, 1823, vol. 38, pp. 42-48; by Wilson in _Blackwood's Edinburgh
Magazine_, January, 1823, vol. xiii. pp. 71, 72; and in the _New Monthly
Magazine_, N.S., 1823, vol. 7, pp. 353-358.

          SCENE I.--_A woody and mountainous district near Mount
                        Ararat.--Time, midnight_.

                   _Enter_ ANAH _and_ AHOLIBAMAH.[138]

    _Anah_. OUR father sleeps: it is the hour when they
    Who love us are accustomed to descend
    Through the deep clouds o'er rocky Ararat:--
    How my heart beats!

    _Aho._               Let us proceed upon
    Our invocation.

    _Anah_.         But the stars are hidden.
    I tremble.

    _Aho._     So do I, but not with fear
    Of aught save their delay.

    _Anah_.                    My sister, though
    I love Azaziel more than----oh, too much!
    What was I going to say? my heart grows impious.

    _Aho._ And where is the impiety of loving                           10
    Celestial natures?

    _Anah_.            But, Aholibamah,
    I love our God less since his angel loved me:
    This cannot be of good; and though I know not
    That I do wrong, I feel a thousand fears
    Which are not ominous of right.

    _Aho._                          Then wed thee
    Unto some son of clay, and toil and spin!
    There's Japhet loves thee well, hath loved thee long:
    Marry, and bring forth dust!

    _Anah_.                      I should have loved
    Azaziel not less were he mortal; yet
    I am glad he is not. I cannot outlive him.                          20
    And when I think that his immortal wings
    Will one day hover o'er the sepulchre
    Of the poor child of clay[139] which so adored him,
    As he adores the Highest, death becomes
    Less terrible; but yet I pity him:
    His grief will be of ages, or at least
    Mine would be such for him, were I the Seraph,
    And he the perishable.

    _Aho._                 Rather say,
    That he will single forth some other daughter
    Of earth, and love her as he once loved Anah.                       30

    _Anah_. And if it should be so, and she loved him,
    Better thus than that he should weep for me.

    _Aho._ If I thought thus of Samiasa's love,
    All Seraph as he is, I'd spurn him from me.
    But to our invocation!--'Tis the hour.

    _Anah_.
                    Seraph!
                 From thy sphere!
      Whatever star contain thy glory;
        In the eternal depths of heaven
        Albeit thou watchest with "the seven,"[140]                     40
      Though through space infinite and hoary
        Before thy bright wings worlds be driven,
                       Yet hear!
      Oh! think of her who holds thee dear!
        And though she nothing is to thee,
      Yet think that thou art all to her.
        Thou canst not tell,--and never be
        Such pangs decreed to aught save me,--
          The bitterness of tears.
          Eternity is in thine years,                                   50
      Unborn, undying beauty in thine eyes;
      With me thou canst not sympathise,
        Except in love, and there thou must
        Acknowledge that more loving dust
      Ne'er wept beneath the skies.
      Thou walk'st thy many worlds, thou see'st
        The face of him who made thee great,
      As he hath made me of the least
        Of those cast out from Eden's gate:
                  Yet, Seraph dear!                                     60
                      Oh hear!
      For thou hast loved me, and I would not die
        Until I know what I must die in knowing,
      That thou forget'st in thine eternity
        Her whose heart Death could not keep from o'er-flowing
      For thee, immortal essence as thou art!
        Great is their love who love in sin and fear;
      And such, I feel, are waging in my heart
      A war unworthy: to an Adamite
        Forgive, my Seraph! that such thoughts appear,                  70
          For sorrow is our element;
                     Delight
      An Eden kept afar from sight,
          Though sometimes with our visions blent.
                  The hour is near
      Which tells me we are not abandoned quite.--
                   Appear! Appear!
                      Seraph!
          My own Azaziel! be but here,
      And leave the stars to their own light!                           80

    _Aho._
                   Samiasa!
                   Wheresoe'er
          Thou rulest in the upper air--
          Or warring with the spirits who may dare
                  Dispute with him
        Who made all empires, empire; or recalling
      Some wandering star, which shoots through the abyss,
        Whose tenants dying, while their world is falling,
      Share the dim destiny of clay in this;
        Or joining with the inferior cherubim,                          90
        Thou deignest to partake their hymn--
                   Samiasa!
      I call thee, I await thee, and I love thee.
        Many may worship thee, that will I not:
      If that thy spirit down to mine may move thee,
        Descend and share my lot!
        Though I be formed of clay,
          And thou of beams
        More bright than those of day
          On Eden's streams,                                           100
        Thine immortality can not repay
          With love more warm than mine
        My love. There is a ray
          In me, which, though forbidden yet to shine,
          I feel was lighted at thy God's and thine.
        It may be hidden long: death and decay
          Our mother Eve bequeathed us--but my heart
        Defies it: though this life must pass away,
          Is _that_ a cause for thee and me to part?
        Thou art immortal--so am I: I feel--                           110
          I feel my immortality o'ersweep
        All pains, all tears, all fears, and peal,
          Like the eternal thunders of the deep,
        Into my ears this truth--"Thou liv'st for ever!"
            But if it be in joy
        I know not, nor would know;
      That secret rests with the Almighty giver,
        Who folds in clouds the fonts of bliss and woe.
            But thee and me he never can destroy;
        Change us he may, but not o'erwhelm; we are                    120
        Of as eternal essence, and must war
        With him if he will war with us; with _thee_
          I can share all things, even immortal sorrow;
        For thou hast ventured to share life with _me_,
        And shall _I_ shrink from thine eternity?
          No! though the serpent's sting should pierce me thorough,
        And thou thyself wert like the serpent, coil
          Around me still! and I will smile,
                And curse thee not; but hold
              Thee in as warm a fold                                   130
              As----but descend, and prove
              A mortal's love
      For an immortal. If the skies contain
      More joy than thou canst give and take, remain!

    _Anah_. Sister! sister! I view them winging
    Their bright way through the parted night.

    _Aho._ The clouds from off their pinions flinging,
    As though they bore to-morrow's light.

    _Anah_. But if our father see the sight!

    _Aho._ He would but deem it was the moon                           140
    Rising unto some sorcerer's tune
    An hour too soon.[141]

    _Anah_. They come! _he_ comes!--Azaziel!

    _Aho._                                   Haste
    To meet them! Oh! for wings to bear
    My spirit, while they hover there,
            To Samiasa's breast!

    _Anah_. Lo! they have kindled all the west,
    Like a returning sunset;--lo!
            On Ararat's late secret crest
    A mild and many-coloured bow,                                      150
    The remnant of their flashing path,
    Now shines! and now, behold! it hath
    Returned to night, as rippling foam,
      Which the Leviathan hath lashed
    From his unfathomable home,
    When sporting on the face of the calm deep,
      Subsides soon after he again hath dashed
    Down, down, to where the Ocean's fountains sleep.

    _Aho._ They have touched earth! Samiasa!

    _Anah_.                                 My Azaziel!
                                                                [_Exeunt_.


                  SCENE II.--_Enter_ IRAD _and_ JAPHET.

    _Irad_. Despond not: wherefore wilt thou wander thus
    To add thy silence to the silent night,
    And lift thy tearful eye unto the stars?
    They cannot aid thee.

    _Japh._               But they soothe me--now
    Perhaps she looks upon them as I look.
    Methinks a being that is beautiful
    Becometh more so as it looks on beauty,
    The eternal beauty of undying things.
    Oh, Anah!

    _Irad_.    But she loves thee not.

    _Japh._                           Alas!

    _Irad_. And proud Aholibamah spurns me also.                        10

    _Japh._ I feel for thee too.

    _Irad_.                      Let her keep her pride,
    Mine hath enabled me to bear her scorn:
    It may be, time too will avenge it.

    _Japh._                            Canst thou
    Find joy in such a thought?

    _Irad_.                     Nor joy nor sorrow.
    I loved her well; I would have loved her better,
    Had love been met with love: as 'tis, I leave her
    To brighter destinies, if so she deems them.

    _Japh._ What destinies?

    _Irad_.                 I have some cause to think
    She loves another.

    _Japh._             Anah!

    _Irad_.                  No; her sister.

    _Japh._ What other?

    _Irad_.             That I know not; but her air,                   20
    If not her words, tells me she loves another.

    _Japh._ Aye, but not Anah: she but loves her God.

    _Irad_. Whate'er she loveth, so she loves thee not,
    What can it profit thee?

    _Japh._                  True, nothing; but
    I love.

    _Irad_. And so did I.

    _Japh._               And now thou lov'st not,
    Or think'st thou lov'st not, art thou happier?

    _Irad_.                                       Yes.

    _Japh._ I pity thee.

    _Irad_.              Me! why?

    _Japh._                      For being happy,
    Deprived of that which makes my misery.

    _Irad_. I take thy taunt as part of thy distemper,
    And would not feel as thou dost for more shekels                    30
    Than all our father's herds would bring, if weighed
    Against the metal of the sons of Cain--[142]
    The yellow dust they try to barter with us,
    As if such useless and discoloured trash,
    The refuse of the earth, could be received
    For milk, and wool, and flesh, and fruits, and all
    Our flocks and wilderness afford.--Go, Japhet,
    Sigh to the stars, as wolves howl to the moon--
    I must back to my rest.

    _Japh._                  And so would I
    If I could rest.

    _Irad_.          Thou wilt not to our tents then?                   40

    _Japh._ No, Irad; I will to the cavern,[143] whose
    Mouth they say opens from the internal world,
    To let the inner spirits of the earth
    Forth when they walk its surface.

    _Irad_.                            Wherefore so?
    What wouldst thou there?

    _Japh._                   Soothe further my sad spirit
    With gloom as sad: it is a hopeless spot,
    And I am hopeless.

    _Irad_.            But 'tis dangerous;
    Strange sounds and sights have peopled it with terrors.
    I must go with thee.

    _Japh._               Irad, no; believe me
    I feel no evil thought, and fear no evil.                           50

    _Irad_. But evil things will be thy foe the more
    As not being of them: turn thy steps aside,
    Or let mine be with thine.

    _Japh._                    No, neither, Irad;
    I must proceed alone.

    _Irad_.                Then peace be with thee!
                                                             [_Exit_ IRAD.

    _Japh._ (_solus_).
    Peace! I have sought it where it should be found,
    In love--with love, too, which perhaps deserved it;
    And, in its stead, a heaviness of heart,
    A weakness of the spirit, listless days,
    And nights inexorable to sweet sleep
    Have come upon me. Peace! what peace? the calm                      60
    Of desolation, and the stillness of
    The untrodden forest, only broken by
    The sweeping tempest through its groaning boughs;
    Such is the sullen or the fitful state
    Of my mind overworn. The Earth's grown wicked,
    And many signs and portents have proclaimed
    A change at hand, and an o'erwhelming doom
    To perishable beings. Oh, my Anah!
    When the dread hour denounced shall open wide
    The fountains of the deep, how mightest thou                        70
    Have lain within this bosom, folded from
    The elements; this bosom, which in vain
    Hath beat for thee, and then will beat more vainly,
    While thine--Oh, God! at least remit to her
    Thy wrath! for she is pure amidst the failing
    As a star in the clouds, which cannot quench,
    Although they obscure it for an hour. My Anah!
    How would I have adored thee, but thou wouldst not;
    And still would I redeem thee--see thee live
    When Ocean is earth's grave, and, unopposed                         80
    By rock or shallow, the Leviathan,
    Lord of the shoreless sea and watery world,
    Shall wonder at his boundlessness of realm.            [_Exit_ JAPHET.

                          _Enter_ NOAH _and_ SHEM.

    _Noah_. Where is thy brother Japhet?

    _Shem_.                              He went forth,
    According to his wont, to meet with Irad,
    He said; but, as I fear, to bend his steps
    Towards Anah's tents, round which he hovers nightly,
    Like a dove round and round its pillaged nest;
    Or else he walks the wild up to the cavern
    Which opens to the heart of Ararat.                                 90

    _Noah_. What doth he there? It is an evil spot
    Upon an earth all evil; for things worse
    Than even wicked men resort there: he
    Still loves this daughter of a fated race,
    Although he could not wed her if she loved him,
    And that she doth not. Oh, the unhappy hearts
    Of men! that one of my blood, knowing well
    The destiny and evil of these days,
    And that the hour approacheth, should indulge
    In such forbidden yearnings! Lead the way;                         100
    He must be sought for!

    _Shem_.                 Go not forward, father:
    I will seek Japhet.

    _Noah_.              Do not fear for me:
    All evil things are powerless on the man
    Selected by Jehovah.--Let us on.

    _Shem_. To the tents of the father of the sisters?

    _Noah_. No; to the cavern of the Caucasus.
                                               [_Exeunt_ NOAH _and_ SHEM.


        SCENE III.--_The mountains.--A cavern,[144] and the rocks
                     of Caucasus_.

    _Japh._ (_solus_). Ye wilds, that look eternal; and thou cave,
    Which seem'st unfathomable; and ye mountains,
    So varied and so terrible in beauty;
    Here, in your rugged majesty of rocks
    And toppling trees that twine their roots with stone[145]
    In perpendicular places, where the foot
    Of man would tremble, could he reach them--yes,
    Ye look eternal! Yet, in a few days,
    Perhaps even hours, ye will be changed, rent, hurled
    Before the mass of waters; and yon cave,                            10
    Which seems to lead into a lower world,
    Shall have its depths searched by the sweeping wave,
    And dolphins gambol in the lion's den!
    And man----Oh, men! my fellow-beings! Who
    Shall weep above your universal grave,
    Save I? Who shall be left to weep? My kinsmen,
    Alas! what am I better than ye are,
    That I must live beyond ye? Where shall be
    The pleasant places where I thought of Anah
    While I had hope? or the more savage haunts,                        20
    Scarce less beloved, where I despaired for her?
    And can it be!--Shall yon exulting peak,
    Whose glittering top is like a distant star,
    Lie low beneath the boiling of the deep?
    No more to have the morning sun break forth,
    And scatter back the mists in floating folds
    From its tremendous brow? no more to have
    Day's broad orb drop behind its head at even,
    Leaving it with a crown of many hues?
    No more to be the beacon of the world,                              30
    For angels to alight on, as the spot
    Nearest the stars? And can those words "_no more_"
    Be meant for thee, for all things, save for us,
    And the predestined creeping things reserved
    By my sire to Jehovah's bidding? May
    _He_ preserve _them_, and I _not_ have the power
    To snatch the loveliest of earth's daughters from
    A doom which even some serpent, with his mate,
    Shall 'scape to save his kind to be prolonged,
    To hiss and sting through some emerging world,                      40
    Reeking and dank from out the slime, whose ooze
    Shall slumber o'er the wreck of this, until
    The salt morass subside into a sphere
    Beneath the sun, and be the monument,
    The sole and undistinguished sepulchre,
    Of yet quick myriads of all life? How much
    Breath will be stilled at once! All beauteous world!
    So young, so marked out for destruction, I
    With a cleft heart look on thee day by day,
    And night by night, thy numbered days and nights.                   50
    I cannot save thee, cannot save even her
    Whose love had made me love thee more; but as
    A portion of thy dust, I cannot think
    Upon thy coming doom without a feeling
    Such as--Oh God! and canst thou--                        [_He pauses_.

                   [_A rushing sound from the cavern is heard, and shouts
                          of laughter--afterwards a Spirit passes_.

    _Japh._                             In the name
    Of the Most High, what art thou?

    _Spirit_ (_laughs_).             Ha! ha! ha![146]

    _Japh._ By all that earth holds holiest, speak!

    _Spirit_ (_laughs_).                           Ha! ha!

    _Japh._ By the approaching deluge! by the earth
    Which will be strangled by the ocean! by
    The deep which will lay open all her fountains!                     60
    The heaven which will convert her clouds to seas,
    And the Omnipotent who makes and crushes!
    Thou unknown, terrible, and indistinct,
    Yet awful Thing of Shadows, speak to me!
    Why dost thou laugh that horrid laugh?

    _Spirit_.                             Why weep'st thou?

    _Japh._ For earth and all her children.

    _Spirit_.                              Ha! ha! ha!
                                                       [_Spirit vanishes_.

    _Japh._ How the fiend mocks the tortures of a world,
    The coming desolation of an orb,
    On which the sun shall rise and warm no life!
    How the earth sleeps! and all that in it is                         70
    Sleep too upon the very eve of death!
    Why should they wake to meet it? What are here,
    Which look like death in life, and speak like things
    Born ere this dying world? They come like clouds!
                                  [_Various Spirits pass from the cavern_.

    _Spirit_.
                Rejoice!
            The abhorred race
      Which could not keep in Eden their high place,
            But listened to the voice
      Of knowledge without power,
            Are nigh the hour,                                          80
                Of Death!
      Not slow, not single, not by sword, nor sorrow,
        Nor years, nor heart-break, nor Time's sapping motion,
      Shall they drop off. Behold their last to-morrow!
            Earth shall be Ocean!
                And no breath,
      Save of the winds, be on the unbounded wave!
            Angels shall tire their wings, but find no spot:
      Not even a rock from out the liquid grave
            Shall lift its point to save,                               90
      Or show the place where strong Despair hath died,
      After long looking o'er the ocean wide
            For the expected ebb which cometh not:
                All shall be void,
                    Destroyed![147]
      Another element shall be the lord
        Of life, and the abhorred
      Children of dust be quenched; and of each hue
      Of earth nought left but the unbroken blue;
      And of the variegated mountain                                   100
            Shall nought remain
            Unchanged, or of the level plain;
            Cedar and pine shall lift their tops in vain:
      All merged within the universal fountain,
            Man, earth, and fire, shall die,
                And sea and sky
      Look vast and lifeless in the eternal eye.
                Upon the foam
                    Who shall erect a home?

    _Japh._ (_coming forward_).
                    My sire!                                    110
                Earth's seed shall not expire;
                Only the evil shall be put away
                    From day.
            Avaunt! ye exulting demons of the waste!
      Who howl your hideous joy
      When God destroys whom you dare not destroy:
                Hence! haste!
          Back to your inner caves!
          Until the waves
      Shall search you in your secret place,                           120
            And drive your sullen race
      Forth, to be rolled upon the tossing winds,
          In restless wretchedness along all space!

    _Spirit_.
                Son of the saved!
          When thou and thine have braved
            The wide and warring element;
        When the great barrier of the deep is rent,
      Shall thou and thine be good or happy?--No!
      Thy new world and new race shall be of woe--
        Less goodly in their aspect, in their years                    130
              Less than the glorious giants, who
            Yet walk the world in pride,
      The Sons of Heaven by many a mortal bride.
        Thine shall be nothing of the past, save tears!
              And art thou not ashamed
                  Thus to survive,
              And eat, and drink, and wive?
      With a base heart so far subdued and tamed,
      As even to hear this wide destruction named,
      Without such grief and courage, as should rather                 140
        Bid thee await the world-dissolving wave,
      Than seek a shelter with thy favoured father,
        And build thy city o'er the drowned earth's grave?
              Who would outlive their kind,
              Except the base and blind?
                         Mine
                     Hateth thine
        As of a different order in the sphere,
                    But not our own.
      There is not one who hath not left a throne                      150
        Vacant in heaven to dwell in darkness here,
      Rather than see his mates endure alone.
                    Go, wretch! and give
      A life like thine to other wretches--live!
        And when the annihilating waters roar
                    Above what they have done,
        Envy the giant patriarchs then no more,
      And scorn thy sire as the surviving one!
                    Thyself for being his son!

               _Chorus of Spirits issuing from the cavern_.

                    Rejoice!                                           160
            No more the human voice
            Shall vex our joys in middle air
                  With prayer;
                No more
                Shall they adore;
      And we, who ne'er for ages have adored
              The prayer-exacting Lord,
      To whom the omission of a sacrifice
                   Is vice;
      We, we shall view the deep's salt sources poured                 170
      Until one element shall do the work
            Of all in chaos; until they,
            The creatures proud of their poor clay,
      Shall perish, and their bleached bones shall lurk
            In caves, in dens, in clefts of mountains, where
      The deep shall follow to their latest lair;
            Where even the brutes, in their despair,
      Shall cease to prey on man and on each other,
        And the striped tiger shall lie down to die
      Beside the lamb, as though he were his brother;                  180
                 Till all things shall be as they were,
             Silent and uncreated, save the sky:
                    While a brief truce
             Is made with Death, who shall forbear
           The little remnant of the past creation,
         To generate new nations for his use;
           This remnant, floating o'er the undulation
             Of the subsiding deluge, from its slime,
         When the hot sun hath baked the reeking soil
             Into a world, shall give again to Time                    190
             New beings--years, diseases, sorrow, crime--
         With all companionship of hate and toil,
                       Until----

    _Japh._ (_Interrupting them_).
                        The eternal Will
                Shall deign to expound this dream
                Of good and evil; and redeem
                    Unto himself all times, all things;
                    And, gathered under his almighty wings,
                        Abolish Hell!
                And to the expiated Earth
                Restore the beauty of her birth,                       200
                  Her Eden in an endless paradise,
                Where man no more can fall as once he fell,
                And even the very demons shall do well!

    _Spirits_. And when shall take effect this wondrous spell?

    _Japh._ When the Redeemer cometh; first in pain,
                        And then in glory.

    _Spirit_. Meantime still struggle in the mortal chain,
               Till Earth wax hoary;
      War with yourselves, and Hell, and Heaven, in vain,
               Until the clouds look gory                              210
      With the blood reeking from each battle-plain;
      New times, new climes, new arts, new men; but still,
      The same old tears, old crimes, and oldest ill,
      Shall be amongst your race in different forms;
               But the same moral storms
        Shall oversweep the future, as the waves
        In a few hours the glorious giants' graves[148].

                           _Chorus of Spirits_.

                   Brethren, rejoice!
                   Mortal, farewell!
    Hark! hark! already we can hear the voice                          220
          Of growing Ocean's gloomy swell;
        The winds, too, plume their piercing wings;
        The clouds have nearly filled their springs;
    The fountains of the great deep shall be broken,
      And heaven set wide her windows[149]; while mankind
    View, unacknowledged, each tremendous token--
      Still, as they were from the beginning, blind.
        We hear the sound they cannot hear,
        The mustering thunders of the threatening sphere;
          Yet a few hours their coming is delayed;                     230
        Their flashing banners, folded still on high,
                  Yet undisplayed,
        Save to the Spirit's all-pervading eye.
                  Howl! howl! oh Earth!
    Thy death is nearer than thy recent birth;
    Tremble, ye mountains, soon to shrink below
              The Ocean's overflow!
    The wave shall break upon your cliffs; and shells,
      The little shells, of ocean's least things be
    Deposed where now the eagle's offspring dwells[150]--              240
      How shall he shriek o'er the remorseless sea!
    And call his nestlings up with fruitless yell,
    Unanswered, save by the encroaching swell;--
    While man shall long in vain for his broad wings,
      The wings which could not save:--
    Where could he rest them, while the whole space brings
      Nought to his eye beyond the deep, his grave?
               Brethren, rejoice!
      And loudly lift each superhuman voice--
                     All die,                                          250
      Save the slight remnant of Seth's seed--
               The seed of Seth,
      Exempt for future sorrow's sake from death.
            But of the sons of Cain
               None shall remain;
          And all his goodly daughters
      Must lie beneath the desolating waters;
      Or, floating upward, with their long hair laid
      Along the wave, the cruel heaven upbraid,
               Which would not spare                                   260
             Beings even in death so fair.
                 It is decreed,
                    All die!
        And to the universal human cry
      The universal silence shall succeed!
               Fly, brethren, fly!
               But still rejoice!
                    We fell!
                   They fall!
                     So perish all                                     270
    These petty foes of Heaven who shrink from Hell!
                                [_The Spirits disappear, soaring upwards_.

    _Japh._ (_solus_).
    God hath proclaimed the destiny of earth;
    My father's ark of safety hath announced it;
    The very demons shriek it from their caves;
    The scroll[151] of Enoch prophesied it long
    In silent books, which, in their silence, say
    More to the mind than thunder to the ear:
    And yet men listened not, nor listen; but
    Walk darkling to their doom: which, though so nigh,
    Shakes them no more in their dim disbelief,                        280
    Than their last cries shall shake the Almighty purpose,
    Or deaf obedient Ocean, which fulfils it.
    No sign yet hangs its banner in the air;
    The clouds are few, and of their wonted texture;
    The Sun will rise upon the Earth's last day
    As on the fourth day of creation, when
    God said unto him, "Shine!" and he broke forth
    Into the dawn, which lighted not the yet
    Unformed forefather of mankind--but roused
    Before the human orison the earlier                                290
    Made and far sweeter voices of the birds,
    Which in the open firmament of heaven
    Have wings like angels, and like them salute
    Heaven first each day before the Adamites:
    Their matins now draw nigh--the east is kindling--
    And they will sing! and day will break! Both near,
    So near the awful close! For these must drop
    Their outworn pinions on the deep; and day,
    After the bright course of a few brief morrows,--
    Aye, day will rise; but upon what?--a chaos,                       300
    Which was ere day; and which, renewed, makes Time
    Nothing! for, without life, what are the hours?
    No more to dust than is Eternity
    Unto Jehovah, who created both.
    Without him, even Eternity would be
    A void: without man, Time, as made for man,
    Dies with man, and is swallowed in that deep
    Which has no fountain; as his race will be
    Devoured by that which drowns his infant world.--
    What have we here? Shapes of both earth and air?                   310
    No--_all_ of heaven, they are so beautiful.
    I cannot trace their features; but their forms,
    How lovelily they move along the side
    Of the grey mountain, scattering its mist!
    And after the swart savage spirits, whose
    Infernal immortality poured forth
    Their impious hymn of triumph, they shall be
    Welcome as Eden. It may be they come
    To tell me the reprieve of our young world,
    For which I have so often prayed.--They come!                      320
    Anah! oh, God! and with her----

            _Enter_ SAMIASA, AZAZIEL, ANAH, _and_ AHOLIBAMAH.

    _Anah_.                         Japhet!

    _Sam._                                 Lo!
    A son of Adam!

    _Aza._        What doth the earth-born here,
    While all his race are slumbering?

    _Japh._                           Angel! what
    Dost thou on earth when thou should'st be on high?

    _Aza._ Know'st thou not, or forget'st thou, that a part
    Of our great function is to guard thine earth?

    _Japh._ But all good angels have forsaken earth,
    Which is condemned; nay, even the evil fly
    The approaching chaos. Anah! Anah! my
    In vain, and long, and still to be, beloved!                       330
    Why walk'st thou with this Spirit, in those hours
    When no good Spirit longer lights below?

    _Anah_. Japhet, I cannot answer thee; yet, yet
    Forgive me----

    _Japh._       May the Heaven, which soon no more
    Will pardon, do so! for thou art greatly tempted.

    _Aho._ Back to thy tents, insulting son of Noah!
    We know thee not.

    _Japh._          The hour may come when thou
    May'st know me better; and thy sister know
    Me still the same which I have ever been.

    _Sam._ Son of the patriarch, who hath ever been                    340
    Upright before his God, whate'er thy gifts,
    And thy words seem of sorrow, mixed with wrath,
    How have Azaziel, or myself, brought on thee
    Wrong?

    _Japh._ Wrong! the greatest of all wrongs! but, thou
    Say'st well, though she be dust--I did not, could not,
    Deserve her. Farewell, Anah! I have said
    That word so often! but now say it, ne'er
    To be repeated. Angel! or whate'er
    Thou art, or must be soon, hast thou the power
    To save this beautiful--_these_ beautiful                          350
    Children of Cain?

    _Aza._           From what?

    _Japh._                    And is it so,
    That ye too know not? Angels! angels! ye
    Have shared man's sin, and, it may be, now must
    Partake his punishment; or, at the least,
    My sorrow.

    _Sam._ Sorrow! I ne'er thought till now
    To hear an Adamite speak riddles to me.

    _Japh._ And hath not the Most High expounded them?
    Then ye are lost as they are lost.

    _Aho._                            So be it!
    If they love as they are loved, they will not shrink
    More to be mortal, than I would to dare                            360
    An immortality of agonies
    With Samiasa!

    _Anah_.      Sister! sister! speak not
    Thus.

    _Aza._ Fearest thou, my Anah?

    _Anah_.                       Yes, for thee:
    I would resign the greater remnant of
    This little life of mine, before one hour
    Of thine eternity should know a pang.

    _Japh._ It is for _him_, then! for the Seraph thou
    Hast left me! That is nothing, if thou hast not
    Left thy God too! for unions like to these,
    Between a mortal and an immortal, cannot                           370
    Be happy or be hallowed. We are sent
    Upon the earth to toil and die; and they
    Are made to minister on high unto
    The Highest: but if he can _save_ thee, soon
    The hour will come in which celestial aid
    Alone can do so.

    _Anah_.         Ah! he speaks of Death.

    _Sam._ Of death to _us_! and those who are with us!
    But that the man seems full of sorrow, I
    Could smile.

    _Japh._      I grieve not for myself, nor fear.
    I am safe, not for my own deserts, but those                       380
    Of a well-doing sire, who hath been found
    Righteous enough to save his children. Would
    His power was greater of redemption! or
    That by exchanging my own life for hers,
    Who could alone have made mine happy, she,
    The last and loveliest of Cain's race, could share
    The ark which shall receive a remnant of
    The seed of Seth!

    _Aho._            And dost thou think that we,
    With Cain's, the eldest born of Adam's, blood
    Warm in our veins,--strong Cain! who was begotten                  390
    In Paradise[152],--would mingle with Seth's children?
    Seth, the last offspring of old Adam's dotage?
    No, not to save all Earth, were Earth in peril!
    Our race hath always dwelt apart from thine
    From the beginning, and shall do so ever.

    _Japh._ I did not speak to thee, Aholibamah!
    Too much of the forefather whom thou vauntest
    Has come down in that haughty blood which springs
    From him who shed the first, and that a brother's!
    But thou, my Anah! let me call thee mine,                          400
    Albeit thou art not; 'tis a word I cannot
    Part with, although I must from thee. My Anah!
    Thou who dost rather make me dream that Abel
    Had left a daughter, whose pure pious race
    Survived in thee, so much unlike thou art
    The rest of the stem Cainites, save in beauty,
    For all of them are fairest in their favour----

    _Aho._ (_interrupting him_).
    And would'st thou have her like our father's foe
    In mind, in soul? If _I_ partook thy thought,
    And dreamed that aught of _Abel_ was in _her_!--                   410
    Get thee hence, son of Noah; thou makest strife.

    _Japh._ Offspring of Cain, thy father did so!

    _Aho._                                        But
    He slew not Seth: and what hast thou to do
    With other deeds between his God and him?

    _Japh._ Thou speakest well: his God hath judged him, and
    I had not named his deed, but that thyself
    Didst seem to glory in him, nor to shrink
    From what he had done.

    _Aho._                 He was our father's father;
    The eldest born of man, the strongest, bravest,
    And most enduring:--Shall I blush for him                          420
    From whom we had our being? Look upon
    Our race; behold their stature and their beauty,
    Their courage, strength, and length of days----

    _Japh._                                        They are numbered.

    _Aho._ Be it so! but while yet their hours endure,
    I glory in my brethren and our fathers.

    _Japh._ My sire and race but glory in their God,
    Anah! and thou?----

    _Anah_.             Whate'er our God decrees,
    The God of Seth as Cain, I must obey,
    And will endeavour patiently to obey.
    But could I dare to pray in his dread hour                         430
    Of universal vengeance (if such should be),
    It would not be to live, alone exempt
    Of all my house. My sister! oh, my sister!
    What were the world, or other worlds, or all
    The brightest future, without the sweet past--
    Thy love, my father's, all the life, and all
    The things which sprang up with me, like the stars,
    Making my dim existence radiant with
    Soft lights which were not mine? Aholibamah!
    Oh! if there should be mercy--seek it, find it:                    440
    I abhor Death, because that thou must die.

    _Aho._ What, hath this dreamer, with his father's ark,
    The bugbear he hath built to scare the world,
    Shaken _my_ sister? Are _we_ not the loved
    Of Seraphs? and if we were not, must we
    Cling to a son of Noah for our lives?
    Rather than thus----But the enthusiast dreams
    The worst of dreams, the fantasies engendered
    By hopeless love and heated vigils. Who
    Shall shake these solid mountains, this firm earth,                450
    And bid those clouds and waters take a shape
    Distinct from that which we and all our sires
    Have seen them wear on their eternal way?
    Who shall do this?

    _Japh._           He whose one word produced them.

    _Aho._ Who _heard_ that word?

    _Japh._                      The universe, which leaped
    To life before it. Ah! smilest thou still in scorn?
    Turn to thy Seraphs: if they attest it not,
    They are none.

    _Sam._        Aholibamah, own thy God!

    _Aho._ I have ever hailed our Maker, Samiasa,
    As thine, and mine: a God of Love, not Sorrow.                     460

    _Japh._ Alas! what else is Love but Sorrow? Even
    He who made earth in love had soon to grieve
    Above its first and best inhabitants.

    _Aho._ 'Tis said so.

    _Japh._              It is even so.

                         _Enter_ NOAH _and_ SHEM.

    _Noah_.                             Japhet! What
    Dost thou here with these children of the wicked?
    Dread'st thou not to partake their coming doom?

    _Japh._ Father, it cannot be a sin to seek
    To save an earth-born being; and behold,
    These are not of the sinful, since they have
    The fellowship of angels.

    _Noah_.                   These are they, then,                    470
    Who leave the throne of God, to take them wives
    From out the race of Cain; the sons of Heaven,
    Who seek Earth's daughters for their beauty?

    _Aza._                                      Patriarch!
    Thou hast said it.

    _Noah_.            Woe, woe, woe to such communion!
    Has not God made a barrier between Earth
    And Heaven, and limited each, kind to kind?

    _Sam._ Was not man made in high Jehovah's image?
    Did God not love what he had made? And what
    Do we but imitate and emulate
    His love unto created love?

    _Noah_.                    I am                                    480
    But man, and was not made to judge mankind,
    Far less the sons of God; but as our God
    Has deigned to commune with me, and reveal
    _His_ judgments, I reply, that the descent
    Of Seraphs from their everlasting seat
    Unto a perishable and perishing,
    Even on the very _eve_ of _perishing_[153]?--world,
    Cannot be good.

    _Aza._          What! though it were to save?

    _Noah_. Not ye in all your glory can redeem
    What he who made you glorious hath condemned.                      490
    Were your immortal mission safety, 'twould
    Be general, not for two, though beautiful;
    And beautiful they are, but not the less
    Condemned.

    _Japh._    Oh, father! say it not.

    _Noah_.                            Son! son!
    If that thou wouldst avoid their doom, forget
    That they exist: they soon shall cease to be,
    While thou shalt be the sire of a new world,
    And better.

    _Japh._     Let me die with _this_, and _them_!

    _Noah_. Thou _shouldst_ for such a thought, but shalt not: he
    Who _can_, redeems thee.

    _Sam._                    And why him and thee,                    500
    More than what he, thy son, prefers to both?

    _Noah_. Ask him who made thee greater than myself
    And mine, but not less subject to his own
    Almightiness. And lo! his mildest and
    Least to be tempted messenger appears!

                  _Enter_ RAPHAEL[154] _the Archangel_.

    _Raph._
                    Spirits!
            Whose seat is near the throne,
                What do ye here?
        Is thus a Seraph's duty to be shown,
               Now that the hour is near                               510
           When Earth must be alone?
                    Return!
                Adore and burn,
      In glorious homage with the elected "Seven."
                Your place is Heaven.

    _Sam._
                     Raphael!
      The first and fairest of the sons of God,
                How long hath this been law,
      That Earth by angels must be left untrod?
                Earth! which oft saw                                   520
      Jehovah's footsteps not disdain her sod!
          The world he loved, and made
          For love; and oft have we obeyed
      His frequent mission with delighted pinions:
          Adoring him in his least works displayed;
      Watching this youngest star of his dominions;
          And, as the latest birth of his great word,
          Eager to keep it worthy of our Lord.
                Why is thy brow severe?
      And wherefore speak'st thou of destruction near?                 530

    _Raph._
            Had Samiasa and Azaziel been
        In their true place, with the angelic choir,
                    Written in fire
                  They would have seen
                  Jehovah's late decree,
      And not enquired their Maker's breath of me:
                  But ignorance must ever be
                    A part of sin;
      And even the Spirits' knowledge shall grow less
                  As they wax proud within;                            540
      For Blindness is the first-born of Excess.
        When all good angels left the world, ye stayed,
      Stung with strange passions, and debased
        By mortal feelings for a mortal maid:
      But ye are pardoned thus far, and replaced
      With your pure equals. Hence! away! away!
                     Or stay,
      And lose Eternity by that delay!

    _Aza._
            And thou! if Earth be thus forbidden
                    In the decree                                      550
              To us until this moment hidden,
                    Dost thou not err as we
                      In being here?

    _Raph._
      I came to call ye back to your fit sphere,
        In the great name and at the word of God,
      Dear, dearest in themselves, and scarce less dear--
        That which I came to do[155]: till now we trod
      Together the eternal space; together
        Let us still walk the stars[156]. True, Earth must die!
      Her race, returned into her womb, must wither,                   560
        And much which she inherits: but oh! why
        Cannot this Earth be made, or be destroyed,
        Without involving ever some vast void
      In the immortal ranks? immortal still
        In their immeasurable forfeiture.
      Our brother Satan fell; his burning will
        Rather than longer worship dared endure!
        But ye who still are pure!
      Seraphs! less mighty than that mightiest one,--
        Think how he was undone!                                       570
      And think if tempting man can compensate
        For Heaven desired too late?
              Long have I warred,
              Long must I war
          With him who deemed it hard
      To be created, and to acknowledge him
      Who midst the cherubim
        Made him as suns to a dependent star,
      Leaving the archangels at his right hand dim.
          I loved him--beautiful he was: oh, Heaven!                   580
      Save _his_ who made, what beauty and what power
      Was ever like to Satan's! Would the hour
          In which he fell could ever be forgiven!
      The wish is impious: but, oh ye!
      Yet undestroyed, be warned! Eternity
        With him, or with his God, is in your choice:
      He hath not tempted you; he cannot tempt
      The angels, from his further snares exempt:
        But man hath listened to his voice,
      And ye to woman's--beautiful she is,                             590
      The serpent's voice less subtle than her kiss.
      The snake but vanquished dust; but she will draw
      A second host from heaven, to break Heaven's law.
                    Yet, yet, oh fly!
                    Ye cannot die;
                    But they
                    Shall pass away,
      While ye shall fill with shrieks the upper sky
          For perishable clay,
      Whose memory in your immortality                                 600
          Shall long outlast the Sun which gave them day.
      Think how your essence differeth from theirs
      In all but suffering! why partake
      The agony to which they must be heirs--
      Born to be ploughed with years, and sown with cares,
        And reaped by Death, lord of the human soil?
      Even had their days been left to toil their path
      Through time to dust, unshortened by God's wrath,
        Still they are Evil's prey, and Sorrow's spoil.

    _Aho._
                    Let them fly!                                      610
      I hear the voice which says that all must die,
      Sooner than our white-bearded patriarchs died;
                    And that on high
                  An ocean is prepared,
                    While from below
      The deep shall rise to meet Heaven's overflow--
                  Few shall be spared,
      It seems; and, of that few, the race of Cain
      Must lift their eyes to Adam's God in vain.
                  Sister! since it is so,                              620
                And the eternal Lord
              In vain would be implored
          For the remission of one hour of woe,
      Let us resign even what we have adored,
      And meet the wave, as we would meet the sword,
          If not unmoved, yet undismayed,
      And wailing less for us than those who shall
      Survive in mortal or immortal thrall,
          And, when the fatal waters are allayed,
      Weep for the myriads who can weep no more.                       630
      Fly, Seraphs! to your own eternal shore,
      Where winds nor howl, nor waters roar.
            Our portion is to die,
          And yours to live for ever:
        But which is best, a dead Eternity,
      Or living, is but known to the great Giver.
            Obey him, as we shall obey;
        I would not keep this life of mine in clay
            An hour beyond his will;
      Nor see ye lose a portion of his grace,                          640
      For all the mercy which Seth's race
                  Find still.
                      Fly!
        And as your pinions bear ye back to Heaven,
      Think that my love still mounts with thee on high,
                    Samiasa!
      And if I look up with a tearless eye,
        'Tis that an angel's bride disdains to weep,--
        Farewell! Now rise, inexorable deep!

    _Anah_.
                    And must we die?                                   650
                  And must I lose thee too,
                      Azaziel?
                Oh, my heart! my heart!
                  Thy prophecies were true!
                And yet thou wert so happy too!
        The blow, though not unlocked for, falls as new:
                    But yet depart!
                        Ah! why?
            Yet let me not retain thee--fly!
         My pangs can be but brief; but thine would be                 660
         Eternal, if repulsed from Heaven for me.
             Too much already hast thou deigned
                 To one of Adam's race!
      Our doom is sorrow: not to us alone,
        But to the Spirits who have not disdained
      To love us, cometh anguish with disgrace.
      The first who taught us knowledge hath been hurled
        From his once archangelic throne
        Into some unknown world:
             And thou, Azaziel! No--                                   670
             Thou shall not suffer woe
      For me. Away! nor weep!
        Thou canst not weep; but yet
        May'st suffer more, not weeping: then forget
      Her, whom the surges of the all-strangling deep
      Can bring no pang like this. Fly! fly!
      Being gone, 'twill be less difficult to die.

    _Japh._
                Oh say not so!
              Father! and thou, archangel, thou!
        Surely celestial mercy lurks below                             680
      That pure severe serenity of brow:
        Let them not meet this sea without a shore,
        Save in our ark, or let me be no more!

    _Noah_.
          Peace, child of passion, peace!
      If not within thy heart, yet with thy tongue
          Do God no wrong!
      Live as he wills it--die, when he ordains,
      A righteous death, unlike the seed of Cain's.
        Cease, or be sorrowful in silence; cease
      To weary Heaven's ear with thy selfish plaint.                   690
        Wouldst thou have God commit a sin for thee?
                Such would it be
             To alter his intent
      For a mere mortal sorrow. Be a man!
      And bear what Adam's race must bear, and can.

    _Japh._
          Aye, father! but when they are gone,
            And we are all alone,
      Floating upon the azure desert, and
      The depth beneath us hides our own dear land,
        And dearer, silent friends and brethren, all                   700
        Buried in its immeasurable breast,
      Who, who, our tears, our shrieks, shall then command?
        Can we in Desolation's peace have rest?
          Oh God! be thou a God, and spare
            Yet while 'tis time!
          Renew not Adam's fall:
        Mankind were then but twain,
      But they are numerous now as are the waves
            And the tremendous rain,
      Whose drops shall be less thick than would their graves,         710
        Were graves permitted to the seed of Cain.

    _Noah_. Silence, vain boy! each word of thine's a crime.
    Angel! forgive this stripling's fond despair.

    _Raph._ Seraphs! these mortals speak in passion: Ye!
    Who are, or should be, passionless and pure,
    May now return with me.

    _Sam._                  It may not be:
    We have chosen, and will endure.

    _Raph._ Say'st thou?

    _Aza._               He hath said it, and I say, Amen!

    _Raph._
                Again!
          Then from this hour,                                         720
          Shorn as ye are of all celestial power,
      And aliens from your God,
                Farewell!

    _Japh._             Alas! where shall they dwell?
    Hark, hark! Deep sounds, and deeper still,
      Are howling from the mountain's bosom:
    There's not a breath of wind upon the hill,
      Yet quivers every leaf, and drops each blossom:
    Earth groans as if beneath a heavy load.

    _Noah_. Hark, hark! the sea-birds cry!                             730
      In clouds they overspread the lurid sky,
    And hover round the mountain, where before
      Never a white wing, wetted by the wave,
          Yet dared to soar,
      Even when the waters waxed too fierce to brave.
          Soon it shall be their only shore,
          And then, no more!

    _Japh._ The sun! the sun[157]!
    He riseth, but his better light is gone;
            And a black circle, bound                                  740
            His glaring disk around,
    Proclaims Earth's last of summer days hath shone!
          The clouds return into the hues of night,
    Save where their brazen-coloured edges streak
    The verge where brighter morns were wont to break.

    _Noah_. And lo! yon flash of light,
    The distant thunder's harbinger, appears!
          It cometh! hence, away!
    Leave to the elements their evil prey!
    Hence to where our all-hallowed ark uprears                        750
              Its safe and wreckless sides!

    _Japh._ Oh, father, stay!
    Leave not my Anah to the swallowing tides!

    _Noah_. Must we not leave all life to such? Begone!

    _Japh._                 Not I.

    _Noah_.                 Then die
                           With them!
    How darest thou look on that prophetic sky,
    And seek to save what all things now condemn,
            In overwhelming unison                                     760
                  With just Jehovah's wrath!

    _Japh._ Can rage and justice join in the same path?

    _Noah_. Blasphemer! darest thou murmur even now!

    _Raph._ Patriarch, be still a father! smooth thy brow:
    Thy son, despite his folly, shall not sink:
    He knows not what he says, yet shall not drink
      With sobs the salt foam of the swelling waters;
    But be, when passion passeth, good as thou,
      Nor perish like Heaven's children with man's daughters.

    _Aho._ The tempest cometh; heaven and earth unite                  770
        For the annihilation of all life.
        Unequal is the strife
    Between our strength and the Eternal Might!

    _Sam._ But ours is with thee; we will bear ye far
      To some untroubled star,
    Where thou, and Anah, shalt partake our lot:
      And if thou dost not weep for thy lost earth,
    Our forfeit Heaven shall also be forgot.

    _Anah_. Oh! my dear father's tents, my place of birth,
    And mountains, land, and woods! when ye are not,                   780
    Who shall dry up my tears?

    _Aza._                    Thy spirit-lord.
    Fear not; though we are shut from Heaven,
    Yet much is ours, whence we can not be driven.

    _Raph._ Rebel! thy words are wicked, as thy deeds
    Shall henceforth be but weak: the flaming sword,
    Which chased the first-born out of Paradise,
    Still flashes in the angelic hands.

    _Aza._ It cannot slay us: threaten dust with death,
    And talk of weapons unto that which bleeds.
    What are thy swords in our immortal eyes?                          790

    _Raph._ The moment cometh to approve thy strength;
              And learn at length
    How vain to war with what thy God commands:
    Thy former force was in thy faith.

                   _Enter Mortals, flying for refuge_.

                           _Chorus of Mortals_.

    The heavens and earth are mingling--God! oh God!
    What have we done? Yet spare!
    Hark! even the forest beasts howl forth their prayer!
      The dragon crawls from out his den,
      To herd, in terror, innocent with men;
    And the birds scream their agony through air.                      800
    Yet, yet, Jehovah! yet withdraw thy rod
    Of wrath, and pity thine own world's despair!
    Hear not man only but all nature plead!

    _Raph._ Farewell, thou earth! ye wretched sons of clay,
    I cannot, must not, aid you. 'Tis decreed!
                                                          [_Exit_ RAPHAEL.

    _Japh._ Some clouds sweep on as vultures for their prey,
    While others, fixed as rocks, await the word
    At which their wrathful vials shall be poured.
    No azure more shall robe the firmament,
      Nor spangled stars be glorious: Death hath risen:                810
    In the Sun's place a pale and ghastly glare
    Hath wound itself around the dying air.

    _Aza._ Come, Anah! quit this chaos-founded prison,
    To which the elements again repair,
    To turn it into what it was: beneath
    The shelter of these wings thou shall be safe,
    As was the eagle's nestling once within
    Its mother's.--Let the coming chaos chafe
    With all its elements! Heed not their din!
    A brighter world than this, where thou shalt breathe               820
    Ethereal life, will we explore:
    These darkened clouds are not the only skies.

                            [AZAZIEL _and_ SAMIASA _fly off, and disappear
                                 with_ ANAH _and_ AHOLIBAMAH.

    _Japh._ They are gone! They have disappeared amidst the roar
    Of the forsaken world; and never more,
    Whether they live, or die with all Earth's life,
    Now near its last, can aught restore
    Anah unto these eyes.

                           _Chorus of Mortals_.

    Oh son of Noah! mercy on thy kind!
    What! wilt thou leave us all--all--_all_ behind?
    While safe amidst the elemental strife,                            830
    Thou sitt'st within thy guarded ark?

    _A Mother_ (_offering her infant to_ JAPHET).
          Oh, let this child embark!
          I brought him forth in woe,
               But thought it joy
       To see him to my bosom clinging so.
               Why was he born?
               What hath he done--
               My unweaned son--
        To move Jehovah's wrath or scorn?
        What is there in this milk of mine, that Death                 840
          Should stir all Heaven and Earth up to destroy
                   My boy,
        And roll the waters o'er his placid breath?
        Save him, thou seed of Seth!
        Or cursed be--with him who made
        Thee and thy race, for which we are betrayed!

    _Japh._ Peace! 'tis no hour for curses, but for prayer!

                           _Chorus of Mortals_.

                    For prayer!!!
                    And where
                Shall prayer ascend,                                   850
    When the swoln clouds unto the mountains bend
                    And burst,
    And gushing oceans every barrier rend,
      Until the very deserts know no thirst?
                    Accursed
    Be he who made thee and thy sire!
    We deem our curses vain; we must expire;
            But as we know the worst,
    Why should our hymns be raised, our knees be bent
    Before the implacable Omnipotent,                                  860
    Since we must fall the same?
    If he hath made Earth, let it be his shame,
      To make a world for torture.--Lo! they come,
    The loathsome waters, in their rage!
      And with their roar make wholesome nature dumb!
      The forest's trees (coeval with the hour
    When Paradise upsprung,
      Ere Eve gave Adam knowledge for her dower,
    Or Adam his first hymn of slavery sung),
      So massy, vast, yet green in their old age,                      870
              Are overtopped,
    Their summer blossoms by the surges lopped,
    Which rise, and rise, and rise.
    Vainly we look up to the lowering skies--
      They meet the seas,
    And shut out God from our beseeching eyes.
      Fly, son of Noah, fly! and take thine ease,
    In thine allotted ocean-tent;
    And view, all floating o'er the element,
    The corpses of the world of thy young days:                        880
            Then to Jehovah raise
            Thy song of praise!

    _A Mortal_.
                Blessed are the dead
                Who die in the Lord!
    And though the waters be o'er earth outspread,
                Yet, as _his_ word,
                Be the decree adored!
    He gave me life--he taketh but
      The breath which is his own:
    And though these eyes should be for ever shut,                     890
      Nor longer this weak voice before his throne
      Be heard in supplicating tone,
              Still blessed be the Lord,
                For what is past,
                For that which is:
                For all are his,
                From first to last--

the following passage in Tournefort: "It is a most frightful sight;
David might well say such sort of places show the grandeur of the Lord.
One can't but tremble to behold it; and to look on the horrible
precipices ever so little will make the head turn round. The noise made
by a vast number of crows [hence the 'rushing sound,' _vide post_, p.
295], who are continually flying from one side to the other, has
something in it very frightful. To form any idea of this place you must
imagine one of the highest mountains in the world opening its bosom,
only to show the most horrible spectacle that can be thought of. All the
precipices are perpendicular, and the extremities are rough and
blackish, as if a smoke came out of the sides and smutted them."--_A

Kitto also describes this "vast chasm," which contained "an enormous
mass of ice, which seems to have fallen from a cliff that overhangs the
ice" (_Travels in Persia_, 1846, i. 34); but Professor Friedrich Parrot,
who was the first to ascend Mount Ararat, does not enlarge upon the

[Some fragments of the _Book of Enoch_ (_vide ante_, Introduction to
_Heaven and Earth_, p. 281), which were included by Georgius Syncellus
(a Byzantine writer of the eighth century A.D.) in his _Chronographia_,
pp. ii, 26 (_Corpus Script. Hist. Byzantintae_, 1829, i. 20), were
printed by J. J. Scaliger in 1606. They were, afterwards, included (i.
347-354) in the _Spicilegium SS. Patrum_ of Joannes Ernestus Grabius,
which was published at Oxford in 1714. A year after (1715) one of the
fragments was "made English," and published under the title of _The
History of the Angels and their Gallantry with the Daughters of Men_,
written by Enoch the Patriarch.

In 1785 James Bruce, the traveller, discovered three MSS. of the _Book
of Enoch_. One he conveyed to the library at Paris: a second MS. he
presented to the Bodleian Library at Oxford (_Travels_, ii. 422, 8vo ed.
1805). In 1801 an article entitled, "Notice du Libre d'Enoch," was
contributed by Silvestre de Sacy to the _Magasin Encyclopedique_ (An.
vi. tom. i. p. 369); and in 1821 Richard Laurence, LL.D., published a
translation "from the Ethiopic MS. in the Bodleian Library." This was
the first translation of the book as a whole.

The following extracts, which were evidently within Byron's recollection
when he planned _Heaven and Earth_, are taken from _The Book of Enoch_,
translated from Professor Dillman's Ethiopic Text, by R. H. Charles,
Oxford, 1892:--

"Chap. vi. [1. And it came to pass when the children of men had
multiplied in those days that beautiful and comely daughters were born
unto them. [2. And the angels, the sons of the Heavens, saw and lusted
after them, and spake one to another, 'Come now, let us choose us wives
from among the children of men, and beget children.' [3. And Semjaza,
who was the leader, spake unto them: I fear ye will not indeed agree to
do this deed.... [6. And they descended in the days of Jared on the
summit of Mount Hermon....

"Chap. viii. [i. And Azazel taught men to make swords, etc.

"Chap. x. Then spake the Most High, the Great, the Holy One, and sent
Arsjalaljur (= Uriel) to the son of Lamech, and said to him, 'Tell him
in My Name to hide thyself!' and reveal to him that the end is
approaching; for the whole earth will be destroyed, and a deluge will
presently cover up the whole earth, and all that is in it will be
destroyed. [3. And now instruct him that he may escape, as his seed may
be preserved for all generations. [4. And again the Lord spake to
Rafael; Bind Azazel hand and foot, and place him in darkness; make an
opening in the desert which is in Dudael and place him therein. [5. And
place upon him rough and ragged rocks," etc.]

[152] {306}[This does not correspond with Cain's statement--"After the
fall too soon was I begotten," _Cain_, act. iii. sc. I, line 506 (_vide

Bayle (_Hist. and Crit. Dict._, 1735, art. "Eve," note B) has a great
deal to say with regard to the exact date of the birth of Cain. He
concludes with _Cornelius a Lapide_, who quotes Torniellus, "Cain
genitum ease mox post expulsionem Adae et Evae ex Paradiso."]

[158] {321}[Sketch of Second Part of _Heaven and Earth_, as reported by
Medwin (_Conversations_, 1824, pp. 234-237)--

"Azazael and Samiasa ... rise into the air with the two sisters.... The
appearance of the land strangled by the ocean will serve by way of
scenery and decorations. The affectionate tenderness of Adah for those
from whom she is parted, and for ever, and her fears contrasting with
the loftier spirit of Aholibamah triumphing in the hopes of a new and
greater destiny will make the dialogue. They, in the meantime, continue
their aerial voyage, everywhere denied admittance in those floating
islands over the sea of space, and driven back by guardian-spirits of
the different planets, till they are at length forced to alight on the
only peak of the earth uncovered by water. Here a parting takes place
between the lovers.... The fallen angels are suddenly called, and
condemned, their destination and punishment unknown. The sisters cling
to the rock, the waters mounting higher and higher. Now enter Ark. The
scene draws up, and discovers Japhet endeavouring to persuade the
Patriarch, with very strong arguments of love and pity, to receive the
sisters, or at least Adah, on board. Adah joins in his entreaties, and
endeavours to cling to the sides of the vessel. The proud and haughty
Aholibamah scorns to pray either to God or man, and anticipates the
grave by plunging into the waters. Noah is still inexorable. [Adah] is
momentarily in danger of perishing before the eyes of the Arkites.
Japhet is in despair. The last wave sweeps her from the rock, and her
lifeless corpse floats past in all its beauty, whilst a sea-bird screams
over it, and seems to be the spirit of her angel lord. I once thought of
conveying the lovers to the moon or one of the planets; but it is not
easy for the imagination to make any unknown world more beautiful than
this; besides, I did not think they would approve of the moon as a
residence. I remember what Fontenelle said of its having no atmosphere,
and the dark spots having caverns where the inhabitants reside. There
was another objection: all the human interest would have been destroyed,
which I have even endeavoured to give my angels."]

                                 A TRAGEDY.

[_Werner_ was produced, for the first time, at the Park Theatre, New
York, in 1826. Mr. Barry played "Werner."

_Werner_ was brought out at Drury Lane Theatre, and played, for the
first time, December 15, 1830. Macready appeared as "Werner," J. W.
Wallack as "Ulric," Mrs. Faucit as "Josephine," and Miss Mordaunt as
"Ida." According to the _Times_, December 16, 1830, "Mr. Macready
appeared to very great advantage. We have never seen him exert himself
more--we have never known him to exert himself with more powerful
effect. Three of his scenes were masterpieces." Genest says that
_Werner_ was acted seventeen times in 1830-31.

There was a revival in 1833. Macready says (_Diary_, March 20) that he
acted "'Werner' with unusual force, truth, and collectedness ...
finished off each burst of passion, and, in consequence, entered on the
following emotion with clearness and earnestness" (Macready's
_Reminiscences_, 1875, i 36.6).

_Werner_ was played in 1834, 5, 6, 7, 9; in 1841; in 1843-4 (New York,
Boston, Baltimore, New Orleans, Cincinnati, Montreal); in 1845 (Paris,
London, Glasgow, Belfast, Dublin); in 1846, 1847; in America in 1848; in
the provinces in 1849; in 1850; and, for the last time, at the Theatre
Royal, Haymarket, January 14, 1851. At the farewell performance Macready
appeared as "Werner," Mr. Davenport as "Ulric," Mrs. Warner as
"Josephine," Mrs. Ryder as "Ida." In the same year (1851) a portrait of
Macready as "Werner," by Daniel Maclise, R.A., was on view at the
Exhibition at the Royal Academy. The motto was taken from _Werner_, act
i. sc. 1, lines 114, _sq._ (See, for a detailed criticism of Macready's
"Werner," _Our Recent Actors_, by Westland Marston, 1881, i. 89-98; and
for the famous "Macready _burst_," in act ii. sc. 2, and act v. sc. 1,
_vide ibid._, i. 97.)

_Werner_ was brought out at Sadler's Wells Theatre, November 21, 1860,
and repeated November 22, 23, 24, 28, 29; December, 3, 4, 11, 13, 14,
1860. Phelps appeared as "Werner," Mr. Edmund Phelps as "Ulric," Miss
Atkinson as "Josephine." "Perhaps the old actor never performed the part
so finely as he did on that night. The identity between the real and
ideal relations of the characters was as vivid to him as to the
audience, and gave a deeper intensity, on both sides, to the scenes
between father and son." (See _The London Stage_, by H. Barton Baker,
1889, ii. 217.)

On the afternoon of June 1, 1887, _Werner_ (four acts, arranged by Frank
Marshall) was performed at the Lyceum Theatre for the benefit of
Westland Marston. [Sir] Henry Irving appeared as "Werner," Miss Ellen
Terry as "Josephine," Mr. Alexander as "Ulric." (See for an appreciation
of Sir Henry Irving's presentation of _Werner_, the _Athenaeum_, June 4,
1887.)]




                        INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.


_Werner; or, The Inheritance_, was begun at Pisa, December 18, 1821, and
finished January 20, 1822. At the end of the month, January 29, Byron
despatched the MS., not to Murray, but to Moore, then in retreat at
Paris, intending, no doubt, that it should be placed in the hands of
another publisher; but a letter from Murray "melted him," and on March
6, 1822 (_Letters_, 1901, vi. 34), he desired Moore to forward the
packet to Albemarle Street. The play was set up in type, and revised
proofs were returned to Murray at the end of June; but, for various
reasons, publication was withheld, and, on October 31, Byron informed
John Hunt that he had empowered his friend Douglas Kinnaird to obtain
_Werner_, with other MSS., from Murray. None the less, milder counsels
again prevailed, and on Saturday, November 23, 1822, _Werner_ was
published, not in the same volume with _Heaven and Earth_, as Byron
intended and expected, nor by John Hunt, as he had threatened, but by
itself, and, as heretofore, by John Murray. _Werner_ was "the last of
all the flock" to issue from Murray's fold.

In his Preface to _Werner_ (_vide post_, p. 337) Byron disclaims all
pretensions to originality. "The following drama," he writes, "is taken
entirely from the 'German's Tale, Kruitzner,' published ... in Lee's
_Canterbury Tales_.... I have adopted the characters, plan, and even the
language, of many parts of this story." _Kruitzner_ seems to have made a
deep impression on his mind. When he was a boy of thirteen (_i.e._ in
1801, when the fourth volume of the _Canterbury Tales_ was published),
and again in 1815, he set himself to turn the tale into a drama. His
first attempt, named _Ulric and Ilvina_, he threw into the fire, but he
had nearly completed the first act of his second and maturer adaptation
when he was "interrupted by circumstances," that is, no doubt, the
circumstances which led up to and ended in the separation from his
wife. (See letter of October 9, 1821, _Letters_, 1901, v. 391.)

On his leaving England for the Continent, April 25, 1816, the fragment
was left behind. Most probably the MS. fell into his sister's hands, for
in October, 1821, it was not forthcoming when Byron gave directions that
Hobhouse should search for it "amongst my papers." Ultimately it came
into the possession of the late Mr. Murray, and is now printed for the
first time in its entirety (_vide post_, pp. 453-466: selections were
given in the _Nineteenth Century_, August, 1899). It should be borne in
mind that this unprinted first act of _Werner_, which synchronizes with
the _Siege of Corinth_ and _Parisina_, was written when Byron was a
member of the sub-committee of management of Drury Lane Theatre, and, as
the numerous stage directions testify, with a view to
stage-representation. The MS. is scored with corrections, and betrays an
unusual elaboration, and, perhaps, some difficulty and hesitation in the
choice of words and the construction of sentences. In the opening scene
the situation is not caught and gripped, while the melancholy squalor of
the original narrative is only too faithfully reproduced. The _Werner_
of 1821, with all its shortcomings, is the production of a playwright.
The _Werner_ of 1815 is the attempt of a highly gifted amateur.

When Byron once more bethought himself of his old subject, he not only
sent for the MS. of the first act, but desired Murray "to cut out Sophia
Lee's" (_vide post_, p. 337) "_German's Tale_ from the _Canterbury
Tales_, and send it in a letter" (_Letters_, 1901, v. 390). He seems to
have intended from the first to construct a drama out of the story, and,
no doubt, to acknowledge the source of his inspiration. On the whole, he
carried out his intention, taking places, characters, and incidents as
he found them, but recasting the materials and turning prose into metre.
But here and there, to save himself trouble, he "stole his brooms ready
made," and, as he acknowledges in the Preface, "adopted even the
language of the story." Act ii. sc. 2, lines 87-172; act iii. sc. 4; and
act v. sc. 1, lines 94-479, are, more or less, faithful and exact
reproductions of pp. 203-206, 228-232, and 252-271 of the novel (see
_Canterbury Tales_, ed. 1832, vol. ii.). On the other hand, in the
remaining three-fourths of the play, the language is not Miss Lee's, but
Byron's, and the "conveyance" of incidents occasional and insignificant.
Much, too, was imported into the play (_e.g._ almost the whole of the
fourth act), of which there is neither hint nor suggestion in the story.
Maginn's categorical statement (see "O'Doherty on _Werner_,"
_Miscellanies_, 1885, i. 189) that "here Lord Byron has _invented_
nothing--absolutely, positively, undeniably NOTHING;" that "there is not
one incident in his play, not even the most trivial, that is not to be
found in the novel," etc., is "positively and undeniably" a falsehood.
Maginn read _Werner_ for the purpose of attacking Byron, and, by
printing selected passages from the novel and the play, in parallel
columns, gives the reader to understand that he had made an exhaustive
analysis of the original and the copy. The review, which is quoted as an
authority in the editions of 1832 (xiv. pp. 113, 114) and 1837, etc., p.
341, is disingenuous and misleading.

The original story may be briefly retold. The prodigal and outlawed son
of a Bohemian noble, Count Siegendorf, after various adventures,
marries, under the assumed name of Friedrich Kruitzner, the daughter of
an Italian scholar and man of science, of noble birth, but in narrow
circumstances. A son, Conrad, is born to him, who, at eight years of
age, is transferred to the charge of his grandfather. Twelve years go
by, and, when the fortunes of the younger Siegendorf are at their lowest
ebb, he learns, at the same moment, that his father is dead, and that a
distant kinsman, the Baron Stralenheim, is meditating an attack on his
person, with a view to claiming his inheritance. Of Conrad, who has
disappeared, he hears nothing.

An accident compels the count and the baron to occupy adjoining quarters
in a small town on the northern frontier of Silesia; and, again, another
accident places the usurping and intriguing baron at the mercy of his
poverty-stricken and exiled kinsman. Stralenheim has fallen asleep near
the fire in his easy-chair. Papers and several rouleaux of gold are
ranged on a cabinet beside the bed. Kruitzner, who is armed with "a
large and sharp knife," is suddenly confronted with his unarmed and
slumbering foe, and though habit and conscience conspire to make murder
impossible, he yields to a sudden and irresistible impulse, and snatches
up "the portion of gold which is nearest." He has no sooner returned to
his wife and confessed his deed, than Conrad suddenly appears on the
scene, and at the very moment of an unexpected and joyous reunion with
his parents, learns that his father is a thief. Kruitzner pleads "guilty
with extenuating circumstances," and Conrad, who either is or pretends
to be disgusted at his father's sophistries, makes the best of a bad
business, and undertakes to conceal his father's dishonour and rescue
him from the power of Stralenheim. The plot hinges on the unlooked-for
and unsuspected action of Conrad. Unlike his father, he is not the man
to let "I dare not wait upon I would," but murders Stralenheim in cold
blood, and, at the same time, diverts suspicion from his father and
himself to the person of his comrade, a Hungarian soldier of fortune,
who is already supposed to be the thief, and who had sought and obtained
shelter in the apartments of the conscience-stricken Kruitzner.

The scene changes to Prague. Siegendorf, no longer Kruitzner, has
regained his inheritance, and is once more at the height of splendour
and prosperity. A service of thanksgiving is being held in the cathedral
to commemorate the signature of the Treaty of Prague (1635), and the
count is present in state. Suddenly he catches sight of the Hungarian,
and, "like a flash of lightning" feels and remembers that he _is_ a
thief, and that he might, however unjustly, be suspected if not accused
of the murder of Stralenheim. The service is over, and the count is
recrossing "Muldau's Bridge," when he hears the fatal word _Kruitzner_,
"the seal of his shame," spoken in his ear. He returns to his castle,
and issues orders that the Hungarian should be arrested and
interrogated. An interview takes place, at which the Hungarian denounces
Conrad as the murderer of Stralenheim. The son acknowledges the deed,
and upbraids the father for his weakness and credulity in supposing that
his escape from Stralenheim's machinations could have been effected by
any other means. If, he argues, circumstances can palliate dishonesty,
they can compel and justify murder. Common sense even now demands the
immediate slaughter of the Hungarian, as it compelled and sanctioned the
effectual silencing of Stralenheim. But Siegendorf knows not "thorough,"
and shrinks at assassination. He repudiates and denounces his son, and
connives at the escape of the Hungarian. Conrad, who is banished from
Prague, rejoins his former associates, the "black bands," which were the
scandal and terror of the neighbouring provinces, and is killed in a
skirmish with the regular troops. Siegendorf dies of a broken heart.

The conception of _The German's Tale_, as Byron perceived, is superior
to the execution. The style is laboured and involved, and the narrative
long-winded and tiresome. It is, perhaps, an adaptation, though not a
literal translation, of a German historical romance. But the _motif_--a
son predestined to evil by the weakness and sensuality of his father, a
father punished for his want of rectitude by the passionate criminality
of his son, is the very key-note of tragedy.

If from haste or indolence Byron scamped his task, and cut up whole
cantles of the novel into nerveless and pointless blank verse, here and
there throughout the play, in scattered lines and passages, he outdoes
himself. The inspiration is fitful, but supreme.

NOTE TO THE INTRODUCTION TO _WERNER_.

In an article entitled, "Did Byron write _Werner_?" which appeared in
the _Nineteenth Century_ (August, 1899, vol. 46, pp. 243-250), the Hon.
F. Leveson Gower undertakes to prove that _Werner_ was not written by
Lord Byron, but by Georgiana, Duchess of Devonshire (born June 9, 1757,
died March 30, 1806). He adduces, in support of this claim, (1) a
statement made to him by his sister, the late Lady Georgiana Fullerton,
to the effect that their grandmother, the duchess, "wrote the poem and
gave the MS. to her niece, Lady Caroline Ponsonby (better known as Lady
Caroline Lamb), and that she, some years later, handed it over to Lord
Byron, who, in 1822, published it in his own name;" (2) a letter written
in 1822 by his mother, Lady Granville, to her sister, Lady Carlisle,
which asserts that their mother, the duchess, "wrote an entire tragedy
from Miss Lee's _Kreutzner the Hungarian_ (_sic_)," and that the MS. had
been sent to her by Lady Caroline's brother, Mr. William Ponsonby, and
was in her possession; (3) another letter of Lady Granville's, dated
December 3, 1822, in which she informs her sister that her husband, Lord
Granville, had promised to read _Werner_ aloud to her (i.e. Byron's
_Werner_, published November 23, 1822), a promise which, if fulfilled,
must have revealed one of two things--the existence of two dramas based
on Miss Lee's _Kruitzner_, or the identity of Byron's version with that
of the duchess. Now, argues Mr. Leveson Gower, if Lady Granville had
known that two dramas were in existence, she would not have allowed her
daughter, Lady Georgiana Fullerton, to believe "that the duchess was the
author of the published poem."

I will deal with the external evidence first. Practically it amounts to
this: (1) that Lady Granville knew that her mother, the Duchess of
Devonshire, dramatized Miss Lee's _Kruitzner_; and (2) that Lady
Georgiana Fullerton believed that the duchess gave the MS. of her play
to Lady Caroline Ponsonby, and that, many years after, Lady Caroline
handed it over to Byron.

The external evidence establishes the fact that the Duchess of
Devonshire dramatized _Kruitzner_, but it does not prove that Byron
purloined her adaptation. It records an unverified impression on the
part of the duchess's granddaughter, that the MS. of a play written
between the years 1801-1806, passed into Byron's hands about the year
1813; that he took a copy of the MS.; and that in 1821-22 he caused his
copy to be retranscribed and published under his own name.

But Mr. Leveson Gower appeals to internal as well as external evidence,
(1) He regards the great inferiority of _Werner_ to Byron's published
plays, and to the genuine (hitherto) unpublished first act, together
with the wholesale plagiarisms from Miss Lee's story, as an additional
proof that the work was none of his. (2) He notes, as a suspicious
circumstance, that "while the rough copies of his other poems have been
preserved, no rough copy of _Werner_ is to be found."

In conclusion, he deals with two possible objections which may be
brought against his theory: (1) that Byron would not have incurred the
risk of detection at the hands of the owners of the duchess's MS.; and
(2) that a great poet of assured fame and reputation could have had no
possible motive for perpetrating a literary fraud. The first objection
he answers by assuming that Byron would have counted on the reluctance
of the "Ponsonby family and the daughters of the Duchess" to rake up the
ashes of old scandals; the second, by pointing out that, in 1822, he was
making "frantic endeavours to obtain money, not for himself, but to help
the cause of Greece."

(1) With regard to the marked inferiority of _Werner_ to Byron's other
plays, and the relative proportion of adapted to original matter, Mr.
Leveson Gower appears to have been misled by the disingenuous criticism
of Maginn and other contemporary reviewers (_vide_ the Introduction,
etc., p. 326). There is no such inferiority, and the plagiarisms, which
were duly acknowledged, are confined to certain limited portions of the
play. (2) There is nothing unusual in the fact that the rough draft of
_Werner_ cannot be found. In fact, but few of the early drafts of the
dramas and other poems written in the later Italian days ever reached
Murray's hands, or are still in existence. The fair copy for the printer
alone was sent home. The time had gone by when Byron's publisher, who
was also his friend, would stipulate that "all the original MSS.,
copies and scraps" should fall to his share. But no argument can be
founded on so insignificant a circumstance.

Finally, the argument on which Mr. Leveson Gower dwells at some length,
that Byron's "motive" for perpetrating a literary fraud was the
necessity for raising money for the cause of Greek independence, is
refuted by the fact that _Werner_ was begun in December, 1821, and
finished in January, 1822, and that it was not till the spring of 1823
that he was elected a member of the Greek Committee, or had any occasion
to raise funds for the maintenance of troops or the general expenses of
the war. So far from attempting to raise money by _Werner_, in letters
to Murray, dated March 6, October 24, November 18, 1822, he emphatically
waives the question of "terms," and makes no demand or request for money
whatever. It was not till December 23, 1823 (_Letters_, 1901, vi. 287),
two years after the play had been written, that he speaks of applying
the two or three hundred pounds which the copyright of _Werner_ might be
worth, to the maintenance of armed men in the service of the
_Provisional Government_. He could not have "purloined" and palmed off
as his own the duchess's version of Miss Lee's story in order to raise
money for a purpose which had not arisen. He had no intention at first
or last of presenting the copyright of _Werner_ to Murray or Hunt, but
he was willing to wait for his money, and had no motive for raising
funds by an illegal and dishonourable trick.

That Byron did _not_ write _Werner_ is, surely, non-proven on the
external and internal evidence adduced by Mr. Leveson Gower. On the
other hand, there is abundant evidence, both external and internal,
that, apart from his acknowledged indebtedness to Miss Lee's story, he
did write _Werner_.

To take the external evidence first. On the first page of Mrs. Shelley's
transcript of _Werner_, Byron inserted the date, "Dec. 18, 1821," and on
the last he wrote "[The End] of fifth act of the Drama. B. P[isa]. Jy
21. 1822."

Turning to the journal of Edward Williams (Shelley's _Prose Works_,
1880, iv. 318), I find the following entries:--

"December 21, 1821. Lord B. told me that he had commenced a tragedy from
Miss Lee's _German Tale_ ('_Werner_'), and had been fagging at it all
day."

"January 8, 1822. Mary read us the first two acts of Lord B.'s
_Werner_."

Again, in an unpublished diary of the same period it is recorded that
Mrs. Shelley was engaged in the task of copying on January 17, 1822, and
the eight following days, and that on January 25 she finished her
transcript.

Again, Medwin (_Conversations_, 1824, p. 409) records the fact that
Byron told him "that he had almost finished another play ... called
_Werner_;" and (p. 412) "that _Werner_ was written in twenty-eight days,
and one entire act at a sitting." It is almost incredible that Byron
should have recopied a copy of the duchess's play in order to impose on
Mrs. Shelley and Williams and Medwin; and it is quite incredible that
they were in the plot, and lent themselves to the deception. It is
certain that both Williams and Medwin believed that Byron was the author
of _Werner_, and it is certain that nothing would have induced Mrs.
Shelley to be _particeps criminis_--to copy a play which was not
Byron's, to be published as Byron's, and to suffer her copy to be
fraudulently endorsed by her guilty accomplice.

The internal evidence of the genuineness of _Werner_ is still more
convincing. In the first place, there are numerous "undesigned
coincidences," allusions, and phrases to be found in _Werner_ and
elsewhere in Byron's _Poetical Works_, which bear his sign-manual, and
cannot be attributed to another writer; and, secondly, scattered through
the play there are numerous lines, passages, allusions--"a cloud of
witnesses" to their Byronic inspiration and creation.

Take the following parallels:--

_Werner_, act i. sc. 1, lines 693, 694--

          "... as parchment on a drum,
    Like Ziska's skin."

_Age of Bronze_, lines 133, 134--

                     "The time may come,
    His name shall beat the alarm like Ziska's drum."

_Werner_, act ii. sc. 2, lines 177, 178--

                 "... save your throat
    From the Raven-stone."

_Manfred_, act iii. (original version)--

    "The raven sits
      On the Raven-stone."

_Werner_, act ii. sc. 2, line 279--

    "Things which had made this silkworm cast his skin."

_Marino Faliero_, act ii. sc. 2, line 115--

    "... these swoln silkworms masters."

("Silkworm," as a term of contempt, is an Italianism.)

_Werner_, act iii. sc. 1, lines 288, 289--

    "I fear that men must draw their chariots, as
    They say kings did Sesostris'."

_Age of Bronze_, line 45--

    "The new Sesostris, whose unharnessed kings."

_Werner_, act iii. sc. 3, lines 10, 11--

           "... while the knoll
    Of long-lived parents."

_Childe Harold_, Canto III. stanza xcvi. lines 5, 6--

                    "... is the knoll
    Of what in me is sleepless."

(Byron is the authority for the use of "knoll" as a substantive.)

Or, compare the statement (see act i. sc. 1, line 213, _sq._) that "A
great personage ... is drowned below the ford, with five post-horses, A
monkey and a mastiff--and a valet," with the corresponding passage in
_Kruitzner_ and in Byron's unfinished fragment; and note that "the
monkey, the mastiff, and the valet," which formed part of Byron's
retinue in 1821, are conspicuous by their absence from Miss Lee's story
and the fragment.

Space precludes the quotation of further parallels, and for specimens of
a score of passages which proclaim their author the following lines must
suffice:--

Act i. sc. 1, lines 163-165--

                    "... although then
    My passions were all living serpents, and
    Twined like the Gorgon's round me."

Act iii. sc. 1, lines 264-268--

              "... sound him with the gem;
    'Twill sink into his venal soul like lead
    Into the deep, and bring up slime and mud.
    And ooze, too, from the bottom, as the lead doth
    With its greased understratum."

_Did_ Byron write _Werner_, or was it the Duchess of Devonshire?

                                TO

                      THE ILLUSTRIOUS GOETHE


                  BY ONE OF HIS HUMBLEST ADMIRERS,


                            THIS TRAGEDY

                            IS DEDICATED.




                               PREFACE

The following drama is taken entirely from the _German's Tale,
Kruitzner_, published many years ago in "Lee's _Canterbury Tales_"
written (I believe) by two sisters, of whom one furnished only this
story and another, both of which are considered superior to the
remainder of the collection.[159] I have adopted the characters, plan,
and even the language of many parts of this story. Some of the
characters are modified or altered, a few of the names changed, and one
character (Ida of Stralenheim) added by myself: but in the rest the
original is chiefly followed. When I was young (about fourteen, I
think,) I first read this tale, which made a deep impression upon me;
and may, indeed, be said to contain the germ of much that I have since
written. I am not sure that it ever was very popular; or, at any rate,
its popularity has since been eclipsed by that of other great writers in
the same department. But I have generally found that those who _had_
read it, agreed with me in their estimate of the singular power of mind
and conception which it developes. I should also add _conception_,
rather than execution; for the story might, perhaps, have been developed
with greater advantage. Amongst those whose opinions agreed with mine
upon this story, I could mention some very high names: but it is not
necessary, nor indeed of any use; for every one must judge according to
his own feelings. I merely refer the reader to the original story, that
he may see to what extent I have borrowed from it; and am not unwilling
that he should find much greater pleasure in perusing it than the drama
which is founded upon its contents.

I had begun a drama upon this tale so far back as 1815, (the first I
ever attempted, except one at thirteen years old, called "Ulric and
Ilvina," which I had sense enough to burn,) and had nearly completed an
act, when I was interrupted by circumstances. This is somewhere amongst
my papers in England; but as it has not been found, I have re-written
the first, and added the subsequent acts.

The whole is neither intended, nor in any shape adapted, for the
stage[cm].

           SCENE I.--_The Hall of a decayed Palace near a small
           Town on the Northern Frontier of Silesia--the Night
                   tempestuous_.

                   WERNER _and_ JOSEPHINE, _his Wife_.

    _Jos._ My love, be calmer!

    _Wer._                     I am calm.

    _Jos._                               To me--
    Yes, but not to thyself: thy pace is hurried,
    And no one walks a chamber like to ours,
    With steps like thine, when his heart is at rest.
    Were it a garden, I should deem thee happy,
    And stepping with the bee from flower to flower;
    But _here!_

    _Wer._      'Tis chill; the tapestry lets through
    The wind to which it waves: my blood is frozen.

    _Jos._ Ah, no!

    _Wer._ (_smiling_). Why! wouldst thou have it so?

    _Jos._                                            I would
    Have it a healthful current.

    _Wer._                        Let it flow                           10
    Until 'tis spilt or checked--how soon, I care not.

    _Jos._ And am I nothing in thy heart?

    _Wer._                                All--all.

    _Jos._ Then canst thou wish for that which must break mine?

    _Wer._ (_approaching her slowly_).
    But for _thee_ I had been--no matter what--
    But much of good and evil; what I am,
    Thou knowest; what I might or should have been,
    Thou knowest not: but still I love thee, nor
    Shall aught divide us.
               [WERNER _walks on abruptly, and then approaches_ JOSEPHINE.
                          The storm of the night,
    Perhaps affects me; I'm a thing of feelings,
    And have of late been sickly, as, alas!                             20
    Thou know'st by sufferings more than mine, my Love!
    In watching me.

    _Jos._          To see thee well is much--
    To see thee happy----

    _Wer._                Where hast thou seen such?
    Let me be wretched with the rest!

    _Jos._                            But think
    How many in this hour of tempest shiver
    Beneath the biting wind and heavy rain,
    Whose every drop bows them down nearer earth,
    Which hath no chamber for them save beneath
    Her surface.

    _Wer._        And that's not the worst: who cares
    For chambers? rest is all. The wretches whom                        30
    Thou namest--aye, the wind howls round them, and
    The dull and dropping rain saps in their bones
    The creeping marrow. I have been a soldier,
    A hunter, and a traveller, and am
    A beggar, and should know the thing thou talk'st of.

    _Jos._ And art thou not now sheltered from them all?
    _Wer._ Yes. And from these alone.

    _Jos._                           And that is something.

    _Wer._ True--to a peasant.[cn]

    _Jos._                       Should the nobly born
    Be thankless for that refuge which their habits
    Of early delicacy render more                                       40
    Needful than to the peasant, when the ebb
    Of fortune leaves them on the shoals of life?

    _Wer._ It is not that, thou know'st it is not: we
    Have borne all this, I'll not say patiently,
    Except in thee--but we have borne it.

    _Jos._                                Well?

    _Wer._ Something beyond our outward sufferings (though
    These were enough to gnaw into our souls)
    Hath stung me oft, and, more than ever, _now_.
    When, but for this untoward sickness, which
    Seized me upon this desolate frontier, and                          50
    Hath wasted, not alone my strength, but means,
    And leaves us--no! this is beyond me!--but
    For this I had been happy--_thou_ been happy--
    The splendour of my rank sustained--my name--
    My father's name--been still upheld; and, more
    Than those----

    _Jos._ (_abruptly_). My son--our son--our Ulric,
    Been clasped again in these long-empty arms,
    And all a mother's hunger satisfied.
    Twelve years! he was but eight then:--beautiful
    He was, and beautiful he must be now,                               60
    My Ulric! my adored!

    _Wer._               I have been full oft
    The chase of Fortune; now she hath o'ertaken
    My spirit where it cannot turn at bay,--
    Sick, poor, and lonely.

    _Jos._                  Lonely! my dear husband?

    _Wer._ Or worse--involving all I love, in this
    Far worse than solitude. _Alone_, I had died,
    And all been over in a nameless grave.

    _Jos._ And I had not outlived thee; but pray take
    Comfort! We have struggled long; and they who strive
    With Fortune win or weary her at last,                              70
    So that they find the goal or cease to feel
    Further. Take comfort,--we shall find our boy.

    _Wer._ We were in sight of him, of every thing
    Which could bring compensation for past sorrow--
    And to be baffled thus!

    _Jos._                  We are not baffled.

    _Wer._ Are we not penniless?

    _Jos._                       We ne'er were wealthy.

    _Wer._ But I was born to wealth, and rank, and power;
    Enjoyed them, loved them, and, alas! abused them,
    And forfeited them by my father's wrath,
    In my o'er-fervent youth: but for the abuse                         80
    Long-sufferings have atoned. My father's death
    Left the path open, yet not without snares.
    This cold and creeping kinsman, who so long
    Kept his eye on me, as the snake upon
    The fluttering bird, hath ere this time outstept me,
    Become the master of my rights, and lord
    Of that which lifts him up to princes in
    Dominion and domain.

    _Jos._               Who knows? our son
    May have returned back to his grandsire, and
    Even now uphold thy rights for thee?

    _Wer._                              'Tis hopeless.                  90
    Since his strange disappearance from my father's,
    Entailing, as it were, my sins upon
    Himself, no tidings have revealed his course.
    I parted with him to his grandsire, on
    The promise that his anger would stop short
    Of the third generation; but Heaven seems
    To claim her stern prerogative, and visit
    Upon my boy his father's faults and follies.

    _Jos._ I must hope better still,--at least we have yet
    Baffled the long pursuit of Stralenheim.                           100

    _Wer._ We should have done, but for this fatal sickness;--
    More fatal than a mortal malady,
    Because it takes not life, but life's sole solace:
    Even now I feel my spirit girt about
    By the snares of this avaricious fiend:--
    How do I know he hath not tracked us here?

    _Jos._ He does not know thy person; and his spies,
    Who so long watched thee, have been left at Hamburgh.
    Our unexpected journey, and this change
    Of name, leaves all discovery far behind:                          110
    None hold us here for aught save what we seem.

    _Wer._ Save what we seem! save what we _are_--sick beggars,
    Even to our very hopes.--Ha! ha!

    _Jos._                           Alas!
    That bitter laugh!

    _Wer._            _Who_ would read in this form
    The high soul of the son of a long line?
    _Who_, in this garb, the heir of princely lands?
    _Who_, in this sunken, sickly eye, the pride
    Of rank and ancestry? In this worn cheek
    And famine-hollowed brow, the Lord of halls
    Which daily feast a thousand vassals?

    _Jos._                                You                          120
    Pondered not thus upon these worldly things,
    My Werner! when you deigned to choose for bride
    The foreign daughter of a wandering exile.

    _Wer._ An exile's daughter with an outcast son,
    Were a fit marriage: but I still had hopes
    To lift thee to the state we both were born for.
    Your father's house was noble, though decayed;
    And worthy by its birth to match with ours.

    _Jos._ Your father did not think so, though 'twas noble;
    But had my birth been all my claim to match                        130
    With thee, I should have deemed it what it is.

    _Wer._ And what is that in thine eyes?

    _Jos._                                 All which it
    Has done in our behalf,--nothing.

    _Wer._                            How,--nothing?

    _Jos._ Or worse; for it has been a canker in
    Thy heart from the beginning: but for this,
    We had not felt our poverty but as
    Millions of myriads feel it--cheerfully;
    But for these phantoms of thy feudal fathers,
    Thou mightst have earned thy bread, as thousands earn it;
    Or, if that seem too humble, tried by commerce,                    140
    Or other civic means, to amend thy fortunes.

    _Wer._ (_ironically_). And been an Hanseatic burgher? Excellent!

    _Jos._ Whate'er thou mightest have been, to me thou art
    What no state high or low can ever change,
    My heart's first choice;--which chose thee, knowing neither
    Thy birth, thy hopes, thy pride; nought, save thy sorrows:
    While they last, let me comfort or divide them:
    When they end--let mine end with them, or thee!

    _Wer._ My better angel! Such I have ever found thee;
    This rashness, or this weakness of my temper,                      150
    Ne'er raised a thought to injure thee or thine.
    Thou didst not mar my fortunes: my own nature
    In youth was such as to unmake an empire,
    Had such been my inheritance; but now,
    Chastened, subdued, out-worn, and taught to know
    Myself,--to lose this for our son and thee!
    Trust me, when, in my two-and-twentieth spring,
    My father barred me from my father's house,
    The last sole scion of a thousand sires
    (For I was then the last), it hurt me less                         160
    Than to behold my boy and my boy's mother
    Excluded in their innocence from what
    My faults deserved-exclusion; although then
    My passions were all living serpents,[161] and
    Twined like the Gorgon's round me.
                                              [_A loud knocking is heard_.

    _Jos._                             Hark!

    _Wer._                                  A knocking!

    _Jos._ Who can it be at this lone hour? We have
    Few visitors.

    _Wer._        And poverty hath none,
    Save those who come to make it poorer still.
    Well--I am prepared.

                             [WERNER _puts his hand into his bosom, as if
                                to search for some weapon_.

    _Jos._               Oh! do not look so. I
    Will to the door. It cannot be of import                           170
    In this lone spot of wintry desolation:--
    The very desert saves man from mankind.
                                                  [_She goes to the door_.

                            _Enter_ IDENSTEIN.

    _Iden._ A fair good evening to my fair hostess
    And worthy----What's your name, my friend?

    _Wer._                                   Are you
    Not afraid to demand it?

    _Iden._                  Not afraid?
    Egad! I am afraid. You look as if
    I asked for something better than your name,
    By the face you put on it.

    _Wer._                    Better, sir!

    _Iden._ Better or worse, like matrimony: what
    Shall I say more? You have been a guest this month                 180
    Here in the prince's palace--(to be sure,
    His Highness had resigned it to the ghosts
    And rats these twelve years--but 'tis still a palace)--
    I say you have been our lodger, and as yet
    We do not know your name.

    _Wer._                    My name is Werner[162].

    _Iden._ A goodly name, a very worthy name,
    As e'er was gilt upon a trader's board:
    I have a cousin in the lazaretto
    Of Hamburgh, who has got a wife who bore
    The same. He is an officer of trust,                               190
    Surgeon's assistant (hoping to be surgeon),
    And has done miracles i' the way of business.
    Perhaps you are related to my relative?

    _Wer._ To yours?

    _Jos._           Oh, yes; we are, but distantly.
    (_Aside to_ WERNER.) Cannot you humour the dull gossip till
    We learn his purpose?

    _Iden._               Well, I'm glad of that;
    I thought so all along, such natural yearnings
    Played round my heart:--blood is not water, cousin;
    And so let's have some wine, and drink unto
    Our better acquaintance: relatives should be                       200
    Friends.

    _Wer._ You appear to have drunk enough already;
    And if you have not, I've no wine to offer,
    Else it were yours: but this you know, or should know:
    You see I am poor, and sick, and will not see
    That I would be alone; but to your business!
    What brings you here?

    _Iden._              Why, what should bring me here?

    _Wer._ I know not, though I think that I could guess
    That which will send you hence.

    _Jos._ (_aside_).               Patience, dear Werner!

    _Iden._ You don't know what has happened, then?

    _Jos._                                        How should we?

    _Iden._ The river has o'erflowed.

    _Jos._                            Alas! we have known              210
    That to our sorrow for these five days; since
    It keeps us here.

    _Iden._           But what you don't know is,
    That a great personage, who fain would cross
    Against the stream and three postilions' wishes,
    Is drowned below the ford, with five post-horses,
    A monkey, and a mastiff--and a valet[163].

    _Jos._ Poor creatures! are you sure?

    _Iden._                              Yes, of the monkey,
    And the valet, and the cattle; but as yet
    We know not if his Excellency's dead
    Or no; your noblemen are hard to drown,                            220
    As it is fit that men in office should be;
    But what is certain is, that he has swallowed
    Enough of the Oder[164] to have burst two peasants;
    And now a Saxon and Hungarian traveller,
    Who, at their proper peril, snatched him from
    The whirling river, have sent on to crave
    A lodging, or a grave, according as
    It may turn out with the live or dead body.

    _Jos._ And where will you receive him? here, I hope,
    If we can be of service--say the word.                             230

    _Iden._ Here? no; but in the Prince's own apartment,
    As fits a noble guest:--'tis damp, no doubt,
    Not having been inhabited these twelve years;
    But then he comes from a much damper place,
    So scarcely will catch cold in't, if he be
    Still liable to cold--and if not, why
    He'll be worse lodged to-morrow: ne'ertheless,
    I have ordered fire and all appliances
    To be got ready for the worst--that is,
    In case he should survive.

    _Jos._                     Poor gentleman!                         240
    I hope he will, with all my heart.

    _Wer._                              Intendant,
    Have you not learned his name? (_Aside to his wife_.) My Josephine,
    Retire: I'll sift this fool.                        [_Exit_ JOSEPHINE.

    _Iden._                      His name? oh Lord!
    Who knows if he hath now a name or no?
    'Tis time enough to ask it when he's able
    To give an answer; or if not, to put
    His heir's upon his epitaph. Methought
    Just now you chid me for demanding names?

    _Wer._ True, true, I did so: you say well and wisely.

                           _Enter_ GABOR.[165]

    _Gab._ If I intrude, I crave----

    _Iden._                          Oh, no intrusion!                 250
    This is the palace; this a stranger like
    Yourself; I pray you make yourself at home:
    But where's his Excellency? and how fares he?

    _Gab._ Wetly and wearily, but out of peril:
    He paused to change his garments in a cottage
    (Where I doffed mine for these, and came on hither),
    And has almost recovered from his drenching.
    He will be here anon.

    _Iden._               What ho, there! bustle!
    Without there, Herman, Weilburg, Peter, Conrad!
                      [_Gives directions to different servants who enter_.
    A nobleman sleeps here to-night--see that                          260
    All is in order in the damask chamber--
    Keep up the stove--I will myself to the cellar--
    And Madame Idenstein (my consort, stranger,)
    Shall furnish forth the bed-apparel; for,
    To say the truth, they are marvellous scant of this
    Within the palace precincts, since his Highness
    Left it some dozen years ago. And then
    His Excellency will sup, doubtless?

    _Gab._                              Faith!
    I cannot tell; but I should think the pillow
    Would please him better than the table, after                      270
    His soaking in your river: but for fear
    Your viands should be thrown away, I mean
    To sup myself, and have a friend without
    Who will do honour to your good cheer with
    A traveller's appetite.

    _Iden._                  But are you sure
    His Excellency----But his name: what is it?

    _Gab._ I do not know.

    _Iden._               And yet you saved his life.

    _Gab._ I helped my friend to do so.

    _Iden._                             Well, that's strange,
    To save a man's life whom you do not know.

    _Gab._ Not so; for there are some I know so well,                  280
    I scarce should give myself the trouble.

    _Iden._                                 Pray,
    Good friend, and who may you be?

    _Gab._                          By my family,
    Hungarian.

    _Iden._    Which is called?

    _Gab._                    It matters little.

    _Iden._ (_aside_). I think that all the world are grown anonymous,
    Since no one cares to tell me what he's called!
    Pray, has his Excellency a large suite?

    _Gab._                                  Sufficient.

    _Iden._ How many?

    _Gab._            I did not count them.
    We came up by mere accident, and just
    In time to drag him through his carriage window.

    _Iden._ Well, what would I give to save a great man!               290
    No doubt you'll have a swingeing sum as recompense.

    _Gab._ Perhaps.

    _Iden._         Now, how much do you reckon on?

    _Gab._ I have not yet put up myself to sale:
    In the mean time, my best reward would be
    A glass of your[166] Hockcheimer--a _green_ glass,
    Wreathed with rich grapes and Bacchanal devices,
    O'erflowing with the oldest of your vintage:
    For which I promise you, in case you e'er
    Run hazard of being drowned, (although I own
    It seems, of all deaths, the least likely for you,)                300
    I'll pull you out for nothing. Quick, my friend,
    And think, for every bumper I shall quaff,
    A wave the less may roll above your head.

    _Iden._ (_aside_). I don't much like this fellow--close and dry
    He seems,--two things which suit me not; however,
    Wine he shall have; if that unlocks him not,
    I shall not sleep to-night for curiosity.           [_Exit_ IDENSTEIN.

    _Gab._ (_to_ WERNER). This master of the ceremonies is
    The intendant of the palace, I presume:
    'Tis a fine building, but decayed.

    _Wer._                             The apartment                   310
    Designed for him you rescued will be found
    In fitter order for a sickly guest.

    _Gab._ I wonder then you occupied it not,
    For you seem delicate in health.

    _Wer._ (_quickly_).              Sir!

    _Gab._                               Pray
    Excuse me: have I said aught to offend you?

    _Wer._ Nothing: but we are strangers to each other.

    _Gab._ And that's the reason I would have us less so:
    I thought our bustling guest without had said
    You were a chance and passing guest, the counterpart
    Of me and my companions.

    _Wer._                   Very true.                                320

    _Gab._ Then, as we never met before, and never,
    It may be, may again encounter, why,
    I thought to cheer up this old dungeon here
    (At least to me) by asking you to share
    The fare of my companions and myself.

    _Wer._ Pray, pardon me; my health----

    _Gab._                             Even as you please.
    I have been a soldier, and perhaps am blunt
    In bearing.

    _Wer._      I have also served, and can
    Requite a soldier's greeting.

    _Gab._                        In what service?
    The Imperial?

    _Wer._ (_quickly, and then interrupting himself_).
                 I commanded--no--I mean                               330
    I served; but it is many years ago,
    When first Bohemia[167] raised her banner 'gainst
    The Austrian.

    _Gab._        Well, that's over now, and peace
    Has turned some thousand gallant hearts adrift
    To live as they best may: and, to say truth,
    Some take the shortest.

    _Wer._                  What is that?

    _Gab._                                Whate'er
    They lay their hands on. All Silesia and
    Lusatia's woods are tenanted by bands
    Of the late troops, who levy on the country
    Their maintenance: the Chatelains must keep                        340
    Their castle walls--beyond them 'tis but doubtful
    Travel for your rich Count or full-blown Baron.
    My comfort is that, wander where I may,
    I've little left to lose now.

    _Wer._                        And I--nothing.

    _Gab._ That's harder still. You say you were a soldier.

    _Wer._ I was.

    _Gab._        You look one still. All soldiers are
    Or should be comrades, even though enemies.
    Our swords when drawn must cross, our engines aim
    (While levelled) at each other's hearts; but when
    A truce, a peace, or what you will, remits                         350
    The steel into its scabbard, and lets sleep
    The spark which lights the matchlock, we are brethren.
    You are poor and sickly--I am not rich, but healthy;
    I want for nothing which I cannot want;
    You seem devoid of this--wilt share it?
                                             [GABOR _pulls out his purse_.

    _Wer._                                  Who
    Told you I was a beggar?

    _Gab._                   You yourself,
    In saying you were a soldier during peace-time.

    _Wer._ (_looking at him with suspicion_). You know me not.

    _Gab._      I know no man, not even
    Myself: how should I then know one I ne'er
    Beheld till half an hour since?

    _Wer._                          Sir, I thank you.                  360
    Your offer's noble were it to a friend,
    And not unkind as to an unknown stranger,
    Though scarcely prudent; but no less I thank you.
    I am a beggar in all save his trade;
    And when I beg of any one, it shall be
    Of him who was the first to offer what
    Few can obtain by asking. Pardon me.                   [_Exit_ WERNER.

    _Gab._ (_solus_). A goodly fellow by his looks, though worn
    As most good fellows are, by pain or pleasure,
    Which tear life out of us before our time;                         370
    I scarce know which most quickly: but he seems
    To have seen better days, as who has not
    Who has seen yesterday?--But here approaches
    Our sage intendant, with the wine: however,
    For the cup's sake I'll bear the cupbearer.

                            _Enter_ IDENSTEIN.

    _Iden._ 'Tis here! the _supernaculum!_[168] twenty years
    Of age, if 'tis a day.

    _Gab._                 Which epoch makes
    Young women and old wine; and 'tis great pity,
    Of two such excellent things, increase of years,
    Which still improves the one, should spoil the other.              380
    Fill full--Here's to our hostess!--your fair wife!
                                                       [_Takes the glass_.

    _Iden._ Fair!--Well, I trust your taste in wine is equal
    To that you show for beauty; but I pledge you
    Nevertheless.

    _Gab._        Is not the lovely woman
    I met in the adjacent hall, who, with
    An air, and port, and eye, which would have better
    Beseemed this palace in its brightest days
    (Though in a garb adapted to its present
    Abandonment), returned my salutation--
    Is not the same your spouse?

    _Iden._                     I would she were!                      390
    But you're mistaken:--that's the stranger's wife.

    _Gab._ And by her aspect she might be a Prince's;
    Though time hath touched her too, she still retains
    Much beauty, and more majesty.

    _Iden._                        And that
    Is more than I can say for Madame Idenstein,
    At least in beauty: as for majesty,
    She has some of its properties which might
    Be spared--but never mind!

    _Gab._                     I don't. But who
    May be this stranger? He too hath a bearing
    Above his outward fortunes.

    _Iden._                     There I differ.                        400
    He's poor as Job, and not so patient; but
    Who he may be, or what, or aught of him,
    Except his name (and that I only learned
    To-night), I know not.

    _Gab._                 But how came he here?

    _Iden._ In a most miserable old caleche,
    About a month since, and immediately
    Fell sick, almost to death. He should have died.

    _Gab._ Tender and true!--but why?

    _Iden._                           Why, what is life
    Without a living? He has not a stiver.[co]

    _Gab._ In that case, I much wonder that a person                   410
    Of your apparent prudence should admit
    Guests so forlorn into this noble mansion.

    _Iden._ That's true: but pity, as you know, _does_ make
    One's heart commit these follies; and besides,
    They had some valuables left at that time,
    Which paid their way up to the present hour;
    And so I thought they might as well be lodged
    Here as at the small tavern, and I gave them
    The run of some of the oldest palace rooms.
    They served to air them, at the least as long                      420
    As they could pay for firewood.

    _Gab._                          Poor souls!

    _Iden._                                    Aye,
    Exceeding poor.

    _Gab._          And yet unused to poverty,
    If I mistake not. Whither were they going?

    _Iden._ Oh! Heaven knows where, unless to Heaven itself.
    Some days ago that looked the likeliest journey
    For Werner.

    _Gab._      Werner! I have heard the name.
    But it may be a feigned one.

    _Iden._                      Like enough!
    But hark! a noise of wheels and voices, and
    A blaze of torches from without. As sure
    As destiny, his Excellency's come.                                 430
    I must be at my post; will you not join me,
    To help him from his carriage, and present
    Your humble duty at the door?

    _Gab._                        I dragged him
    From out that carriage when he would have given
    His barony or county to repel
    The rushing river from his gurgling throat.
    He has valets now enough: they stood aloof then,
    Shaking their dripping ears upon the shore,
    All roaring "Help!" but offering none; and as
    For _duty_ (as you call it)--I did mine _then_,                    440
    Now do _yours_. Hence, and bow and cringe him here!

    _Iden._ _I_ cringe!--but I shall lose the opportunity--
    Plague take it! he'll be _here_, and I _not there!_
                                              [_Exit_ IDENSTEIN _hastily_.

                            _Re-enter_ WERNER.

    _Wer._ (_to himself_). I heard a noise of wheels and voices. How
    All sounds now jar me!                            [_Perceiving_ GABOR.
                          Still here! Is he not
    A spy of my pursuer's? His frank offer
    So suddenly, and to a stranger, wore
    The aspect of a secret enemy;
    For friends are slow at such.

    _Gab._                       Sir, you seem rapt;
    And yet the time is not akin to thought.                           450
    These old walls will be noisy soon. The baron,
    Or count (or whatsoe'er this half drowned noble
    May be), for whom this desolate village and
    Its lone inhabitants show more respect
    Than did the elements, is come.

    _Iden._ (_without_).            This way--
    This way, your Excellency:--have a care,
    The staircase is a little gloomy, and
    Somewhat decayed; but if we had expected
    So high a guest--Pray take my arm, my Lord!

         _Enter_ STRALENHEIM, IDENSTEIN, _and Attendants--partly
          his own, and partly Retainers of the Domain of which_
                        IDENSTEIN _is Intendant_.

    _Stral._ I'll rest here a moment.

    _Iden._ (_to the servants_).     Ho! a chair!                      460
    Instantly, knaves.                           [STRALENHEIM _sits down_.

    _Wer._ (_aside_). Tis he!

    _Stral._                  I'm better now.
    Who are these strangers?

    _Iden._                 Please you, my good Lord,
    One says he is no stranger.

    _Wer._ (_aloud and hastily_). _Who_ says that?
                                        [_They look at him with surprise_.

    _Iden._ Why, no one spoke _of you_, or _to you_!--but
    Here's one his Excellency may be pleased
    To recognise.                                    [_Pointing to_ GABOR.

    _Gab._       I seek not to disturb
    His noble memory.

    _Stral._          I apprehend
    This is one of the strangers to whose aid[cp]
    I owe my rescue. Is not that the other?
                                                    [_Pointing to_ WERNER.
    My state when I was succoured must excuse                          470
    My uncertainty to whom I owe so much.

    _Iden._ He!--no, my Lord! he rather wants for rescue
    Than can afford it. 'Tis a poor sick man,
    Travel-tired, and lately risen from a bed
    From whence he never dreamed to rise.

    _Stral._                              Methought
    That there were two.

    _Gab._               There were, in company;
    But, in the service rendered to your Lordship,
    I needs must say but _one_, and he is absent.
    The chief part of whatever aid was rendered
    Was _his_: it was his fortune to be first.                         480
    My will was not inferior, but his strength
    And youth outstripped me; therefore do not waste
    Your thanks on me. I was but a glad second
    Unto a nobler principal.

    _Stral._                 Where is he?

    _An Atten._ My Lord, he tarried in the cottage where
    Your Excellency rested for an hour,
    And said he would be here to-morrow.

    _Stral._                             Till
    That hour arrives, I can but offer thanks,
    And then----

    _Gab._      I seek no more, and scarce deserve
    So much. My comrade may speak for himself.                         490

    _Stral._ (_fixing his eyes upon_ WERNER: _then aside_).
      It cannot be! and yet he must be looked to.
    'Tis twenty years since I beheld him with
    These eyes; and, though my agents still have kept
    _Theirs_ on him, policy has held aloof
    My own from his, not to alarm him into
    Suspicion of my plan. Why did I leave
    At Hamburgh those who would have made assurance
    If this be he or no? I thought, ere now,
    To have been lord of Siegendorf, and parted
    In haste, though even the elements appear                          500
    To fight against me, and this sudden flood
    May keep me prisoner here till----
                         [_He pauses and looks at_ WERNER: _then resumes_.
                                      This man must
    Be watched. If it is he, he is so changed,
    His father, rising from his grave again,
    Would pass by him unknown. I must be wary:
    An error would spoil all.

    _Iden._                   Your Lordship seems
    Pensive. Will it not please you to pass on?

    _Stral._ 'Tis past fatigue, which gives my weighed-down spirit
    An outward show of thought. I will to rest.

    _Iden._ The Prince's chamber is prepared, with all                 510
    The very furniture the Prince used when
    Last here, in its full splendour.
                           (_Aside_). Somewhat tattered,
    And devilish damp, but fine enough by torch-light;
    And that's enough for your right noble blood
    Of twenty quarterings upon a hatchment;
    So let their bearer sleep 'neath something like one
    Now, as he one day will for ever lie.

    _Stral._ (_rising and turning to_ GABOR).
    Good night, good people! Sir, I trust to-morrow
    Will find me apter to requite your service.
    In the meantime I crave your company                               520
    A moment in my chamber.

    _Gab._                  I attend you.

    _Stral_, (_after a few steps, pauses, and calls_ WERNER).
    Friend!

    _Wer._ Sir!

    _Iden._ _Sir!_ Lord--oh Lord! Why don't you say
    His Lordship, or his Excellency? Pray,
    My Lord, excuse this poor man's want of breeding:
    He hath not been accustomed to admission
    To such a presence.

    _Stral._ (_to_ IDENSTEIN). Peace, intendant!

    _Iden._                                           Oh!
    I am dumb.

    _Stral._ (_to_ WERNER). Have you been long here?

    _Wer._                                          Long?

    _Stral._                                             I sought
    An answer, not an echo.

    _Wer._                  You may seek
    Both from the walls. I am not used to answer
    Those whom I know not.

    _Stral._                Indeed! Ne'er the less,                    530
    You might reply with courtesy to what
    Is asked in kindness.

    _Wer._                When I know it such
    I will requite--that is, _reply_--in unison.

    _Stral._ The intendant said, you had been detained by sickness--
    If I could aid you--journeying the same way?

    _Wer._ (_quickly_). I am not journeying the same way!

    _Stral._                                             How know ye
    That, ere you know my route?

    _Wer._                      Because there is
    But one way that the rich and poor must tread
    Together. You diverged from that dread path
    Some hours ago, and I some days: henceforth                        540
    Our roads must lie asunder, though they tend
    All to one home.

    _Stral._         Your language is above
    Your station.

    _Wer._ (_bitterly_). Is it?

    _Stral._                    Or, at least, beyond
    Your garb.

    _Wer._ 'Tis well that it is not beneath it,
    As sometimes happens to the better clad.
    But, in a word, what would you with me?

    _Stral._ (_startled_).                  I?

    _Wer._ Yes--you! You know me not, and question me,
    And wonder that I answer not--not knowing
    My inquisitor. Explain what you would have,
    And then I'll satisfy yourself, or me.                             550

    _Stral._ I knew not that you had reasons for reserve.

    _Wer._ Many have such:--Have you none?

    _Stral._                               None which can
    Interest a mere stranger.

    _Wer._                    Then forgive
    The same unknown and humble stranger, if
    He wishes to remain so to the man
    Who can have nought in common with him.

    _Stral._                                Sir,
    I will not balk your humour, though untoward:
    I only meant you service--but good night!
    Intendant, show the way! (_To_ GABOR.) Sir, you will with me?
            [_Exeunt_ STRALENHEIM _and Attendants_; IDENSTEIN _and_ GABOR.

    _Wer._ (_solus_). 'Tis he! I am taken in the toils. Before         560
    I quitted Hamburg, Giulio, his late steward,
    Informed me, that he had obtained an order
    From Brandenburg's elector, for the arrest
    Of Kruitzner (such the name I then bore) when
    I came upon the frontier; the free city
    Alone preserved my freedom--till I left
    Its walls--fool that I was to quit them! But
    I deemed this humble garb, and route obscure,
    Had baffled the slow hounds in their pursuit.
    What's to be done? He knows me not by person;                      570
    Nor could aught, save the eye of apprehension,
    Have recognised _him_, after twenty years--
    We met so rarely and so coldly in
    Our youth. But those about him! Now I can
    Divine the frankness of the Hungarian, who
    No doubt is a mere tool and spy of Stralenheim's,
    To sound and to secure me. Without means!
    Sick, poor--begirt too with the flooding rivers,
    Impassable even to the wealthy, with
    All the appliances which purchase modes                            580
    Of overpowering peril, with men's lives,--
    How can I hope! An hour ago methought
    My state beyond despair; and now, 'tis such,
    The past seems paradise. Another day,
    And I'm detected,--on the very eve
    Of honours, rights, and my inheritance,
    When a few drops of gold might save me still
    In favouring an escape.

    _Enter_ IDENSTEIN _and_ FRITZ _in conversation_.

    _Fritz_.                Immediately.

    _Iden._ I tell you, 'tis impossible.

    _Fritz_.                             It must
    Be tried, however; and if one express                              590
    Fail, you must send on others, till the answer
    Arrives from Frankfort, from the commandant.

    _Iden._ I will do what I can.

    _Fritz_.                      And recollect
    To spare no trouble; you will be repaid
    Tenfold.

    _Iden._ The Baron is retired to rest?

    _Fritz_. He hath thrown himself into an easy chair
    Beside the fire, and slumbers; and has ordered
    He may not be disturbed until eleven,
    When he will take himself to bed.

    _Iden._                           Before
    An hour is past I'll do my best to serve him.                      600

    _Fritz_. Remember!                                      [_Exit_ FRITZ.

    _Iden._            The devil take these great men! they
    Think all things made for them. Now here must I
    Rouse up some half a dozen shivering vassals
    From their scant pallets, and, at peril of
    Their lives, despatch them o'er the river towards
    Frankfort. Methinks the Baron's own experience
    Some hours ago might teach him fellow-feeling:
    But no, "it _must_" and there's an end. How now?
    Are you there, Mynheer Werner?

    _Wer._                         You have left
    Your noble guest right quickly.

    _Iden._                         Yes--he's dozing,                  610
    And seems to like that none should sleep besides.
    Here is a packet for the Commandant
    Of Frankfort, at all risks and all expenses;
    But I must not lose time: Good night!                    [_Exit_ IDEN.

    _Wer._                               "To Frankfort!"
    So, so, it thickens! Aye, "the Commandant!"
    This tallies well with all the prior steps
    Of this cool, calculating fiend, who walks
    Between me and my father's house. No doubt
    He writes for a detachment to convey me
    Into some secret fortress.--Sooner than                            620
    This----
                      [WERNER _looks around, and snatches up a knife lying
                             on a table in a recess_.
              Now I am master of myself at least.
    Hark,--footsteps! How do I know that Stralenheim
    Will wait for even the show of that authority
    Which is to overshadow usurpation?
    That he suspects me 's certain. I'm alone--
    He with a numerous train: I weak--he strong
    In gold, in numbers, rank, authority.
    I nameless, or involving in my name
    Destruction, till I reach my own domain;
    He full-blown with his titles, which impose                        630
    Still further on these obscure petty burghers
    Than they could do elsewhere. Hark! nearer still!
    I'll to the secret passage, which communicates
    With the----No! all is silent--'twas my fancy!--
    Still as the breathless interval between
    The flash and thunder:--I must hush my soul
    Amidst its perils. Yet I will retire,
    To see if still be unexplored the passage
    I wot of: it will serve me as a den
    Of secrecy for some hours, at the worst.                           640
                  [WERNER _draws a panel, and exit, closing it after him_.

                      _Enter_ GABOR _and_ JOSEPHINE.

    _Gab._ Where is your husband?

    _Jos._                        _Here_, I thought: I left him
    Not long since in his chamber. But these rooms
    Have many outlets, and he may be gone
    To accompany the Intendant.

    _Gab._                      Baron Stralenheim
    Put many questions to the Intendant on
    The subject of your lord, and, to be plain,
    I have my doubts if he means well.

    _Jos._                             Alas!
    What can there be in common with the proud
    And wealthy Baron, and the unknown Werner?

    _Gab._ That you know best.

    _Jos._                     Or, if it were so, how                  650
    Come you to stir yourself in his behalf,
    Rather than that of him whose life you saved?

    _Gab._ I helped to save him, as in peril; but
    I did not pledge myself to serve him in
    Oppression. I know well these nobles, and
    Their thousand modes of trampling on the poor.
    I have proved them; and my spirit boils up when
    I find them practising against the weak:--
    This is my only motive.

    _Jos._                  It would be
    Not easy to persuade my consort of                                 660
    Your good intentions.

    _Gab._                Is he so suspicious?

    _Jos._ He was not once; but time and troubles have
    Made him what you beheld.

    _Gab._                    I'm sorry for it.
    Suspicion is a heavy armour, and
    With its own weight impedes more than protects.
    Good night! I trust to meet with him at day-break.
                                                            [_Exit_ GABOR.

                _Re-enter_ IDENSTEIN _and some Peasants_.
                     JOSEPHINE _retires up the Hall_.

    _First Peasant_. But if I'm drowned?

    _Iden._                      Why, you will be well paid for 't,
    And have risked more than drowning for as much,
    I doubt not.

    _Second Peasant_. But our wives and families?

    _Iden._ Cannot be worse off than they are, and may                 670
    Be better.

    _Third Peasant_. I have neither, and will venture.

    _Iden._ That's right. A gallant carle, and fit to be
    A soldier. I'll promote you to the ranks
    In the Prince's body-guard--if you succeed:
    And you shall have besides, in sparkling coin,
    Two thalers.

    _Third Peasant_. No more!

    _Iden._                   Out upon your avarice!
    Can that low vice alloy so much ambition?
    I tell thee, fellow, that two thalers in
    Small change will subdivide into a treasure.
    Do not five hundred thousand heroes daily                          680
    Risk lives and souls for the tithe of one thaler?
    When had you half the sum?

    _Third Peasant_.           Never--but ne'er
    The less I must have three.

    _Iden._                     Have you forgot
    Whose vassal you were born, knave?

    _Third Peasant_.                   No--the Prince's,
    And not the stranger's.

    _Iden._                 Sirrah! in the Prince's
    Absence, I am sovereign; and the Baron is
    My intimate connection;--"Cousin Idenstein!
    (Quoth he) you'll order out a dozen villains."
    And so, you villains! troop--march--march, I say;
    And if a single dog's ear of this packet                           690
    Be sprinkled by the Oder--look to it!
    For every page of paper, shall a hide
    Of yours be stretched as parchment on a drum,
    Like Ziska's skin,[169] to beat alarm to all
    Refractory vassals, who can not effect
    Impossibilities.--Away, ye earth-worms!
                                                [_Exit, driving them out_.

    _Jos._ (_coming forward_).
    I fain would shun these scenes, too oft repeated,
    Of feudal tyranny o'er petty victims;
    I cannot aid, and will not witness such.
    Even here, in this remote, unnamed, dull spot,                     700
    The dimmest in the district's map, exist
    The insolence of wealth in poverty
    O'er something poorer still--the pride of rank
    In servitude, o'er something still more servile;
    And vice in misery affecting still
    A tattered splendour. What a state of being!
    In Tuscany, my own dear sunny land,
    Our nobles were but citizens and merchants,[170]
    Like Cosmo. We had evils, but not such
    As these; and our all-ripe and gushing valleys                     710
    Made poverty more cheerful, where each herb
    Was in itself a meal, and every vine
    Rained, as it were, the beverage which makes glad
    The heart of man; and the ne'er unfelt sun
    (But rarely clouded, and when clouded, leaving
    His warmth behind in memory of his beams)
    Makes the worn mantle, and the thin robe, less
    Oppressive than an emperor's jewelled purple.
    But, here! the despots of the north appear
    To imitate the ice-wind of their clime,                            720
    Searching the shivering vassal through his rags,
    To wring his soul--as the bleak elements
    His form. And 'tis to be amongst these sovereigns
    My husband pants! and such his pride of birth--
    That twenty years of usage, such as no
    Father born in a humble state could nerve
    His soul to persecute a son withal,
    Hath changed no atom of his early nature;
    But I, born nobly also, from my father's
    Kindness was taught a different lesson. Father!                    730
    May thy long-tried and now rewarded spirit
    Look down on us and our so long desired
    Ulric! I love my son, as thou didst me!
    What's that? Thou, Werner! can it be? and thus?

           _Enter_ WERNER _hastily, with the knife in his hand,
        by the secret panel, which he closes hurriedly after him_.

    _Wer._ (_not at first recognising her_).
    Discovered! then I'll stab--(_recognising her_). Ah! Josephine
    Why art thou not at rest?

    _Jos._                    What rest? My God!
    What doth this mean?

    _Wer._ (_showing a rouleau_).
                       Here's _gold_--_gold_, Josephine,
    Will rescue us from this detested dungeon.

    _Jos._ And how obtained?--that knife!

    _Wer._                              'Tis bloodless--_yet_.
    Away--we must to our chamber.

    _Jos._                         But whence comest thou?             740

    _Wer._ Ask not! but let us think where we shall go--
    This--this will make us way--(_showing the gold_)--I'll fit them now.

    _Jos._ I dare not think thee guilty of dishonour.

    _Wer._ Dishonour!

    _Jos._            I have said it.

    _Wer._                           Let us hence:
    'Tis the last night, I trust, that we need pass here.

    _Jos._ And not the worst, I hope.

    _Wer._                            Hope! I make _sure_.
    But let us to our chamber.

    _Jos._                     Yet one question--
    What hast thou _done_?

    _Wer._ (_fiercely_). Left one thing _undone_, which
    Had made all well: let me not think of it!
    Away!

    _Jos._ Alas that I should doubt of thee!                           750
                                                                [_Exeunt_.




                                 ACT II.

                  SCENE I.--_A Hall in the same Palace_.

                     _Enter_ IDENSTEIN _and Others_.

    _Iden._ Fine doings! goodly doings! honest doings!
    A Baron pillaged in a Prince's palace!
    Where, till this hour, such a sin ne'er was heard of.

    _Fritz_. It hardly could, unless the rats despoiled
    The mice of a few shreds of tapestry.

    _Iden._ Oh! that I e'er should live to see this day!
    The honour of our city's gone for ever.

    _Fritz_. Well, but now to discover the delinquent:
    The Baron is determined not to lose
    This sum without a search.

    _Iden._                    And so am I.                             10

    _Fritz_. But whom do you suspect?

    _Iden._                           Suspect! all people
    Without--within--above--below--Heaven help me!

    _Fritz_. Is there no other entrance to the chamber?

    _Iden._   None whatsoever.

    _Fritz_.                  Are you sure of that?

    _Iden._ Certain. I have lived and served here since my birth,
    And if there were such, must have heard of such,
    Or seen it.

    _Fritz_.   Then it must be some one who
    Had access to the antechamber.

    _Iden._                        Doubtless.

    _Fritz_. The man called _Werner's_ poor!

    _Iden._                                 Poor as a miser[171].
    But lodged so far off, in the other wing,                           20
    By which there's no communication with
    The baron's chamber, that it can't be he.
    Besides, I bade him "good night" in the hall,
    Almost a mile off, and which only leads
    To his own apartment, about the same time
    When this burglarious, larcenous felony
    Appears to have been committed.

    _Fritz_.                        There's another,
    The stranger----

    _Iden._          The Hungarian?

    _Fritz_.                      He who helped
    To fish the baron from the Oder.

    _Iden._                          Not
    Unlikely. But, hold--might it not have been                         30
    One of the suite?

    _Fritz_.          How? _We_, sir!

    _Iden._                          No--not _you_,
    But some of the inferior knaves. You say
    The Baron was asleep in the great chair--
    The velvet chair--in his embroidered night-gown;
    His toilet spread before him, and upon it
    A cabinet with letters, papers, and
    Several rouleaux of gold; of which _one_ only
    Has disappeared:--the door unbolted, with
    No difficult access to any.

    _Fritz_.                    Good sir,
    Be not so quick; the honour of the corps                            40
    Which forms the Baron's household's unimpeached
    From steward to scullion, save in the fair way
    Of peculation; such as in accompts,
    Weights, measures, larder, cellar, buttery,
    Where all men take their prey; as also in
    Postage of letters, gathering of rents,
    Purveying feasts, and understanding with
    The honest trades who furnish noble masters[cq];
    But for your petty, picking, downright thievery,
    We scorn it as we do board wages. Then                              50
    Had one of our folks done it, he would not
    Have been so poor a spirit as to hazard
    His neck for _one_ rouleau, but have swooped all;
    Also the cabinet, if portable.

    _Iden._ There is some sense in that----

    _Fritz_.                                No, Sir, be sure
    'Twas none of our corps; but some petty, trivial
    Picker and stealer, without art or genius.
    The only question is--Who else could have
    Access, save the Hungarian and yourself?

    _Iden._ You don't mean me?

    _Fritz_.                   No, sir; I honour more                   60
    Your talents----

    _Iden._          And my principles, I hope.

    _Fritz_. Of course. But to the point: What's to be done?

    _Iden._ Nothing--but there's a good deal to be said.
    We'll offer a reward; move heaven and earth,
    And the police (though there's none nearer than
    Frankfort); post notices in manuscript
    (For we've no printer); and set by my clerk
    To read them (for few can, save he and I).
    We'll send out villains to strip beggars, and
    Search empty pockets; also, to arrest                               70
    All gipsies, and ill-clothed and sallow people.
    Prisoners we'll have at least, if not the culprit;
    And for the Baron's gold--if 'tis not found,
    At least he shall have the full satisfaction
    Of melting twice its substance in the raising
    The ghost of this rouleau. Here's alchemy
    For your Lord's losses!

    _Fritz_.                He hath found a better.

    _Iden._ _Where?_

    _Fritz_.         In a most immense inheritance.
    The late Count Siegendorf, his distant kinsman,
    Is dead near Prague, in his castle, and my Lord                     80
    Is on his way to take possession.

    _Iden._                           Was there
    No heir?

    _Fritz_. Oh, yes; but he has disappeared
    Long from the world's eye, and, perhaps, the world.
    A prodigal son, beneath his father's ban
    For the last twenty years; for whom his sire
    Refused to kill the fatted calf; and, therefore,
    If living, he must chew the husks still. But
    The Baron would find means to silence him,
    Were he to re-appear: he's politic,
    And has much influence with a certain court.                        90

    _Iden._ He's fortunate.

    _Fritz_.                'Tis true, there is a grandson,
    Whom the late Count reclaimed from his son's hands,
    And educated as his heir; but, then,
    His birth is doubtful.

    _Iden._                How so?

    _Fritz_.                      His sire made
    A left-hand, love, imprudent sort of marriage,
    With an Italian exile's dark-eyed daughter:
    Noble, they say, too; but no match for such
    A house as Siegendorf's. The grandsire ill
    Could brook the alliance; and could ne'er be brought
    To see the parents, though he took the son.                        100

    _Iden._ If he's a lad of mettle, he may yet
    Dispute your claim, and weave a web that may
    Puzzle your Baron to unravel.

    _Fritz_.                      Why,
    For mettle, he has quite enough: they say,
    He forms a happy mixture of his sire
    And grandsire's qualities,--impetuous as
    The former, and deep as the latter; but
    The strangest is, that he too disappeared
    Some months ago.

    _Iden._          The devil he did!

    _Fritz_.                          Why, yes:
    It must have been at _his_ suggestion, at                          110
    An hour so critical as was the eve
    Of the old man's death, whose heart was broken by it.

    _Iden._ Was there no cause assigned?

    _Fritz_.                             Plenty, no doubt,
    And none, perhaps, the true one. Some averred
    It was to seek his parents; some because
    The old man held his spirit in so strictly
    (But that could scarce be, for he doted on him);
    A third believed he wished to serve in war,
    But, peace being made soon after his departure,
    He might have since returned, were that the motive;                120
    A fourth set charitably have surmised,
    As there was something strange and mystic in him,
    That in the wild exuberance of his nature
    He had joined the black bands[172], who lay waste Lusatia,
    The mountains of Bohemia and Silesia,
    Since the last years of war had dwindled into
    A kind of general condottiero system
    Of bandit-warfare; each troop with its chief,
    And all against mankind.

    _Iden._                 That cannot be.
    A young heir, bred to wealth and luxury,                           130
    To risk his life and honours with disbanded
    Soldiers and desperadoes!

    _Fritz_.                  Heaven best knows!
    But there are human natures so allied
    Unto the savage love of enterprise,
    That they will seek for peril as a pleasure.
    I've heard that nothing can reclaim your Indian,
    Or tame the tiger, though their infancy
    Were fed on milk and honey. After all,
    Your Wallenstein, your Tilly and Gustavus,
    Your Bannier, and your Torstenson and Weimar[173],                 140
    Were but the same thing upon a grand scale;
    And now that they are gone, and peace proclaimed,
    They who would follow the same pastime must
    Pursue it on their own account. Here comes
    The Baron, and the Saxon stranger, who
    Was his chief aid in yesterday's escape,
    But did not leave the cottage by the Oder
    Until this morning.

                     _Enter_ STRALENHEIM _and_ ULRIC.

    _Stral._            Since you have refused
    All compensation, gentle stranger, save
    Inadequate thanks, you almost check even them,                     150
    Making me feel the worthlessness of words,
    And blush at my own barren gratitude,
    They seem so niggardly, compared with what
    Your courteous courage did in my behalf----

    _Ulr._ I pray you press the theme no further.

    _Stral._                                      But
    Can I not serve you? You are young, and of
    That mould which throws out heroes; fair in favour;
    Brave, I know, by my living now to say so;
    And, doubtlessly, with such a form and heart,
    Would look into the fiery eyes of War,                             160
    As ardently for glory as you dared
    An obscure death to save an unknown stranger,
    In an as perilous, but opposite, element.
    You are made for the service: I have served;
    Have rank by birth and soldiership, and friends,
    Who shall be yours. 'Tis true this pause of peace
    Favours such views at present scantily;
    But 'twill not last, men's spirits are too stirring;
    And, after thirty years of conflict, peace
    Is but a petty war, as the time shows us                           170
    In every forest, or a mere armed truce.
    War will reclaim his own; and, in the meantime,
    You might obtain a post, which would ensure
    A higher soon, and, by my influence, fail not
    To rise. I speak of Brandenburgh, wherein
    I stand well with the Elector[174]; in Bohemia,
    Like you, I am a stranger, and we are now
    Upon its frontier.

    _Ulr._             You perceive my garb
    Is Saxon, and, of course, my service due
    To my own Sovereign. If I must decline                             180
    Your offer, 'tis with the same feeling which
    Induced it.

    _Stral._    Why, this is mere usury!
    I owe my life to you, and you refuse
    The acquittance of the interest of the debt,
    To heap more obligations on me, till
    I bow beneath them.

    _Ulr._              You shall say so when
    I claim the payment.

    _Stral._             Well, sir, since you will not--
    You are nobly born?

    _Ulr._              I have heard my kinsmen say so.

    _Stral._ Your actions show it. Might I ask your name?

    _Ulr._ Ulric.

    _Stral._      Your house's?

    _Ulr._                     When I'm worthy of it,                  190
    I'll answer you.

    _Stral._ (_aside_). Most probably an Austrian,
    Whom these unsettled times forbid to boast
    His lineage on these wild and dangerous frontiers,
    Where the name of his country is abhorred.
                                        [_Aloud to_ FRITZ _and_ IDENSTEIN.
    So, sirs! how have ye sped in your researches?

    _Iden._ Indifferent well, your Excellency.

    _Stral._                                   Then
    I am to deem the plunderer is caught?

    _Iden._ Humph!--not exactly.

    _Stral._                     Or, at least, suspected?

    _Iden._ Oh! for that matter, very much suspected.

    _Stral._ Who may he be?

    _Iden._                 Why, don't _you_ know, my Lord?            200

    _Stral._ How should I? I was fast asleep.

    _Iden._                                   And so
    Was I--and that's the cause I know no more
    Than does your Excellency.

    _Stral._                   Dolt!

    _Iden._                         Why, if
    Your Lordship, being robbed, don't recognise
    The rogue; how should I, not being robbed, identify
    The thief among so many? In the crowd,
    May it please your Excellency, your thief looks
    Exactly like the rest, or rather better:
    'Tis only at the bar and in the dungeon,
    That wise men know your felon by his features;                     210
    But I'll engage, that if seen there but once,
    Whether he be found criminal or no,
    His face shall be so.

    _Stral._ (_to_ FRITZ). Prithee, Fritz, inform me
    What hath been done to trace the fellow?

    _Fritz_.                                 Faith!
    My Lord, not much as yet, except conjecture.

    _Stral._ Besides the loss (which, I must own, affects me
    Just now materially), I needs would find
    The villain out of public motives; for
    So dexterous a spoiler, who could creep
    Through my attendants, and so many peopled                         220
    And lighted chambers, on my rest, and snatch
    The gold before my scarce-closed eyes, would soon
    Leave bare your borough, Sir Intendant!

    _Iden._                                True;
    If there were aught to carry off, my Lord.

    _Ulr._ What is all this?

    _Stral._                 You joined us but this morning,
    And have not heard that I was robbed last night.

    _Ulr._ Some rumour of it reached me as I passed
    The outer chambers of the palace, but
    I know no further.

    _Stral._           It is a strange business:
    The Intendant can inform you of the facts.                         230

    _Iden._ Most willingly. You see----

    _Stral._ (_impatiently_).          Defer your tale,
    Till certain of the hearer's patience.

    _Iden._                                That
    Can only be approved by proofs. You see----

    _Stral._ (_again interrupting him, and addressing_ ULRIC).
    In short, I was asleep upon my chair,
    My cabinet before me, with some gold
    Upon it (more than I much like to lose,
    Though in part only): some ingenious person
    Contrived to glide through all my own attendants,
    Besides those of the place, and bore away
    A hundred golden ducats, which to find                             240
    I would be fain, and there's an end. Perhaps
    You (as I still am rather faint) would add
    To yesterday's great obligation, this,
    Though slighter, yet not slight, to aid these men
    (Who seem but lukewarm) in recovering it?

    _Ulr._ Most willingly, and without loss of time--
    (_To_ IDENSTEIN.) Come hither, mynheer!

    _Iden._                               But so much haste bodes
    Right little speed, and----

    _Ulr._                      Standing motionless
    None; so let's march: we'll talk as we go on.

    _Iden._ But----

    _Ulr._          Show the spot, and then I'll answer you.           250

    _Fritz_. I will, sir, with his Excellency's leave.

    _Stral._ Do so, and take yon old ass with you.

    _Fritz_.                                       Hence!

    _Ulr._ Come on, old oracle, expound thy riddle!
                                       [_Exit with_ IDENSTEIN _and_ FRITZ.

    _Stral._ (_solus_). A stalwart, active, soldier-looking stripling,
    Handsome as Hercules ere his first labour,
    And with a brow of thought beyond his years
    When in repose, till his eye kindles up
    In answering yours. I wish I could engage him:
    I have need of some such spirits near me now,
    For this inheritance is worth a struggle.                          260
    And though I am not the man to yield without one,
    Neither are they who now rise up between me
    And my desire. The boy, they say, 's a bold one;
    But he hath played the truant in some hour
    Of freakish folly, leaving fortune to
    Champion his claims. That's well. The father, whom
    For years I've tracked, as does the blood-hound, never
    In sight, but constantly in scent, had put me
    To fault; but _here_ I _have_ him, and that's better.
    It must be _he_! All circumstance proclaims it;                    270
    And careless voices, knowing not the cause
    Of my enquiries, still confirm it.--Yes!
    The man, his bearing, and the mystery
    Of his arrival, and the time; the account, too,
    The Intendant gave (for I have not beheld her)
    Of his wife's dignified but foreign aspect;
    Besides the antipathy with which we met,
    As snakes and lions shrink back from each other
    By secret instinct that both must be foes
    Deadly, without being natural prey to either;                      280
    All--all--confirm it to my mind. However,
    We'll grapple, ne'ertheless. In a few hours
    The order comes from Frankfort, if these waters
    Rise not the higher (and the weather favours
    Their quick abatement), and I'll have him safe
    Within a dungeon, where he may avouch
    His real estate and name; and there's no harm done,
    Should he prove other than I deem. This robbery
    (Save for the actual loss) is lucky also;
    He's poor, and that's suspicious--he's unknown,                    290
    And that's defenceless.--True, we have no proofs
    Of guilt--but what hath he of innocence?
    Were he a man indifferent to my prospects,
    In other bearings, I should rather lay
    The inculpation on the Hungarian, who
    Hath something which I like not; and alone
    Of all around, except the Intendant, and
    The Prince's household and my own, had ingress
    Familiar to the chamber.

                              _Enter_ GABOR.

                            Friend, how fare you?

    _Gab._ As those who fare well everywhere, when they                300
    Have supped and slumbered, no great matter how--
    And you, my Lord?

    _Stral._          Better in rest than purse:
    Mine inn is like to cost me dear.

    _Gab._                           I heard
    Of your late loss; but 'tis a trifle to
    One of your order.

    _Stral._           You would hardly think so,
    Were the loss yours.

    _Gab._               I never had so much
    (At once) in my whole life, and therefore am not
    Fit to decide. But I came here to seek you.
    Your couriers are turned back--I have outstripped them,
    In my return.

    _Stral._      You!--Why?

    _Gab._                  I went at daybreak,                        310
    To watch for the abatement of the river,
    As being anxious to resume my journey.
    Your messengers were all checked like myself;
    And, seeing the case hopeless, I await
    The current's pleasure.

    _Stral._                Would the dogs were in it!
    Why did they not, at least, attempt the passage?
    I ordered this at all risks.

    _Gab._                       Could you order
    The Oder to divide, as Moses did
    The Red Sea (scarcely redder than the flood
    Of the swoln stream), and be obeyed, perhaps                       320
    They might have ventured.

    _Stral._                 I must see to it:
    The knaves! the slaves!--but they shall smart for this.
                                                      [_Exit_ STRALENHEIM.

    _Gab._ (_solus_). There goes my noble, feudal, self-willed Baron!
    Epitome of what brave chivalry
    The preux Chevaliers of the good old times
    Have left us. Yesterday he would have given
    His lands[175] (if he hath any), and, still dearer,
    His sixteen quarterings, for as much fresh air
    As would have filled a bladder, while he lay
    Gurgling and foaming half way through the window                   330
    Of his o'erset and water-logged conveyance;
    And now he storms at half a dozen wretches
    Because they love their lives too! Yet, he's right:
    'Tis strange they should, when such as he may put them
    To hazard at his pleasure. Oh, thou world!
    Thou art indeed a melancholy jest!                      [_Exit_ GABOR.


          SCENE II.--_The Apartment of_ WERNER, _in the Palace_.

                      _Enter_ JOSEPHINE _and_ ULRIC.

    _Jos._ Stand back, and let me look on thee again!
    My Ulric!--my beloved!--can it be--
    After twelve years?

    _Ulr._              My dearest mother!

    _Jos._                                Yes!
    My dream is realised--how beautiful!--
    How more than all I sighed for! Heaven receive
    A mother's thanks! a mother's tears of joy!
    This is indeed thy work!--At such an hour, too,
    He comes not only as a son, but saviour.

    _Ulr._ If such a joy await me, it must double
    What I now feel, and lighten from my heart                          10
    A part of the long debt of duty, not
    Of love (for that was ne'er withheld)--forgive me!
    This long delay was not my fault.

    _Jos._                            I know it,
    But cannot think of sorrow now, and doubt
    If I e'er felt it, 'tis so dazzled from
    My memory by this oblivious transport!--
    My son!

                             _Enter_ WERNER.

    _Wer._ What have we here,--more strangers?--

    _Jos._                                       No!
    Look upon him! What do you see?

    _Wer._                          A stripling,
    For the first time--

    _Ulr._ (_kneeling_). For twelve long years, my father!

    _Wer._ Oh, God!

    _Jos._          He faints!

    _Wer._                    No--I am better now--                     20
    Ulric! (_Embraces him_.)

    _Ulr._ My father, Siegendorf!

    _Wer._ (_starting_).          Hush! boy--
    The walls may hear that name!

    _Ulr._                        What then?

    _Wer._                                  Why, then--
    But we will talk of that anon. Remember,
    I must be known here but as Werner. Come!
    Come to my arms again! Why, thou look'st all
    I should have been, and was not. Josephine!
    Sure 'tis no father's fondness dazzles me;
    But, had I seen that form amid ten thousand
    Youth of the choicest, my heart would have chosen
    This for my son!

    _Ulr._           And yet you knew me not!                           30

    _Wer._ Alas! I have had that upon my soul
    Which makes me look on all men with an eye
    That only knows the evil at first glance.

    _Ulr._ My memory served me far more fondly: I
    Have not forgotten aught; and oft-times in
    The proud and princely halls of--(I'll not name them,
    As you say that 'tis perilous)--but i' the pomp
    Of your sire's feudal mansion, I looked back
    To the Bohemian mountains many a sunset,
    And wept to see another day go down                                 40
    O'er thee and me, with those huge hills between us.
    They shall not part us more.

    _Wer._                      I know not that.
    Are you aware my father is no more?

    _Ulr._ Oh, Heavens! I left him in a green old age,
    And looking like the oak, worn, but still steady
    Amidst the elements, whilst younger trees
    Fell fast around him. 'Twas scarce three months since.

    _Wer._ Why did you leave him?

    _Jos._ (_embracing_ ULRIC). Can you ask that question?
    Is he not _here_?

    _Wer._           True; he hath sought his parents,
    And found them; but, oh! _how_, and in what state!                  50

    _Ulr._ All shall be bettered. What we have to do
    Is to proceed, and to assert our rights,
    Or rather yours; for I waive all, unless
    Your father has disposed in such a sort
    Of his broad lands as to make mine the foremost,
    So that I must prefer my claim for form:
    But I trust better, and that all is yours.

    _Wer._ Have you not heard of Stralenheim?

    _Ulr._                                   I saved
    His life but yesterday: he's here.

    _Wer._                             You saved
    The serpent who will sting us all!

    _Ulr._                             You speak                        60
    Riddles: what is this Stralenheim to us?

    _Wer._ Every thing. One who claims our father's lands:
    Our distant kinsman, and our nearest foe.

    _Ulr._ I never heard his name till now. The Count,
    Indeed, spoke sometimes of a kinsman, who,
    If his own line should fail, might be remotely
    Involved in the succession; but his titles
    Were never named before me--and what then?
    His right must yield to ours.

    _Wer._                       Aye, if at Prague:
    But here he is all-powerful; and has spread                         70
    Snares for thy father, which, if hitherto
    He hath escaped them, is by fortune, not
    By favour.

    _Ulr._      Doth he personally know you?

    _Wer._ No; but he guesses shrewdly at my person,
    As he betrayed last night; and I, perhaps,
    But owe my temporary liberty
    To his uncertainty.

    _Ulr._             I think you wrong him
    (Excuse me for the phrase); but Stralenheim
    Is not what you prejudge him, or, if so,
    He owes me something both for past and present.                     80
    I saved his life, he therefore trusts in me.
    He hath been plundered too, since he came hither:
    Is sick, a stranger, and as such not now
    Able to trace the villain who hath robbed him:
    I have pledged myself to do so; and the business
    Which brought me here was chiefly that:[176] but I
    Have found, in searching for another's dross,
    My own whole treasure--you, my parents!

    _Wer._ (_agitatedly_).                  Who
    Taught you to mouth that name of "villain?"

    _Ulr._                                      What
    More noble name belongs to common thieves?                          90

    _Wer._ Who taught you thus to brand an unknown being
    With an infernal stigma?

    _Ulr._                  My own feelings
    Taught me to name a ruffian from his deeds.

    _Wer._ Who taught you, long-sought and ill-found boy! that
    It would be safe for my own son to insult me?

    _Ulr._ I named a villain. What is there in common
    With such a being and my father?

    _Wer._                          Every thing!
    That ruffian is thy father![177]

    _Jos._                      Oh, my son!
    Believe him not--and yet!--(_her voice falters_.)

    _Ulr._ (_starts, looks earnestly at_ WERNER
    _and then says slowly_) And you avow it?

    _Wer._ Ulric, before you dare despise your father,                 100
    Learn to divine and judge his actions. Young,
    Rash, new to life, and reared in Luxury's lap,
    Is it for you to measure Passion's force,
    Or Misery's temptation? Wait--(not long,
    It cometh like the night, and quickly)--Wait!--
    Wait till, like me, your hopes are blighted[178] till
    Sorrow and Shame are handmaids of your cabin--
    Famine and Poverty your guests at table;
    Despair your bed-fellow--then rise, but not
    From sleep, and judge! Should that day e'er arrive--               110
    Should you see then the Serpent, who hath coiled
    Himself around all that is dear and noble
    Of you and yours, lie slumbering in your path,
    With but _his_ folds between your steps and happiness,
    When _he_, who lives but to tear from you name,
    Lands, life itself, lies at your mercy, with
    Chance your conductor--midnight for your mantle--
    The bare knife in your hand, and earth asleep,
    Even to your deadliest foe; and he as 'twere
    Inviting death, by looking like it, while                          120
    His death alone can save you:--Thank your God!
    If then, like me, content with petty plunder,
    You turn aside----I did so.

    _Ulr._                     But----

    _Wer._ (_abruptly_).              Hear me!
    I will not brook a human voice--scarce dare
    Listen to my own (if that be human still)--
    Hear me! you do not know this man--I do.[179]
    He's mean, deceitful, avaricious. You
    Deem yourself safe, as young and brave; but learn
    None are secure from desperation, few
    From subtilty. My worst foe, Stralenheim,                          130
    Housed in a Prince's palace, couched within
    A Prince's chamber, lay below my knife!
    An instant--a mere motion--the least impulse--
    Had swept him and all fears of mine from earth.
    He was within my power--my knife was raised--
    Withdrawn--and I'm in his:--are you not so?
    Who tells you that he knows you _not?_ Who says
    He hath not lured you here to end you? or
    To plunge you, with your parents, in a dungeon?
                                                             [_He pauses_.

    _Ulr._ Proceed--proceed!

    _Wer._                  _Me_ he hath ever known,                   140
    And hunted through each change of time--name--fortune--
    And why not _you?_ Are you more versed in men?
    He wound snares round me; flung along my path
    Reptiles, whom, in my youth, I would have spurned
    Even from my presence; but, in spurning now,
    Fill only with fresh venom. Will you be
    More patient? Ulric!--Ulric!--there are crimes
    Made venial by the occasion, and temptations
    Which nature cannot master or forbear.[180]

    _Ulr._ (_who looks first at him and then at_ JOSEPHINE).
    My mother!

    _Wer._     Ah! I thought so: you have now                          150
    Only one parent. I have lost alike
    Father and son, and stand alone.

    _Ulr._                          But stay!
                                      [WERNER _rushes out of the chamber_.

    _Jos._ (_to_ ULRIC). Follow him not, until this storm of passion
    Abates. Think'st thou, that were it well for him,
    I had not followed?

    _Ulr._             I obey you, mother,
    Although reluctantly. My first act shall not
    Be one of disobedience.

    _Jos._                  Oh! he is good!
    Condemn him not from his own mouth, but trust
    To me, who have borne so much with him, and for him,
    That this is but the surface of his soul,                          160
    And that the depth is rich in better things.

    _Ulr._ These then are but my father's principles[181]?
    My mother thinks not with him?

    _Jos._                         Nor doth he
    Think as he speaks. Alas! long years of grief
    Have made him sometimes thus.

    _Ulr._                        Explain to me
    More clearly, then, these claims of Stralenheim,
    That, when I see the subject in its bearings,
    I may prepare to face him, or at least
    To extricate you from your present perils.
    I pledge myself to accomplish this--but would                      170
    I had arrived a few hours sooner!

    _Jos._                            Aye!
    Hadst thou but done so!

            _Enter_ GABOR _and_ IDENSTEIN, _with Attendants_.

    _Gab._ (_to_ ULRIC).   I have sought you, comrade.
    So this is my reward!

    _Ulr._                What do you mean?

    _Gab._ 'Sdeath! have I lived to these years, and for this!
    (_To_ IDENSTEIN.) But for your age and folly, I would----

    _Iden._                                                   Help!
    Hands off! Touch an Intendant!

    _Gab._                        Do not think
    I'll honour you so much as save your throat
    From the Ravenstone[182] by choking you myself.

    _Iden._ I thank you for the respite: but there are
    Those who have greater need of it than me.                         180

    _Ulr._ Unriddle this vile wrangling, or----

    _Gab._                                      At once, then,
    The Baron has been robbed, and upon me
    This worthy personage has deigned to fix
    His kind suspicions--me! whom he ne'er saw
    Till yester evening.

    _Iden._              Wouldst have me suspect
    My own acquaintances? You have to learn
    That I keep better company.

    _Gab._                     You shall
    Keep the best shortly, and the last for all men,
    The worms! You hound of malice!
                                                   [GABOR _seizes on him_.

    _Ulr._ (_interfering_).         Nay, no violence:
    He's old, unarmed--be temperate, Gabor!

    _Gab._ (_letting go_ IDENSTEIN).       True:                       190
    I am a fool to lose myself because
    Fools deem me knave: it is their homage.

    _Ulr._ (_to_ IDENSTEIN).                 How
    Fare you?

    _Iden._    Help!

    _Ulr._         I _have_ helped you.

    _Iden._                            Kill him! then
    I'll say so.

    _Gab._        I am calm--live on!

    _Iden._                          That's more
    Than you shall do, if there be judge or judgment
    In Germany. The Baron shall decide!

    _Gab._ Does _he_ abet you in your accusation?

    _Iden._ Does he not?

    _Gab._              Then next time let him go sink
    Ere I go hang for snatching him from drowning.
    But here he comes!

                           _Enter_ STRALENHEIM.

    _Gab._ (_goes up to him_). My noble Lord, I'm here!                200

    _Stral._ Well, sir!

    _Gab._              Have you aught with me?

    _Stral._                                   What should I
    Have with you?

    _Gab._        You know best, if yesterday's
    Flood has not washed away your memory;
    But that's a trifle. I stand here accused,
    In phrases not equivocal, by yon
    Intendant, of the pillage of your person
    Or chamber:--is the charge your own or his?

    _Stral._ I accuse no man.

    _Gab._                    Then you acquit me, Baron?

    _Stral._ I know not whom to accuse, or to acquit,
    Or scarcely to suspect.

    _Gab._                  But you at least                           210
    Should know whom _not_ to suspect. I am insulted--
    Oppressed here by these menials, and I look
    To you for remedy--teach them their duty!
    To look for thieves at home were part of it,
    If duly taught; but, in one word, if I
    Have an accuser, let it be a man
    Worthy to be so of a man like me.
    I am your equal.

    _Stral._         You!

    _Gab._               Aye, sir; and, for
    Aught that you know, superior; but proceed--
    I do not ask for hints, and surmises,                              220
    And circumstance, and proof: I know enough
    Of what I have done for you, and what you owe me,
    To have at least waited your payment rather
    Than paid myself, had I been eager of
    Your gold. I also know, that were I even
    The villain I am deemed, the service rendered
    So recently would not permit you to
    Pursue me to the death, except through shame,
    Such as would leave your scutcheon but a blank.
    But this is nothing: I demand of you                               230
    Justice upon your unjust servants, and
    From your own lips a disavowal of
    All sanction of their insolence: thus much
    You owe to the unknown, who asks no more,
    And never thought to have asked so much.

    _Stral._                                This tone
    May be of innocence.

    _Gab._              'Sdeath! who dare doubt it,
    Except such villains as ne'er had it?

    _Stral._                              You
    Are hot, sir.

    _Gab._        Must I turn an icicle
    Before the breath of menials, and their master[cr]?

    _Stral._ Ulric! you know this man; I found him in                  240
    _Your_ company.

    _Gab._         We found _you_ in the Oder;
    Would we had left you there!

    _Stral._                    I give you thanks, sir.

    _Gab._ I've earned them; but might have earned more from others,
    Perchance, if I had left you to your fate.

    _Stral._ Ulric! you know this man?

    _Gab._                             No more than you do
    If he avouches not my honour.

    _Ulr._                        I
    Can vouch your courage, and, as far as my
    Own brief connection led me, honour.

    _Stral._                             Then
    I'm satisfied.

    _Gab._ (_ironically_). Right easily, methinks.
    What is the spell in his asseveration                              250
    More than in mine?

    _Stral._          I merely said that _I_
    Was satisfied--not that you are absolved.

    _Gab._ Again! Am I accused or no?

    _Stral._                          Go to!
    You wax too insolent. If circumstance
    And general suspicion be against you,
    Is the fault mine? Is't not enough that I
    Decline all question of your guilt or innocence?

    _Gab._ My Lord, my Lord, this is mere cozenage[183],
    A vile equivocation; you well know
    Your doubts are certainties to all around you--                    260
    Your looks a voice--your frowns a sentence; you
    Are practising your power on me--because
    You have it; but beware! you know not whom
    You strive to tread on.

    _Stral._               Threat'st thou?

    _Gab._                                Not so much
    As you accuse. You hint the basest injury,
    And I retort it with an open warning.

    _Stral._ As you have said, 'tis true I owe you something,
    For which you seem disposed to pay yourself.

    _Gab._ Not with your gold.

    _Stral._                   With bootless insolence.
                                       [_To his Attendants and_ IDENSTEIN.
    You need not further to molest this man,                           270
    But let him go his way. Ulric, good morrow!
                         [_Exit_ STRALENHEIM, IDENSTEIN, _and Attendants_.

    _Gab._ (_following_). I'll after him and----

    _Ulr._ (_stopping him_).                    Not a step.

    _Gab._                                                 Who shall
    Oppose me?

    _Ulr._    Your own reason, with a moment's
    Thought.

    _Gab._   Must I bear this?

    _Ulr._                   Pshaw! we all must bear
    The arrogance of something higher than
    Ourselves--the highest cannot temper Satan,
    Nor the lowest his vicegerents upon earth.
    I've seen you brave the elements, and bear
    Things which had made this silkworm[184] cast his skin--
    And shrink you from a few sharp sneers and words?                  280

    _Gab._ Must I bear to be deemed a thief? If 'twere
    A bandit of the woods, I could have borne it--
    There's something daring in it:--but to steal
    The moneys of a slumbering man!--

    _Ulr._                            It seems, then,
    You are _not_ guilty.

    _Gab._                Do I hear aright?
    _You_ too!

    _Ulr._     I merely asked a simple question.

    _Gab._ If the judge asked me, I would answer "No"--
    To you I answer _thus_.                                   [_He draws_.

    _Ulr._ (_drawing_).     With all my heart!

    _Jos._ Without there! Ho! help! help!--Oh, God!
    here's murder!                         [_Exit_ JOSEPHINE, _shrieking_.

          GABOR _and_ ULRIC _fight_. GABOR _is disarmed just as_
           STRALENHEIM, JOSEPHINE, IDENSTEIN, _etc., re-enter_.

    _Jos._ Oh! glorious Heaven! He's safe!

    _Stral._ (_to_ JOSEPHINE).           _Who's_ safe!

    _Jos._                                            My----

    _Ulr._ (_interrupting her with a stern look, and turning
    afterwards to_ STRALENHEIM).                            Both!      290
    Here's no great harm done.

    _Stral._                  What hath caused all this?

    _Ulr._ _You_, Baron, I believe; but as the effect
    Is harmless, let it not disturb you.--Gabor!
    There is your sword; and when you bare it next,
    Let it not be against your _friends_.

                 [ULRIC _pronounces the last words slowly and emphatically
                         in a low voice to_ GABOR.

    _Gab._                               I thank you
    Less for my life than for your counsel.

    _Stral._                                These
    Brawls must end here.

    _Gab._ (_taking his sword_). They _shall_. You've wronged me, Ulric,
    More with your unkind thoughts than sword: I would
    The last were in my bosom rather than
    The first in yours. I could have borne yon noble's                 300
    Absurd insinuations--ignorance
    And dull suspicion are a part of his
    Entail will last him longer than his lands--
    But I may fit _him_ yet:--you have vanquished me.
    I was the fool of passion to conceive
    That I could cope with you, whom I had seen
    Already proved by greater perils than
    Rest in this arm. We may meet by and by,
    However--but in friendship.                             [_Exit_ GABOR.

    _Stral._                    I will brook
    No more! This outrage following upon his insults,                  310
    Perhaps his guilt, has cancelled all the little
    I owed him heretofore for the so-vaunted
    Aid which he added to your abler succour.
    Ulric, you are not hurt?--

    _Ulr._                     Not even by a scratch.

    _Stral._ (_to_ IDENSTEIN). Intendant! take your measures to secure
    Yon fellow: I revoke my former lenity.
    He shall be sent to Frankfort with an escort,
    The instant that the waters have abated.

    _Iden._ Secure him! He hath got his sword again----
    And seems to know the use on't; 'tis his trade,                    320
    Belike;--_I'm_ a civilian.

    _Stral._                   Fool! are not
    Yon score of vassals dogging at your heels
    Enough to seize a dozen such? Hence! after him!

    _Ulr._ Baron, I do beseech you!

    _Stral._                        I must be
    Obeyed. No words!

    _Iden._           Well, if it must be so--
    March, vassals! I'm your leader, and will bring
    The rear up: a wise general never should
    Expose his precious life--on which all rests.
    I like that article of war.
                                       [_Exit_ IDENSTEIN _and Attendants_.

    _Stral._                    Come hither,
    Ulric; what does that woman here? Oh! now                          330
    I recognise her, 'tis the stranger's wife
    Whom they _name_ "Werner."

    _Ulr._                    'Tis his name.

    _Stral._                                Indeed!
    Is not your husband visible, fair dame?--

    _Jos._ Who seeks him?

    _Stral._             No one--for the present: but
    I fain would parley, Ulric, with yourself
    Alone.

    _Ulr._ I will retire with you.

    _Jos._                         Not so:
    You are the latest stranger, and command
    All places here.
    (_Aside to_ ULRIC, _as she goes out_.) O Ulric! have a care--
    Remember what depends on a rash word!

    _Ulr._ (_to_ JOSEPHINE).            Fear not!--
                                                        [_Exit_ JOSEPHINE.

    _Stral._ Ulric, I think that I may trust you;                      340
    You saved my life--and acts like these beget
    Unbounded confidence.

    _Ulr._                Say on.

    _Stral._                     Mysterious
    And long-engendered circumstances (not
    To be now fully entered on) have made
    This man obnoxious--perhaps fatal to me.

    _Ulr._ Who? Gabor, the Hungarian?

    _Stral._                         No--this "Werner"--
    With the false name and habit.

    _Ulr._                       How can this be?
    He is the poorest of the poor--and yellow
    Sickness sits caverned in his hollow eye[cs]:
    The man is helpless.

    _Stral._            He is--'tis no matter;--                       350
    But if he be the man I deem (and that
    He is so, all around us here--and much
    That is not here--confirm my apprehension)
    He must be made secure ere twelve hours further.

    _Ulr._ And what have I to do with this?

    _Stral._                                I have sent
    To Frankfort, to the Governor, my friend,
    (I have the authority to do so by
    An order of the house of Brandenburgh),
    For a fit escort--but this cursed flood
    Bars all access, and may do for some hours.                        360

    _Ulr._ It is abating.

    _Stral._              That is well.

    _Ulr._                             But how
    Am I concerned?

    _Stral._        As one who did so much
    For me, you cannot be indifferent to
    That which is of more import to me than
    The life you rescued.--Keep your eye on _him_!
    The man avoids me, knows that I now know him.--
    Watch him!--as you would watch the wild boar when
    He makes against you in the hunter's gap--
    Like him he must be speared.

    _Ulr._                       Why so?

    _Stral._                            He stands
    Between me and a brave inheritance!                                370
    Oh! could you see it! But you shall.

    _Ulr._                               I hope so.

    _Stral._ It is the richest of the rich Bohemia,
    Unscathed by scorching war. It lies so near
    The strongest city, Prague, that fire and sword
    Have skimmed it lightly: so that now, besides
    Its own exuberance, it bears double value
    Confronted with whole realms far and near
    Made deserts.

    _Ulr._       You describe it faithfully.

    _Stral._ Aye--could you see it, you would say so--but,
    As I have said, you shall.

    _Ulr._                     I accept the omen.                      380

    _Stral._ Then claim a recompense from it and me,
    Such as _both_ may make worthy your acceptance
    And services to me and mine for ever.

    _Ulr._ And this sole, sick, and miserable wretch--
    This way-worn stranger--stands between you and
    This Paradise?--(As Adam did between
    The devil and his)--[_Aside_].

    _Stral._                      He doth.

    _Ulr._                               Hath he no right?

    _Stral._ Right! none. A disinherited prodigal,
    Who for these twenty years disgraced his lineage
    In all his acts--but chiefly by his marriage,                      390
    And living amidst commerce-fetching burghers,
    And dabbling merchants, in a mart of Jews.

    _Ulr._ He has a wife, then?

    _Stral._                    You'd be sorry to
    Call such your mother. You have seen the woman
    He _calls_ his wife.

    _Ulr._               Is she not so?

    _Stral._                           No more
    Than he's your father:--an Italian girl,
    The daughter of a banished man, who lives
    On love and poverty with this same Werner.

    _Ulr._ They are childless, then?

    _Stral._                        There is or was a bastard,
    Whom the old man--the grandsire (as old age                        400
    Is ever doting) took to warm his bosom,
    As it went chilly downward to the grave:
    But the imp stands not in my path--he has fled,
    No one knows whither; and if he had not,
    His claims alone were too contemptible
    To stand.--Why do you smile?

    _Ulr._                      At your vain fears:
    A poor man almost in his grasp--a child
    Of doubtful birth--can startle a grandee!

    _Stral._ All's to be feared, where all is to be gained.

    _Ulr._ True; and aught done to save or to obtain it.               410

    _Stral._ You have harped the very string next to my heart[185].
    I may depend upon you?

    _Ulr._                'Twere too late
    To doubt it.

    _Stral._ Let no foolish pity shake
    Your bosom (for the appearance of the man
    Is pitiful)--he is a wretch, as likely
    To have robbed me as the fellow more suspected,
    Except that circumstance is less against him;
    He being lodged far off, and in a chamber
    Without approach to mine; and, to say truth,
    I think too well of blood allied to mine,                          420
    To deem he would descend to such an act:
    Besides, he was a soldier, and a brave one
    Once--though too rash.

    _Ulr._                And they, my Lord, we know
    By our experience, never plunder till
    They knock the brains out first--which makes them heirs,
    Not thieves. The dead, who feel nought, can lose nothing,
    Nor e'er be robbed: their spoils are a bequest--
    No more.

    _Stral._ Go to! you are a wag. But say
    I may be sure you'll keep an eye on this man,
    And let me know his slightest movement towards                     430
    Concealment or escape.

    _Ulr._                You may be sure
    You yourself could not watch him more than I
    Will be his sentinel.

    _Stral._             By this you make me
    Yours, and for ever.

    _Ulr._               Such is my intention.                  [_Exeunt_.




                                 ACT III.

          SCENE I.--_A Hall in the same Palace, from whence the
                          secret Passage leads_.

                       _Enter_ WERNER _and_ GABOR.

    _Gab._ Sir, I have told my tale: if it so please you
    To give me refuge for a few hours, well--
    If not, I'll try my fortune elsewhere.

    _Wer._                                 How
    Can I, so wretched, give to Misery
    A shelter?--wanting such myself as much
    As e'er the hunted deer a covert----

    _Gab._                               Or
    The wounded lion his cool cave. Methinks
    You rather look like one would turn at bay,
    And rip the hunter's entrails.

    _Wer._                         Ah!

    _Gab._                            I care not
    If it be so, being much disposed to do                              10
    The same myself. But will you shelter me?
    I am oppressed like you--and poor like you--
    Disgraced----

    _Wer._ (_abruptly_). Who told you that I was disgraced?

    _Gab._ No one; nor did I say _you_ were so: with
    Your poverty my likeness ended; but
    I said _I_ was so--and would add, with truth,
    As undeservedly as _you_.

    _Wer._                    Again!
    As _I_?

    _Gab._ Or any other honest man.
    What the devil would you have? You don't believe me
    Guilty of this base theft?

    _Wer._                     No, no--I cannot.                        20

    _Gab._ Why that's my heart of honour! yon young gallant--
    Your miserly Intendant and dense noble--
    All--all suspected me; and why? because
    I am the worst clothed, and least named amongst them;
    Although, were Momus'[186] lattice in your breasts,
    My soul might brook to open it more widely
    Than theirs: but thus it is--you poor and helpless--
    Both still more than myself.

    _Wer._                      How know you that?

    _Gab._ You're right: I ask for shelter at the hand
    Which I call helpless; if you now deny it,                          30
    I were well paid. But you, who seem to have proved
    The wholesome bitterness of life, know well,
    By sympathy, that all the outspread gold
    Of the New World the Spaniard boasts about
    Could never tempt the man who knows its worth,
    Weighed at its proper value in the balance,
    Save in such guise (and there I grant its power,
    Because I feel it,) as may leave no nightmare
    Upon his heart o' nights.

    _Wer._                    What do you mean?

    _Gab._ Just what I say; I thought my speech was plain:              40
    You are no thief--nor I--and, as true men,
    Should aid each other.

    _Wer._                 It is a damned world, sir.

    _Gab._ So is the nearest of the two next, as
    The priests say (and no doubt they should know best),
    Therefore I'll stick by this--as being both
    To suffer martyrdom, at least with such
    An epitaph as larceny upon my tomb.
    It is but a night's lodging which I crave;
    To-morrow I will try the waters, as
    The dove did--trusting that they have abated.                       50

    _Wer._ Abated? Is there hope of that?

    _Gab._                                There was
    At noontide.

    _Wer._       Then we may be safe.

    _Gab._                           Are _you_
    In peril?

    _Wer._    Poverty is ever so.

    _Gab._ That I know by long practice. Will you not
    Promise to make mine less?

    _Wer._                     Your poverty?

    _Gab._ No--you don't look a leech for that disorder;
    I meant my peril only: you've a roof,
    And I have none; I merely seek a covert.

    _Wer._ Rightly; for how should such a wretch as I
    Have gold?

    _Gab._    Scarce honestly, to say the truth on't,                   60
    Although I almost wish you had the Baron's.

    _Wer._ Dare you insinuate?

    _Gab._                     What?

    _Wer._                          Are you aware
    To whom you speak?

    _Gab._             No; and I am not used
    Greatly to care. (_A noise heard without_.) But hark! they come!

    _Wer._                                                  Who come?

    _Gab._ The Intendant and his man-hounds after me:
    I'd face them--but it were in vain to expect
    Justice at hands like theirs. Where shall I go?
    But show me any place. I do assure you,
    If there be faith in man, I am most guiltless:
    Think if it were your own case!

    _Wer._ (_aside_).              Oh, just God!                        70
    Thy hell is not hereafter! Am I dust still?

    _Gab._ I see you're moved; and it shows well in you:
    I may live to requite it.

    _Wer._                    Are you not
    A spy of Stralenheim's?

    _Gab._                   Not I! and if
    I were, what is there to espy in you?
    Although, I recollect, his frequent question
    About you and your spouse might lead to some
    Suspicion; but you best know--what--and why.
    I am his deadliest foe.

    _Wer._                   _You?_

    _Gab._                         After such
    A treatment for the service which in part                           80
    I rendered him, I am his enemy:
    If you are not his friend you will assist me.

    _Wer._ I will.

    _Gab._         But how?

    _Wer._ (_showing the panel_). There is a secret spring:
    Remember, I discovered it by chance,
    And used it but for safety.

    _Gab._                     Open it,
    And I will use it for the same.

    _Wer._                          I found it,
    As I have said: it leads through winding walls,
    (So thick as to bear paths within their ribs,
    Yet lose no jot of strength or stateliness,)
    And hollow cells, and obscure niches, to                            90
    I know not whither; you must not advance:
    Give me your word.

    _Gab._             It is unecessary:
    How should I make my way in darkness through
    A Gothic labyrinth of unknown windings?

    _Wer._ Yes, but who knows to what place it may lead?
    _I_ know not--(mark you!)--but who knows it might not
    Lead even into the chamber of your foe?
    So strangely were contrived these galleries
    By our Teutonic fathers in old days,
    When man built less against the elements                           100
    Than his next neighbour. You must not advance
    Beyond the two first windings; if you do
    (Albeit I never passed them,) I'll not answer
    For what you may be led to.

    _Gab._                      But I will.
    A thousand thanks!

    _Wer._             You'll find the spring more obvious
    On the other side; and, when you would return,
    It yields to the least touch.

    _Gab._                        I'll in--farewell!
                                     [GABOR _goes in by the secret panel_.

    _Wer._ (_solus_). What have I done? Alas! what _had_ I done
    Before to make this fearful? Let it be
    Still some atonement that I save the man,                          110
    Whose sacrifice had saved perhaps my own--
    They come! to seek elsewhere what is before them!

                     _Enter_ IDENSTEIN _and Others_.

    _Iden._ Is he not here? He must have vanished then
    Through the dim Gothic glass by pious aid
    Of pictured saints upon the red and yellow
    Casements, through which the sunset streams like sunrise
    On long pearl-coloured beards and crimson crosses.
    And gilded crosiers, and crossed arms, and cowls,
    And helms, and twisted armour, and long swords,
    All the fantastic furniture of windows                             120
    Dim with brave knights and holy hermits, whose
    Likeness and fame alike rest in some panes
    Of crystal, which each rattling wind proclaims
    As frail as any other life or glory.
    He's gone, however.

    _Wer._              Whom do you seek?

    _Iden._                              A villain.

    _Wer._ Why need you come so far, then?

    _Iden._                               In the search
    Of him who robbed the Baron.

    _Wer._                       Are you sure
    You have divined the man?

    _Iden._                   As sure as you
    Stand there: but where's he gone?

    _Wer._                            Who?

    _Iden._                               He we sought.

    _Wer._ You see he is not here.

    _Iden._                        And yet we traced him               130
    Up to this hall. Are you accomplices?
    Or deal you in the black art?

    _Wer._                        I deal plainly,
    To many men the blackest.

    _Iden._                   It may be
    I have a question or two for yourself
    Hereafter; but we must continue now
    Our search for t'other.

    _Wer._                  You had best begin
    Your inquisition now: I may not be
    So patient always.

    _Iden._            I should like to know,
    In good sooth, if you really are the man
    That Stralenheim's in quest of.

    _Wer._                          Insolent!                          140
    Said you not that he was not here?

    _Iden._                           Yes, _one_;
    But there's another whom he tracks more keenly,
    And soon, it may be, with authority
    Both paramount to his and mine. But come!
    Bustle, my boys! we are at fault.
                                       [_Exit_ IDENSTEIN _and Attendants_.

    _Wer._                            In what
    A maze hath my dim destiny involved me!
    And one base sin hath done me less ill than
    The leaving undone one far greater. Down,
    Thou busy devil, rising in my heart!
    Thou art too late! I'll nought to do with blood.                   150

                              _Enter_ ULRIC.

    _Ulr._ I sought you, father.

    _Wer._                       Is't not dangerous?

    _Ulr._ No; Stralenheim is ignorant of all
    Or any of the ties between us: more--
    He sends me here a spy upon your actions,
    Deeming me wholly his.

    _Wer._                 I cannot think it:
    'Tis but a snare he winds about us both,
    To swoop the sire and son at once.

    _Ulr._                             I cannot
    Pause in each petty fear, and stumble at
    The doubts that rise like briers in our path,
    But must break through them, as an unarmed carle                   160
    Would, though with naked limbs, were the wolf rustling
    In the same thicket where he hewed for bread.
    Nets are for thrushes, eagles are not caught so:
    We'll overfly or rend them.

    _Wer._                      Show me _how?_

    _Ulr._ Can you not guess?

    _Wer._                    I cannot.

    _Ulr._                            That is strange.
    Came the thought ne'er into your mind _last night_?

    _Wer._ I understand you not.

    _Ulr._                      Then we shall never
    More understand each other. But to change
    The topic----

    _Wer._        You mean to _pursue_ it, as
    'Tis of our safety.

    _Ulr._              Right; I stand corrected.                      170
    I see the subject now more clearly, and
    Our general situation in its bearings.
    The waters are abating; a few hours
    Will bring his summoned myrmidons from Frankfort,
    When you will be a prisoner, perhaps worse,
    And I an outcast, bastardised by practice
    Of this same Baron to make way for him.

    _Wer._ And now your remedy! I thought to escape
    By means of this accursed gold; but now
    I dare not use it, show it, scarce look on it.                     180
    Methinks it wears upon its face my guilt
    For motto, not the mintage of the state;
    And, for the sovereign's head, my own begirt
    With hissing snakes, which curl around my temples,
    And cry to all beholders, Lo! a villain!

    _Ulr._ You must not use it, at least now; but take
    This ring.                               [_He gives_ WERNER _a jewel_.

    _Wer._     A gem! It was my father's!

    _Ulr._                               And
    As such is now your own. With this you must
    Bribe the Intendant for his old caleche
    And horses to pursue your route at sunrise,                        190
    Together with my mother.

    _Wer._                   And leave you,
    So lately found, in peril too?

    _Ulr._                         Fear nothing!
    The only fear were if we fled together,
    For that would make our ties beyond all doubt.
    The waters only lie in flood between
    This burgh and Frankfort: so far's in our favour
    The route on to Bohemia, though encumbered,
    Is not impassable; and when you gain
    A few hours' start, the difficulties will be
    The same to your pursuers. Once beyond                             200
    The frontier, and you're safe.

    _Wer._                         My noble boy!

    _Ulr._ Hush! hush! no transports: we'll indulge in them
    In Castle Siegendorf! Display no gold:
    Show Idenstein the gem (I know the man,
    And have looked through him): it will answer thus
    A double purpose. Stralenheim lost _gold_--
    _No_ jewel: therefore it could _not_ be his;
    And then the man who was possest of this
    Can hardly be suspected of abstracting
    The Baron's coin, when he could thus convert                       210
    This ring to more than Stralenheim has lost
    By his last night's slumber. Be not over timid
    In your address, nor yet too arrogant,
    And Idenstein will serve you.

    _Wer._                        I will follow
    In all things your direction.

    _Ulr._                       I would have
    Spared you the trouble; but had I appeared
    To take an interest in you, and still more
    By dabbling with a jewel in your favour,
    All had been known at once.

    _Wer._                      My guardian angel!
    This overpays the past. But how wilt thou                          220
    Fare in our absence?

    _Ulr._                Stralenheim knows nothing
    Of me as aught of kindred with yourself.
    I will but wait a day or two with him
    To lull all doubts, and then rejoin my father.

    _Wer._ To part no more!

    _Ulr._                  I know not that; but at
    The least we'll meet again once more.

    _Wer._                                My boy!
    My friend! my only child, and sole preserver!
    Oh, do not hate me!

    _Ulr._             Hate my father!

    _Wer._                            Aye,
    My father hated me. Why not my son?

    _Ulr._ Your father knew you not as I do.

    _Wer._                                   Scorpions                 230
    Are in thy words! Thou know me? in this guise
    Thou canst not know me, I am not myself;
    Yet (hate me not) I will be soon.

    _Ulr._                            I'll _wait!_
    In the mean time be sure that all a son
    Can do for parents shall be done for mine.

    _Wer._ I see it, and I feel it; yet I feel
    Further--that you despise me.

    _Ulr._                        Wherefore should I?

    _Wer._ Must I repeat my humiliation?

    _Ulr._                                No!
    I have fathomed it and you. But let us talk
    Of this no more. Or, if it must be ever,                           240
    Not _now_. Your error has redoubled all
    The present difficulties of our house
    At secret war with that of Stralenheim:
    All we have now to think of is to baffle
    HIM. I have shown _one_ way.

    _Wer._                      The only one,
    And I embrace it, as I did my son,
    Who showed _himself_ and father's _safety_ in
    One day.

    _Ulr._   You _shall_ be safe; let that suffice.
    Would Stralenheim's appearance in Bohemia
    Disturb your right, or mine, if once we were                       250
    Admitted to our lands?

    _Wer._                  Assuredly,
    Situate as we are now; although the first
    Possessor might, as usual, prove the strongest--
    Especially the next in blood.

    _Ulr._                        _Blood_! 'tis
    A word of many meanings; in the veins,
    And out of them, it is a different thing--
    And so it should be, when the same in blood
    (As it is called) are aliens to each other,
    Like Theban brethren:[187] when a part is bad,
    A few spilt ounces purify the rest.                                260

    _Wer._ I do not apprehend you.

    _Ulr._                         That may be--
    And should, perhaps--and yet--but get ye ready;
    You and my mother must away to-night.
    Here comes the Intendant: sound him with the gem;
    'Twill sink into his venal soul like lead
    Into the deep, and bring up slime and mud,
    And ooze, too, from the bottom, as the lead doth
    With its greased understratum;[188] but no less
    Will serve to warn our vessels through these shoals.
    The freight is rich, so heave the line in time!                    270
    Farewell! I scarce have time, but yet your _hand_,
    My father!----

    _Wer._         Let me embrace thee!

    _Ulr._                             We may be
    Observed: subdue your nature to the hour!
    Keep off from me as from your foe!

    _Wer._                            Accursed
    Be he who is the stifling cause which smothers
    The best and sweetest feeling of our hearts;
    At such an hour too!

    _Ulr._              Yes, curse--it will ease you!
    Here is the Intendant.

                            _Enter_ IDENSTEIN.

    _Ulr._                 Master Idenstein,
    How fare you in your purpose? Have you caught
    The rogue?

    _Iden._     No, faith!

    _Ulr._                Well, there are plenty more:                 280
    You may have better luck another chase.
    Where is the Baron?

    _Iden._             Gone back to his chamber:
    And now I think on't, asking after you
    With nobly-born impatience.

    _Ulr._                     Your great men
    Must be answered on the instant, as the bound
    Of the stung steed replies unto the spur:
    'Tis well they have horses, too; for if they had not,
    I fear that men must draw their chariots, as
    They say kings did Sesostris[189].

    _Iden._                        Who was he?

    _Ulr._ An old Bohemian--an imperial gipsy.                         290

    _Iden._ A gipsy or Bohemian, 'tis the same,
    For they pass by both names. And was he one?

    _Ulr._ I've heard so; but I must take leave. Intendant,
    Your servant!--Werner (_to_ WERNER _slightly_), if that be your name,
    Yours.                                                  [_Exit_ ULRIC.

    _Iden._ A well-spoken, pretty-faced young man!
    And prettily behaved! He knows his station,
    You see, sir: how he gave to each his due
    Precedence!

    _Wer._      I perceived it, and applaud
    His just discernment and your own.

    _Iden._                            That's well--
    That's very well. You also know your place, too;                   300
    And yet I don't know that _I_ know your place.

    _Wer._ (_showing the ring_).
    Would this assist your knowledge?

    _Iden._                           How!--What!--Eh!
    A jewel!

    _Wer._   'Tis your own on one condition.

    _Iden._ Mine!--Name it!

    _Wer._                  That hereafter you permit me
    At thrice its value to redeem it: 'tis
    A family ring.

    _Iden._        A family!--_yours!_--a gem!
    I'm breathless!

    _Wer._          You must also furnish me,
    An hour ere daybreak, with all means to quit
    This place.

    _Iden._      But is it real? Let me look on it:
    _Diamond_, by all that's glorious!

    _Wer._                             Come, I'll trust you:           310
    You have guessed, no doubt, that I was born above
    My present seeming.

    _Iden._            I can't say I did,
    Though this looks like it: this is the true breeding
    Of gentle blood!

    _Wer._           I have important reasons
    For wishing to continue privily
    My journey hence.

    _Iden._           So then _you are_ the man
    Whom Stralenheim's in quest of?

    _Wer._                          I am not;
    But being taken for him might conduct
    So much embarrassment to me just now,
    And to the Baron's self hereafter--'tis                            320
    To spare both that I would avoid all bustle.

    _Iden._ Be you the man or no, 'tis not my business;
    Besides, I never could obtain the half
    From this proud, niggardly noble, who would raise
    The country for some missing bits of coin,
    And never offer a precise reward--[ct]
    But _this!_--another look!

    _Wer._                     Gaze on it freely;
    At day-dawn it is yours.

    _Iden._                  Oh, thou sweet sparkler!
    Thou more than stone of the philosopher!
    Thou touch-stone of Philosophy herself!                            330
    Thou bright eye of the Mine! thou loadstar of
    The soul! the true magnetic Pole to which
    All hearts point duly north, like trembling needles!
    Thou flaming Spirit of the Earth! which, sitting
    High on the Monarch's Diadem, attractest
    More worship than the majesty who sweats
    Beneath the crown which makes his head ache, like
    Millions of hearts which bleed to lend it lustre!
    Shalt thou be mine? I am, methinks, already
    A little king, a lucky alchymist!--                                340
    A wise magician, who has bound the devil
    Without the forfeit of his soul. But come,
    Werner, or what else?

    _Wer._                Call me Werner still;
    You may yet know me by a loftier title.

    _Iden._ I do believe in thee! thou art the spirit
    Of whom I long have dreamed in a low garb.--
    But come, I'll serve thee; thou shalt be as free
    As air, despite the waters; let us hence:
    I'll show thee I am honest--(oh, thou jewel!)
    Thou shalt be furnished, Werner, with such means                   350
    Of flight, that if thou wert a snail, not birds[cu]
    Should overtake thee.--Let me gaze again!
    I have a foster-brother in the mart
    Of Hamburgh skilled in precious stones. How many
    Carats may it weigh?--Come, Werner, I will wing thee.
                                                                [_Exeunt_.


                   SCENE II.--STRALENHEIM'S _Chamber_.

                         STRALENHEIM _and_ FRITZ.

    _Fritz_. All's ready, my good Lord!

    _Stral._                            I am not sleepy,
    And yet I must to bed: I fain would say
    To rest, but something heavy on my spirit,
    Too dull for wakefulness, too quick for slumber,
    Sits on me as a cloud along the sky,
    Which will not let the sunbeams through, nor yet
    Descend in rain and end, but spreads itself
    'Twixt earth and heaven, like envy between man
    And man, an everlasting mist:--I will
    Unto my pillow.

    _Fritz_.        May you rest there well!                            10

    _Stral._ I feel, and fear, I shall.

    _Fritz_.                            And wherefore fear?

    _Stral._ I know not why, and therefore do fear more,
    Because an undescribable----but 'tis
    All folly. Were the locks as I desired
    Changed, to-day, of this chamber? for last night's
    Adventure makes it needful.

    _Fritz_.                    Certainly,
    According to your order, and beneath
    The inspection of myself and the young Saxon
    Who saved your life. I think they call him "Ulric."

    _Stral._ You _think!_ you supercilious slave! what right            20
    Have you to _tax your_ memory, which should be
    Quick, proud, and happy to retain the _name_
    Of him who saved your master, as a litany
    Whose daily repetition marks your duty.--
    Get hence; "_You think_" indeed! you, who stood still
    Howling and dripping on the bank, whilst I
    Lay dying, and the stranger dashed aside
    The roaring torrent, and restored me to
    Thank him--and despise you. "_You think!_" and scarce
    Can recollect his name! I will not waste                            30
    More words on you. Call me betimes.

    _Fritz_.                            Good night!
    I trust to-morrow will restore your Lordship
    To renovated strength and temper.                 [_The scene closes_.


                    SCENE III.--_The secret Passage_.

    _Gab._ (_solus_).                  Four--
    Five--six hours have I counted, like the guard
    Of outposts, on the never-merry clock,
    That hollow tongue[190] of time, which, even when
    It sounds for joy, takes something from enjoyment
    With every clang. 'Tis a perpetual knell,
    Though for a marriage-feast it rings: each stroke
    Peals for a hope the less; the funeral note
    Of Love deep-buried, without resurrection,
    In the grave of Possession; while the knoll[191]                    10
    Of long-lived parents finds a jovial echo
    To triple time in the son's ear.
                                     I'm cold--
    I'm dark;--I've blown my fingers--numbered o'er
    And o'er my steps--and knocked my head against
    Some fifty buttresses--and roused the rats
    And bats in general insurrection, till
    Their cursed pattering feet and whirling wings
    Leave me scarce hearing for another sound.
    A light! It is at distance (if I can
    Measure in darkness distance): but it blinks                        20
    As through a crevice or a key-hole, in
    The inhibited direction: I must on,
    Nevertheless, from curiosity.
    A distant lamp-light is an incident
    In such a den as this. Pray Heaven it lead me
    To nothing that may tempt me! Else--Heaven aid me
    To obtain or to escape it! Shining still!
    Were it the star of Lucifer himself,
    Or he himself girt with its beams, I could
    Contain no longer. Softly: mighty well!                             30
    That corner's turned--so--ah! no;--right! it draws
    Nearer. Here is a darksome angle--so,
    That's weathered.--Let me pause.--Suppose it leads
    Into some greater danger than that which
    I have escaped--no matter, 'tis a new one;
    And novel perils, like fresh mistresses,
    Wear more magnetic aspects:--I will on,
    And be it where it may--I have my dagger
    Which may protect me at a pinch.--Burn still,
    Thou little light! Thou art my _ignis fatuus!_                      40
    My stationary Will-o'-the-wisp![192]--So! so!
    He hears my invocation, and fails not.            [_The scene closes_.


                          SCENE IV.--_A Garden_.

                             _Enter_ WERNER.

    _Wer._ I could not sleep--and now the hour's at hand!
    All's ready. Idenstein has kept his word;
    And stationed in the outskirts of the town,
    Upon the forest's edge, the vehicle
    Awaits us. Now the dwindling stars begin
    To pale in heaven; and for the last time I
    Look on these horrible walls. Oh! never, never
    Shall I forget them. Here I came most poor,
    But not dishonoured: and I leave them with
    A stain,--if not upon my name, yet in                               10
    My heart!--a never-dying canker-worm,
    Which all the coming splendour of the lands,
    And rights, and sovereignty of Siegendorf
    Can scarcely lull a moment. I must find
    Some means of restitution, which would ease
    My soul in part: but how, without discovery?--
    It must be done, however; and I'll pause
    Upon the method the first hour of safety.
    The madness of my misery led to this
    Base infamy; repentance must retrieve it:                           20
    I will have nought of Stralenheim's upon
    My spirit, though he would grasp all of mine;
    Lands, freedom, life,--and yet he sleeps as soundly
    Perhaps, as infancy[193], with gorgeous curtains
    Spread for his canopy, o'er silken pillows,
    Such as when----Hark! what noise is that? Again!
    The branches shake; and some loose stones have fallen
    From yonder terrace.
                                     [ULRIC _leaps down from the terrace_.
                        Ulric! ever welcome!
    Thrice welcome now! this filial----

    _Ulr._                              Stop! before
    We approach, tell me----

    _Wer._                   Why look you so?

    _Ulr._                                   Do I                       30
    Behold my father, or----

    _Wer._                   What?

    _Ulr._                        An assassin?

    _Wer._ Insane or insolent!

    _Ulr._                     Reply, sir, as
    You prize your life, or mine!

    _Wer._                       To what must I
    Answer?

    _Ulr._ Are you or are you not the assassin
    Of Stralenheim?

    _Wer._          I never was as yet
    The murderer of any man. What mean you?

    _Ulr._ Did not you _this_ night (as the night before)
    Retrace the secret passage? Did you not
    _Again_ revisit Stralenheim's chamber? and----
                                                          [ULRIC _pauses_.

    _Wer._ Proceed.

    _Ulr._         _Died_ he not by your hand?

    _Wer._                                    Great God!                40

    _Ulr._ You are innocent, then! my father's innocent!
    Embrace me! Yes,--your tone--your look--yes, yes,--
    Yet _say_ so.

    _Wer._        If I e'er, in heart or mind,
    Conceived deliberately such a thought,
    But rather strove to trample back to hell
    Such thoughts--if e'er they glared a moment through
    The irritation of my oppressed spirit--
    May Heaven be shut for ever from my hopes,
    As from mine eyes!

    _Ulr._            But Stralenheim is dead.

    _Wer._ 'Tis horrible! 'tis hideous, as 'tis hateful!--              50
    But what have I to do with this?

    _Ulr._                           No bolt
    Is forced; no violence can be detected,
    Save on his body. Part of his own household
    Have been alarmed; but as the Intendant is
    Absent, I took upon myself the care
    Of mustering the police. His chamber has,
    Past doubt, been entered secretly. Excuse me,
    If nature----

    _Wer._       Oh, my boy! what unknown woes
    Of dark fatality, like clouds, are gathering
    Above our house!

    _Ulr._          My father! I acquit you!                            60
    But will the world do so? will even the judge,
    If--but you must away this instant.

    _Wer._                              No!
    I'll face it. Who shall dare suspect me?

    _Ulr._                                   Yet
    You had _no_ guests--_no_ visitors--no life
    Breathing around you, save my mother's?

    _Wer._                                  Ah!
    The Hungarian?

    _Ulr._        He is gone! he disappeared
    Ere sunset.

    _Wer._       No; I hid him in that very
    Concealed and fatal gallery.

    _Ulr._                      _There_ I'll find him.
                                                        [ULRIC _is going_.

    _Wer._ It is too late: he had left the palace ere
    I quitted it. I found the secret panel                              70
    Open, and the doors which lead from that hall
    Which masks it: I but thought he had snatched the silent
    And favourable moment to escape
    The myrmidons of Idenstein, who were
    Dogging him yester-even.

    _Ulr._                  You reclosed
    The panel?

    _Wer._     Yes; and not without reproach
    (And inner trembling for the avoided peril)
    At his dull heedlessness, in leaving thus
    His shelterer's asylum to the risk
    Of a discovery.

    _Ulr._         You are sure you closed it?                          80

    _Wer._ Certain.

    _Ulr._         That's well; but had been better, if
    You ne'er had turned it to a den for----                 [_He pauses_.

    _Wer._                                   Thieves!
    Thou wouldst say: I must bear it, and deserve it;
    But not----

    _Ulr._      No, father; do not speak of this:
    This is no hour to think of petty crimes,
    But to prevent the consequence of great ones.
    Why would you shelter this man?

    _Wer._                          Could I shun it?
    A man pursued by my chief foe; disgraced
    For my own crime: a victim to _my_ safety,
    Imploring a few hours' concealment from                             90
    The very wretch who was the cause he needed
    Such refuge. Had he been a wolf, I could not
    Have in such circumstances thrust him forth.

    _Ulr._ And like the wolf he hath repaid you. But
    It is too late to ponder thus:--you must
    Set out ere dawn. I will remain here to
    Trace the murderer, if 'tis possible.

    _Wer._ But this my sudden flight will give the Moloch
    Suspicion: two new victims in the lieu
    Of one, if I remain. The fled Hungarian,                           100
    Who seems the culprit, and----

    _Ulr._                        Who _seems?_ _Who_ else
    Can be so?

    _Wer._     Not _I_, though just now you doubted--
    You, my _son!_--doubted----

    _Ulr._                      And do you doubt of him
    The fugitive?

    _Wer._        Boy! since I fell into
    The abyss of crime (though not of _such_ crime), I,
    Having seen the innocent oppressed for me,
    May doubt even of the guilty's guilt. Your heart
    Is free, and quick with virtuous wrath to accuse
    Appearances; and views a criminal
    In Innocence's shadow, it may be,                                  110
    Because 'tis dusky.

    _Ulr._               And if I do so,
    What will mankind, who know you not, or knew
    But to oppress? You must not stand the hazard.
    Away!--I'll make all easy. Idenstein
    Will for his own sake and his jewel's hold
    His peace--he also is a partner in
    Your flight--moreover----

    _Wer._                    Fly! and leave my name
    Linked with the Hungarian's, or, preferred as poorest,
    To bear the brand of bloodshed?

    _Ulr._                         Pshaw! leave any thing
    Except our fathers' sovereignty and castles,                       120
    For which you have so long panted, and in vain!
    What _name?_ You have _no name_, since that you bear
    Is feigned.

    _Wer._      Most true: but still I would not have it
    Engraved in crimson in men's memories,
    Though in this most obscure abode of men----
    Besides, the search----

    _Ulr._                I will provide against
    Aught that can touch you. No one knows you here
    As heir of Siegendorf: if Idenstein
    Suspects, 'tis _but suspicion_, and he is
    A fool: his folly shall have such employment,                      130
    Too, that the unknown Werner shall give way
    To nearer thoughts of self. The laws (if e'er
    Laws reached this village) are all in abeyance
    With the late general war of thirty years,
    Or crushed, or rising slowly from the dust,
    To which the march of armies trampled them.
    Stralenheim, although noble, is unheeded
    _Here_, save as _such_--without lands, influence,
    Save what hath perished with him. Few prolong
    A week beyond their funeral rites their sway                       140
    O'er men, unless by relatives, whose interest
    Is roused: such is not here the case; he died
    Alone, unknown,--a solitary grave,
    Obscure as his deserts, without a scutcheon,
    Is all he'll have, or wants. If _I_ discover
    The assassin, 'twill be well--if not, believe me,
    None else; though all the full-fed train of menials
    May howl above his ashes (as they did
    Around him in his danger on the Oder),
    Will no more stir a finger _now_ than _then_.                      150
    Hence! hence! I must not hear your answer.--Look!
    The stars are almost faded, and the grey
    Begins to grizzle the black hair of night.
    You shall not answer:--Pardon me that I
    Am peremptory: 'tis your son that speaks,
    Your long-lost, late-found son.--Let's call my mother!
    Softly and swiftly step, and leave the rest
    To me: I'll answer for the event as far
    As regards _you_, and that is the chief point,
    As my first duty, which shall be observed.                         160
    We'll meet in Castle Siegendorf--once more
    Our banners shall be glorious! Think of that
    Alone, and leave all other thoughts to me,
    Whose youth may better battle with them--Hence!
    And may your age be happy!--I will kiss
    My mother once more, then Heaven's speed be with you!

    _Wer._ This counsel's safe--but is it honourable?

    _Ulr._ To save a father is a child's chief honour.
                                                                [_Exeunt_.




                                 ACT IV.


   SCENE I.--_A Gothic Hall in the Castle of Siegendorf, near Prague_.

          _Enter_ ERIC _and_ HENRICK, _Retainers of the Count_.

    _Eric_. So, better times are come at last; to these
    Old walls new masters and high wassail--both
    A long desideratum.

    _Hen._              Yes, for _masters_,
    It might be unto those who long for novelty,
    Though made by a new grave: but, as for wassail,
    Methinks the old Count Siegendorf maintained
    His feudal hospitality as high
    As e'er another Prince of the empire.

    _Eric_.                               Why
    For the mere cup and trencher, we no doubt
    Fared passing well; but as for merriment                            10
    And sport, without which salt and sauces season
    The cheer but scantily, our sizings were
    Even of the narrowest.

    _Hen._                 The old count loved not
    The roar of revel; are you sure that _this_ does?

    _Eric_. As yet he hath been courteous as he's bounteous,
    And we all love him.

    _Hen._               His reign is as yet
    Hardly a year o'erpast its honeymoon,
    And the first year of sovereigns is bridal:
    Anon, we shall perceive his real sway
    And moods of mind.

    _Eric_.            Pray Heaven he keep the present!                 20
    Then his brave son, Count Ulric--there's a knight!
    Pity the wars are o'er!

    _Hen._                  Why so?

    _Eric_.                        Look on him!
    And answer that yourself.

    _Hen._                    He's very youthful,
    And strong and beautiful as a young tiger.

    _Eric_. That's not a faithful vassal's likeness.

    _Hen._                                           But
    Perhaps a true one.

    _Eric_.              Pity, as I said,
    The wars are over: in the hall, who like
    Count Ulric for a well-supported pride,
    Which awes, but yet offends not? in the field,
    Who like him with his spear in hand, when gnashing                  30
    His tusks, and ripping up, from right to left,
    The howling hounds, the boar makes for the thicket?
    Who backs a horse, or bears a hawk, or wears
    A sword like him? Whose plume nods knightlier?

    _Hen._ No one's, I grant you. Do not fear, if war
    Be long in coming, he is of that kind
    Will make it for himself, if he hath not
    Already done as much.

    _Eric_.               What do you mean?

    _Hen._ You can't deny his train of followers
    (But few our native fellow-vassals born                             40
    On the domain) are such a sort of knaves
    As----                                                      [_Pauses_.

    _Eric_. What?

    _Hen._       The war (you love so much) leaves living.
    Like other parents, she spoils her worst children.

    _Eric_. Nonsense! they are all brave iron-visaged fellows,
    Such as old Tilly loved.

    _Hen._                   And who loved Tilly?
    Ask that at Magdebourg[194]--or, for that matter,
    Wallenstein either;--they are gone to----

    _Eric_.                                   Rest!
    But what beyond 'tis not ours to pronounce.

    _Hen._ I wish they had left us something of their rest:
    The country (nominally now at peace)                                50
    Is over-run with--God knows who: they fly
    By night, and disappear with sunrise; but
    Leave us no less desolation, nay, even more,
    Than the most open warfare.

    _Eric_.                    But Count Ulric--
    What has all this to do with him?

    _Hen._                            With him!
    He----might prevent it. As you say he's fond
    Of war, why makes he it not on those marauders?

    _Eric_. You'd better ask himself.

    _Hen._                            I would as soon
    Ask the lion why he laps not milk.

    _Eric_. And here he comes!

    _Hen._                    The devil! you'll hold your tongue?       60

    _Eric_. Why do you turn so pale?

    _Hen._                          'Tis nothing--but
    Be silent.

    _Eric_.    I will, upon what you have said.

    _Hen._ I assure you I meant nothing,--a mere sport
    Of words, no more; besides, had it been otherwise,
    He is to espouse the gentle Baroness
    Ida of Stralenheim, the late Baron's heiress;
    And she, no doubt, will soften whatsoever
    Of fierceness the late long intestine wars
    Have given all natures, and most unto those
    Who were born in them, and bred up upon                             70
    The knees of Homicide; sprinkled, as it were,
    With blood even at their baptism. Prithee, peace
    On all that I have said!

                       _Enter_ ULRIC _and_ RODOLPH.

                            Good morrow, count.

    _Ulr._ Good morrow, worthy Henrick. Eric, is
    All ready for the chase?

    _Eric_.                 The dogs are ordered
    Down to the forest, and the vassals out
    To beat the bushes, and the day looks promising.
    Shall I call forth your Excellency's suite?
    What courser will you please to mount?

    _Ulr._                                 The dun,
    Walstein.

    _Eric_.   I fear he scarcely has recovered                          80
    The toils of Monday: 'twas a noble chase:
    You speared _four_ with your own hand.

    _Ulr._                                 True, good Eric;
    I had forgotten--let it be the grey, then,
    Old Ziska: he has not been out this fortnight.

    _Eric_. He shall be straight caparisoned. How many
    Of your immediate retainers shall
    Escort you?

    _Ulr._      I leave that to Weilburgh, our
    Master of the horse.                                     [_Exit_ ERIC.
                        Rodolph!

    _Rod._                      My Lord!

    _Ulr._                              The news
    Is awkward from the----                  [RODOLPH _points to_ HENRICK.
                           How now, Henrick? why
    Loiter you here?

    _Hen._          For your commands, my Lord.                         90

    _Ulr._ Go to my father, and present my duty,
    And learn if he would aught with me before
    I mount.                                              [_Exit_ HENRICK.
             Rodolph, our friends have had a check
    Upon the frontiers of Franconia[195], and
    'Tis rumoured that the column sent against them
    Is to be strengthened. I must join them soon.

    _Rod._ Best wait for further and more sure advices.

    _Ulr._ I mean it--and indeed it could not well
    Have fallen out at a time more opposite
    To all my plans.

    _Rod._            It will be difficult                             100
    To excuse your absence to the Count your father.

    _Ulr._ Yes, but the unsettled state of our domain
    In high Silesia will permit and cover
    My journey. In the mean time, when we are
    Engaged in the chase, draw off the eighty men
    Whom Wolffe leads--keep the forests on your route:
    You know it well?

    _Rod._           As well as on that night
    When we----

    _Ulr._     We will not speak of that until
    We can repeat the same with like success:
    And when you have joined, give Rosenberg this letter.              110
                                                        [_Gives a letter_.
    Add further, that I have sent this slight addition
    To our force with you and Wolffe, as herald of
    My coming, though I could but spare them ill
    At this time, as my father loves to keep
    Full numbers of retainers round the castle,
    Until this marriage, and its feasts and fooleries,
    Are rung out with its peal of nuptial nonsense.

    _Rod._ I thought you loved the lady Ida?

    _Ulr._                                   Why,
    I do so--but it follows not from that
    I would bind in my youth and glorious years,                       120
    So brief and burning, with a lady's zone,
    Although 'twere that of Venus:--but I love her,
    As woman should be loved--fairly and solely.

    _Rod._ And constantly?

    _Ulr._                 I think so; for I love
    Nought else.--But I have not the time to pause
    Upon these gewgaws of the heart. Great things
    We have to do ere long. Speed! speed! good Rodolph!

    _Rod._ On my return, however, I shall find
    The Baroness Ida lost in Countess Siegendorf?

    _Ulr._ Perhaps: my father wishes it, and, sooth,                   130
    'Tis no bad policy: this union with
    The last bud of the rival branch at once
    Unites the future and destroys the past.

    _Rod._ Adieu.

    _Ulr._        Yet hold--we had better keep together
    Until the chase begins; then draw thou off,
    And do as I have said.

    _Rod._                 I will. But to
    Return--'twas a most kind act in the count
    Your father to send up to Konigsberg
    For this fair orphan of the Baron, and
    To hail her as his daughter.

    _Ulr._                       Wondrous kind!                        140
    Especially as little kindness till
    Then grew between them.

    _Rod._                  The late Baron died
    Of a fever, did he not?

    _Ulr._                 How should I know?

    _Rod._ I have heard it whispered there was something strange
    About his death--and even the place of it
    Is scarcely known.

    _Ulr._             Some obscure village on
    The Saxon or Silesian frontier.

    _Rod._                           He
    Has left no testament--no farewell words?

    _Ulr._ I am neither confessor nor notary,
    So cannot say.

    _Rod._         Ah! here's the lady Ida.                            150

                         _Enter_ IDA STRALENHEIM.

    _Ulr._ You are early, my sweet cousin!

    _Ida._                                 Not _too_ early,
    Dear Ulric, if I do not interrupt you.
    Why do you call me "_Cousin?_"

    _Ulr._ (_smiling_).            Are we not so?

    _Ida._ Yes, but I do not like the name; methinks
    It sounds so cold, as if you thought upon
    Our pedigree, and only weighed our blood.

    _Ulr._ (_starting_).                       Blood!

    _Ida._ Why does yours start from your cheeks?

    _Ulr._                                        Aye! doth it?

    _Ida._ It doth--but no! it rushes like a torrent
    Even to your brow again.

    _Ulr._ (_recovering himself_). And if it fled,
    It only was because your presence sent it                          160
    Back to my heart, which beats for you, sweet Cousin!

    _Ida._   "Cousin" again.

    _Ulr._                  Nay, then, I'll call you sister.

    _Ida._ I like that name still worse.--Would we had ne'er
    Been aught of kindred!

    _Ulr._ (_gloomily_). Would we never had!

    _Ida._ Oh, heavens! and can _you wish that?_

    _Ulr._                                       Dearest Ida!
    Did I not echo your own wish?

    _Ida._                        Yes, Ulric,
    But then I wished it not with such a glance,
    And scarce knew what I said; but let me be
    Sister, or cousin, what you will, so that
    I still to you am something.

    _Ulr._                      You shall be                           170
    All--all----

    _Ida._        And you to _me are_ so already;
    But I can wait.

    _Ulr._          Dear Ida!

    _Ida._                  Call me Ida,
    _Your_ Ida, for I would be yours, none else's--
    Indeed I have none else left, since my poor father--
                                                            [_She pauses_.

    _Ulr._ You have _mine_--you have _me_.

    _Ida._                                 Dear Ulric, how I wish
    My father could but view my happiness,
    Which wants but this!

    _Ulr._               Indeed!

    _Ida._                       You would have loved him,
    He you; for the brave ever love each other:
    His manner was a little cold, his spirit
    Proud (as is birth's prerogative); but under                       180
    This grave exterior----Would you had known each other!
    Had such as you been near him on his journey,
    He had not died without a friend to soothe
    His last and lonely moments.

    _Ulr._                       Who says _that?_

    _Ida._ What?

    _Ulr._       That he _died alone_.

    _Ida._                            The general rumour,
    And disappearance of his servants, who
    Have ne'er returned: that fever was most deadly
    Which swept them all away.

    _Ulr._                     If they were near him,
    He could not die neglected or alone.

    _Ida._ Alas! what is a menial to a death-bed,                      190
    When the dim eye rolls vainly round for what
    It loves?--They say he died of a fever.

    _Ulr._                                _Say!_
    It _was_ so.

    _Ida._       I sometimes dream otherwise.

    _Ulr._ All dreams are false.

    _Ida._                       And yet I see him as
    I see you.

    _Ulr._    _Where?_

    _Ida._            In sleep--I see him lie
    Pale, bleeding, and a man with a raised knife
    Beside him.

    _Ulr._       But you do not see his _face?_

    _Ida_ (_looking at him_). No! Oh, my God! do _you?_

    _Ulr._                                              Why do you ask?

    _Ida._ Because you look as if you saw a murderer!

    _Ulr._ (_agitatedly_).
    Ida, this is mere childishness; your weakness                      200
    Infects me, to my shame: but as all feelings
    Of yours are common to me, it affects me.
    Prithee, sweet child, change----

    _Ida._                           Child, indeed! I have
    Full fifteen summers!                               [_A bugle sounds_.

    _Rod._                Hark, my Lord, the bugle!

    _Ida_ (_peevishly to_ RODOLPH).
    Why need you tell him that? Can he not hear it
    Without your echo?

    _Rod._            Pardon me, fair Baroness!

    _Ida._ I will not pardon you, unless you earn it
    By aiding me in my dissuasion of
    Count Ulric from the chase to-day.

    _Rod._                             You will not,
    Lady, need aid of mine.

    _Ulr._                  I must not now                             210
    Forgo it.

    _Ida._    But you shall!

    _Ulr._                  _Shall!_

    _Ida._                          Yes, or be
    No true knight.--Come, dear Ulric! yield to me
    In this, for this one day: the day looks heavy,
    And you are turned so pale and ill.

    _Ulr._                              You jest.

    _Ida._ Indeed I do not:--ask of Rodolph.

    _Rod._                                   Truly,
    My Lord, within this quarter of an hour
    You have changed more than e'er I saw you change
    In years.

    _Ulr._    'Tis nothing; but if 'twere, the air
    Would soon restore me. I'm the true cameleon,
    And live but on the atmosphere;[196] your feasts                   220
    In castle halls, and social banquets, nurse not
    My spirit--I'm a forester and breather
    Of the steep mountain-tops,[197] where I love all
    The eagle loves.

    _Ida._          Except his prey, I hope.

    _Ulr._ Sweet Ida, wish me a fair chase, and I
    Will bring you six boars' heads for trophies home.

    _Ida._ And will you not stay, then? You shall not go!
    Come! I will sing to you.

    _Ulr._                    Ida, you scarcely
    Will make a soldier's wife.

    _Ida._                      I do not wish
    To be so; for I trust these wars are over,                         230
    And you will live in peace on your domains.

                  _Enter_ WERNER _as_ COUNT SIEGENDORF.

    _Ulr._ My father, I salute you, and it grieves me
    With such brief greeting.--You have heard our bugle;
    The vassals wait.

    _Sieg._           So let them.--You forget
    To-morrow is the appointed festival
    In Prague[198] for peace restored. You are apt to follow
    The chase with such an ardour as will scarce
    Permit you to return to-day, or if
    Returned, too much fatigued to join to-morrow
    The nobles in our marshalled ranks.

    _Ulr._                             You, Count,                     240
    Will well supply the place of both--I am not
    A lover of these pageantries.

    _Sieg._                       No, Ulric;
    It were not well that you alone of all
    Our young nobility----

    _Ida._                 And far the noblest
    In aspect and demeanour.

    _Sieg._ (_to_ IDA).     True, dear child,
    Though somewhat frankly said for a fair damsel.--
    But, Ulric, recollect too our position,
    So lately reinstated in our honours.
    Believe me, 'twould be marked in any house,
    But most in _ours_, that ONE should be found wanting               250
    At such a time and place. Besides, the Heaven
    Which gave us back our own, in the same moment
    It spread its peace o'er all, hath double claims
    On us for thanksgiving: first, for our country;
    And next, that we are here to share its blessings.

    _Ulr._ (_aside_). Devout, too! Well, sir, I obey at once.
    (_Then aloud to a servant_.)
    Ludwig, dismiss the train without!
                                                           [_Exit_ LUDWIG.
    _Ida._                            And so
    You yield, at once, to him what I for hours
    Might supplicate in vain.

    _Sieg._ (_smiling_).      You are not jealous
    Of me, I trust, my pretty rebel! who                               260
    Would sanction disobedience against all
    Except thyself? But fear not; thou shalt rule him
    Hereafter with a fonder sway and firmer.

    _Ida._ But I should like to govern _now_.

    _Sieg._                                   You shall,
    Your _harp_, which by the way awaits you with
    The Countess in her chamber. She complains
    That you are a sad truant to your music:
    She attends you.

    _Ida._           Then good morrow, my kind kinsmen!
    Ulric, you'll come and hear me?

    _Ulr._                          By and by.

    _Ida._ Be sure I'll sound it better than your bugles;              270
    Then pray you be as punctual to its notes:
    I'll play you King Gustavus' march.

    _Ulr._                              And why not
    Old Tilly's?

    _Ida._       Not that monster's! I should think
    My harp-strings rang with groans, and not with music,
    Could aught of _his_ sound on it:--but come quickly;
    Your mother will be eager to receive you.                 [_Exit_ IDA.

    _Sieg._ Ulric, I wish to speak with you alone.

    _Ulr._ My time's your vassal.--
    (_Aside to_ RODOLPH.) Rodolph, hence! and do
    As I directed: and by his best speed
    And readiest means let Rosenberg reply.                            280

    _Rod._ Count Siegendorf, command you aught? I am bound
    Upon a journey past the frontier.

    _Sieg._ (_starts_).                Ah!--
    Where? on _what_ frontier?

    _Rod._                    The Silesian, on
    My way--(_Aside to_ ULRIC.)--_Where_ shall I say?

    _Ulr._ (_aside to_ RODOLPH).         To Hamburgh.
                             (_Aside to himself_). That
    Word will, I think, put a firm padlock on
    His further inquisition.

    _Rod._                   Count, to Hamburgh.

    _Sieg._ (_agitated_). Hamburgh! No, I have nought to do there, nor
    Am aught connected with that city. Then
    God speed you!

    _Rod._         Fare ye well, Count Siegendorf!
                                                          [_Exit_ RODOLPH.

    _Sieg._ Ulric, this man, who has just departed, is                 290
    One of those strange companions whom I fain
    Would reason with you on.

    _Ulr._                    My Lord, he is
    Noble by birth, of one of the first houses
    In Saxony.

    _Sieg._    I talk not of his birth,
    But of his bearing. Men speak lightly of him.

    _Ulr._ So they will do of most men. Even the monarch
    Is not fenced from his chamberlain's slander, or
    The sneer of the last courtier whom he has made
    Great and ungrateful.

    _Sieg._               If I must be plain,
    The world speaks more than lightly of this Rodolph:                300
    They say he is leagued with the "black bands" who still
    Ravage the frontier.

    _Ulr._               And will you believe
    The world?

    _Sieg._    In this case--yes.

    _Ulr._                       In _any_ case,
    I thought you knew it better than to take
    An accusation for a sentence.

    _Sieg._                       Son!
    I understand you: you refer to----but
    My destiny has so involved about me
    Her spider web, that I can only flutter
    Like the poor fly, but break it not. Take heed,
    Ulric; you have seen to what the passions led me:                  310
    Twenty long years of misery and famine
    Quenched them not--twenty thousand more, perchance,
    Hereafter (or even here in _moments_ which
    Might date for years, did Anguish make the dial),
    May not obliterate or expiate
    The madness and dishonour of an instant.
    Ulric, be warned by a father!--I was not
    By mine, and you behold me!

    _Ulr._                     I behold
    The prosperous and beloved Siegendorf,
    Lord of a Prince's appanage, and honoured                          320
    By those he rules and those he ranks with.

    _Sieg._                                    Ah!
    Why wilt thou call me prosperous, while I fear
    For thee? Beloved, when thou lovest me not!
    All hearts but one may beat in kindness for me--
    But if my son's is cold!----

    _Ulr._                       Who _dare_ say that?

    _Sieg._ None else but I, who see it--_feel_ it--keener
    Than would your adversary, who dared say so,
    Your sabre in his heart! But mine survives
    The wound.

    _Ulr._     You err. My nature is not given
    To outward fondling: how should it be so,                          330
    After twelve years' divorcement from my parents?

    _Sieg._ And did not _I_ too pass those twelve torn years
    In a like absence? But 'tis vain to urge you--
    Nature was never called back by remonstrance.
    Let's change the theme. I wish you to consider
    That these young violent nobles of high name,
    But dark deeds (aye, the darkest, if all Rumour
    Reports be true), with whom thou consortest,
    Will lead thee----

    _Ulr._ (_impatiently_). I'll be _led_ by no man.

    _Sieg._                                         Nor
    Be leader of such, I would hope: at once                           340
    To wean thee from the perils of thy youth
    And haughty spirit, I have thought it well
    That thou shouldst wed the lady Ida--more
    As thou appear'st to love her.

    _Ulr._                        I have said
    I will obey your orders, were they to
    Unite with Hecate--can a son say more?

    _Sieg._ He says too much in saying this. It is not
    The nature of thine age, nor of thy blood,
    Nor of thy temperament, to talk so coolly,
    Or act so carelessly, in that which is                             350
    The bloom or blight of all men's happiness,
    (For Glory's pillow is but restless, if
    Love lay not down his cheek there): some strong bias,
    Some master fiend is in thy service, to
    Misrule the mortal who believes him slave,
    And makes his every thought subservient; else
    Thou'dst say at once--"I love young Ida, and
    Will wed her;" or, "I love her not, and all
    The powers on earth shall never make me."--So
    Would _I_ have answered.

    _Ulr._                  Sir, _you_ wed for love.                   360

    _Sieg._ I did, and it has been my only refuge
    In many miseries.

    _Ulr._            Which miseries
    Had never been but for this love-match.

    _Sieg._                                 Still
    Against your age and nature! Who at twenty
    E'er answered thus till now?

    _Ulr._                       Did you not warn me
    Against your own example?

    _Sieg._                  Boyish sophist!
    In a word, do you love, or love not, Ida?

    _Ulr._ What matters it, if I am ready to
    Obey you in espousing her?

    _Sieg._                    As far
    As you feel, nothing--but all life for her.                        370
    She's young--all-beautiful--adores you--is
    Endowed with qualities to give happiness,
    Such as rounds common life into a dream
    Of something which your poets cannot paint,
    And (if it were not wisdom to love virtue),
    For which Philosophy might barter Wisdom;
    And giving so much happiness, deserves
    A little in return. I would not have her
    Break her heart with a man who has none to break!
    Or wither on her stalk like some pale rose                         380
    Deserted by the bird she thought a nightingale,
    According to the Orient tale.[199] She is----

    _Ulr._ The daughter of dead Stralenheim, your foe:
    I'll wed her, ne'ertheless; though, to say truth,
    Just now I am not violently transported
    In favour of such unions.

    _Sieg._                   But she loves you.

    _Ulr._ And I love her, and therefore would think _twice_.

    _Sieg._ Alas! Love never did so.

    _Ulr._                           Then 'tis time
    He should begin, and take the bandage from
    His eyes, and look before he leaps; till now                       390
    He hath ta'en a jump i' the dark.

    _Sieg._                           But you consent?

    _Ulr._ I did, and do.

    _Sieg._               Then fix the day.

    _Ulr._                                 Tis usual,
    And, certes, courteous, to leave that to the lady.

    _Sieg._ _I_ will engage for _her_.

    _Ulr._                            So will not _I_
    For any woman: and as what I fix,
    I fain would see unshaken, when she gives
    Her answer, I'll give mine.

    _Sieg._                     But 'tis your office
    To woo.

    _Ulr._ Count, 'tis a marriage of your making,
    So be it of your wooing; but to please you,
    I will now pay my duty to my mother,                               400
    With whom, you know, the lady Ida is.--
    What would you have? You have forbid my stirring
    For manly sports beyond the castle walls,
    And I obey; you bid me turn a chamberer,
    To pick up gloves, and fans, and knitting-needles,
    And list to songs and tunes, and watch for smiles,
    And smile at pretty prattle, and look into
    The eyes of feminine, as though they were
    The stars receding early to our wish
    Upon the dawn of a world-winning battle--                          410
    What can a son or man do more?                          [_Exit_ ULRIC.

    _Sieg._ (_solus_).             Too much!--
    Too much of duty, and too little love!
    He pays me in the coin he owes me not:
    For such hath been my wayward fate, I could not
    Fulfil a parent's duties by his side
    Till now; but love he owes me, for my thoughts
    Ne'er left him, nor my eyes longed without tears
    To see my child again,--and now I have found him!
    But how! obedient, but with coldness; duteous
    In my sight, but with carelessness; mysterious--                   420
    Abstracted--distant--much given to long absence,
    And where--none know--in league with the most riotous
    Of our young nobles; though, to do him justice,
    He never stoops down to their vulgar pleasures;
    Yet there's some tie between them which I can not
    Unravel. They look up to him--consult him--
    Throng round him as a leader: but with me
    He hath no confidence! Ah! can I hope it
    After--what! doth my father's curse descend
    Even to my child? Or is the Hungarian near                         430
    To shed more blood? or--Oh! if it should be!
    Spirit of Stralenheim, dost thou walk these walls
    To wither him and his--who, though they slew not,
    Unlatched the door of Death for thee? 'Twas not
    Our fault, nor is our sin: thou wert our foe,
    And yet I spared thee when my own destruction
    Slept with thee, to awake with thine awakening!
    And only took--Accursed gold! thou liest
    Like poison in my hands; I dare not use thee,
    Nor part from thee; thou camest in such a guise,                   440
    Methinks thou wouldst contaminate all hands
    Like mine. Yet I have done, to atone for thee,
    Thou villanous gold! and thy dead master's doom,
    Though he died not by me or mine, as much
    As if he were my brother! I have ta'en
    His orphan Ida--cherished her as one
    Who will be mine.

                          _Enter an_ ATTENDANT.

    _Atten._          The abbot, if it please
    Your Excellency, whom you sent for, waits
    Upon you.                                           [_Exit_ ATTENDANT.

                        _Enter the_ PRIOR ALBERT.

    _Prior_. Peace be with these walls, and all
    Within them!

    _Sieg._      Welcome, welcome, holy father!                        450
    And may thy prayer be heard!--all men have need
    Of such, and I----

    _Prior_.            Have the first claim to all
    The prayers of our community. Our convent,
    Erected by your ancestors, is still
    Protected by their children.

    _Sieg._                      Yes, good father;
    Continue daily orisons for us
    In these dim days of heresies and blood,
    Though the schismatic Swede, Gustavus, is
    Gone home.

    _Prior_.    To the endless home of unbelievers,
    Where there is everlasting wail and woe,                           460
    Gnashing of teeth, and tears of blood, and fire
    Eternal and the worm which dieth not!

    _Sieg._ True, father: and to avert those pangs from one,
    Who, though of our most faultless holy Church,
    Yet died without its last and dearest offices,
    Which smooth the soul through purgatorial pains,
    I have to offer humbly this donation
    In masses for his spirit.
        [SIEGENDORF _offers the gold which he had taken from_ STRALENHEIM.

    _Prior_.                 Count, if I
    Receive it, 'tis because I know too well
    Refusal would offend you. Be assured                               470
    The largess shall be only dealt in alms,
    And every mass no less sung for the dead.
    Our House needs no donations, thanks to yours,
    Which has of old endowed it; but from you
    And yours in all meet things 'tis fit we obey.
    For whom shall mass be said?

    _Sieg._ (_faltering_).       For--for--the dead.

    _Prior_. His name?

    _Sieg._           'Tis from a soul, and not a name,
    I would avert perdition.

    _Prior_.                 I meant not
    To pry into your secret. We will pray
    For one unknown, the same as for the proudest.                     480

    _Sieg._ Secret! I have none: but, father, he who's gone
    Might _have_ one; or, in short, he did bequeath--
    No, not bequeath--but I bestow this sum
    For pious purposes.

    _Prior_.            A proper deed
    In the behalf of our departed friends.

    _Sieg._ But he who's gone was not my friend, but foe,
    The deadliest and the stanchest.

    _Prior_.                         Better still!
    To employ our means to obtain Heaven for the souls
    Of our dead enemies is worthy those
    Who can forgive them living.

    _Sieg._                      But I did not                         490
    Forgive this man. I loathed him to the last,
    As he did me. I do not love him now,
    But----

    _Prior_. Best of all! for this is pure religion!
    You fain would rescue him you hate from hell--
    An evangelical compassion--with
    Your own gold too!

    _Sieg._           Father, 'tis not my gold.

    _Prior_. Whose, then? You said it was no legacy.

    _Sieg._ No matter whose--of this be sure, that he
    Who owned it never more will need it, save
    In that which it may purchase from your altars:                    500
    'Tis yours, or theirs.

    _Prior_.               Is there no blood upon it?

    _Sieg._ No; but there's worse than blood--eternal shame!

    _Prior_. Did he who owned it die in his _bed?_

    _Sieg._                                        Alas!
    He did.

    _Prior_. Son! you relapse into revenge,
    If you regret your enemy's bloodless death.

    _Sieg._ His death was fathomlessly deep in blood.

    _Prior_. You said he died in his bed, not battle.

    _Sieg._                                           He
    Died, I scarce know--but--he was stabbed i' the dark,
    And now you have it--perished on his pillow
    By a cut-throat!--Aye!--you may look upon me!                      510
    _I_ am _not_ the man. I'll meet your eye on that point,
    As I can one day God's.

    _Prior_.                Nor did he die
    By means, or men, or instrument of yours?

    _Sieg._ No! by the God who sees and strikes!

    _Prior_.                                     Nor know you
    Who slew him?

    _Sieg._       I could only guess at _one_,
    And he to me a stranger, unconnected,
    As unemployed. Except by one day's knowledge,
    I never saw the man who was suspected.

    _Prior_. Then you are free from guilt.

    _Sieg._ (_eagerly_).                  Oh! _am_ I?--say!

    _Prior_. You have said so, and know best.

    _Sieg._                                   Father! I have spoken    520
    The truth, and nought but truth, if _not_ the _whole_;
    Yet say I am _not_ guilty! for the blood
    Of this man weighs on me, as if I shed it,
    Though, by the Power who abhorreth human blood,
    I did not!--nay, once spared it, when I might
    And _could_--aye, perhaps, _should_ (if our self-safety
    Be e'er excusable in such defences
    Against the attacks of over-potent foes):
    But pray for him, for me, and all my house;
    For, as I said, though I be innocent,
    I know not why, a like remorse is on me,
    As if he had fallen by me or mine. Pray for me,
    Father! I have prayed myself in vain.

    _Prior_.                              I will.
    Be comforted! You are innocent, and should
    Be calm as innocence.

    _Sieg._               But calmness is not
    Always the attribute of innocence.
    I feel it is not.

    _Prior_.          But it will be so,
    When the mind gathers up its truth within it.
    Remember the great festival to-morrow,
    In which you rank amidst our chiefest nobles,
    As well as your brave son; and smooth your aspect,
    Nor in the general orison of thanks
    For bloodshed stopt, let blood you shed not rise,
    A cloud, upon your thoughts. This were to be
    Too sensitive. Take comfort, and forget
    Such things, and leave remorse unto the guilty.             [_Exeunt_.




                                  ACT V.


          SCENE I.--_A large and magnificent Gothic Hall in the
         Castle of Siegendorf, decorated with Trophies, Banners,
                        and Arms of that Family_.

     _Enter_ ARNHEIM _and_ MEISTER, _attendants of_ COUNT SIEGENDORF.

    _Arn._ Be quick! the Count will soon return: the ladies
    Already are at the portal. Have you sent
    The messengers in search of him he seeks for?

    _Meis._ I have, in all directions, over Prague,
    As far as the man's dress and figure could
    By your description track him. The devil take
    These revels and processions! All the pleasure
    (If such there be) must fall to the spectators,--
    I'm sure none doth to us who make the show.

    _Arn._ Go to! my Lady Countess comes.

    _Meis._                              I'd rather                     10
    Ride a day's hunting on an outworn jade,
    Than follow in the train of a great man,
    In these dull pageantries.

    _Arn._                     Begone! and rail
    Within.                                                     [_Exeunt_.

     _Enter the_ COUNTESS JOSEPHINE SIEGENDORF _and_ IDA STRALENHEIM.

    _Jos._ Well, Heaven be praised! the show is over.

    _Ida._ How can you say so? Never have I dreamt
    Of aught so beautiful. The flowers, the boughs,
    The banners, and the nobles, and the knights,
    The gems, the robes, the plumes, the happy faces,
    The coursers, and the incense, and the sun
    Streaming through the stained windows, even the _tombs_,            20
    Which looked so calm, and the celestial hymns,
    Which seemed as if they rather came from Heaven
    Than mounted there--the bursting organ's peal
    Rolling on high like an harmonious thunder;
    The white robes and the lifted eyes; the world
    At peace! and all at peace with one another!
    Oh, my sweet mother!                           [_Embracing_ JOSEPHINE.

    _Jos._               My beloved child!
    For such, I trust, thou shalt be shortly.

    _Ida._                                   Oh!
    I am so already. Feel how my heart beats!

    _Jos._ It does, my love; and never may it throb                     30
    With aught more bitter.

    _Ida._                 Never shall it do so!
    How should it? What should make us grieve? I hate
    To hear of sorrow: how can we be sad,
    Who love each other so entirely? You,
    The Count, and Ulric, and your daughter Ida.

    _Jos._ Poor child!

    _Ida._             Do you pity me?

    _Jos._                            No: I but envy,
    And that in sorrow, not in the world's sense
    Of the universal vice, if one vice be
    More general than another.

    _Ida._                     I'll not hear
    A word against a world which still contains                         40
    You and my Ulric. Did you ever see
    Aught like him? How he towered amongst them all!
    How all eyes followed him! The flowers fell faster--
    Rained from each lattice at his feet, methought,
    Than before all the rest; and where he trod
    I dare be sworn that they grow still, nor e'er
    Will wither.

    _Jos._       You will spoil him, little flatterer,
    If he should hear you.

    _Ida._                 But he never will.
    I dare not say so much to him--I fear him.

    _Jos._ Why so? he loves you well.

    _Ida._                            But I can never                   50
    Shape my thoughts _of_ him into words _to_ him:
    Besides, he sometimes frightens me.

    _Jos._                         How so?
    _Ida._ A cloud comes o'er his blue eyes suddenly,
    Yet he says nothing.

    _Jos._               It is nothing: all men,
    Especially in these dark troublous times,
    Have much to think of.

    _Ida._                 But I cannot think
    Of aught save him.

    _Jos._             Yet there are other men,
    In the world's eye, as goodly. There's, for instance,
    The young Count Waldorf, who scarce once withdrew
    His eyes from yours to-day.

    _Ida._                      I did not see him,                      60
    But Ulric. Did you not see at the moment
    When all knelt, and I wept? and yet, methought,
    Through my fast tears, though they were thick and warm,
    I saw him smiling on me.

    _Jos._                    I could not
    See aught save Heaven, to which my eyes were raised,
    Together with the people's.

    _Ida._                     I thought too
    Of Heaven, although I looked on Ulric.

    _Jos._                                Come,
    Let us retire! they will be here anon,
    Expectant of the banquet. We will lay
    Aside these nodding plumes and dragging trains.                     70

    _Ida._ And, above all, these stiff and heavy jewels,
    Which make my head and heart ache, as both throb
    Beneath their glitter o'er my brow and zone.
    Dear mother, I am with you.

            _Enter_ COUNT SIEGENDORF, _in full dress, from the
                         solemnity_, and LUDWIG.

    _Sieg._                     Is he not found?

    _Lud._ Strict search is making every where; and if
    The man be in Prague, be sure he will be found.

    _Sieg._ Where's Ulric?

    _Lud._                He rode round the other way
    With some young nobles; but he left them soon;
    And, if I err not, not a minute since
    I heard his Excellency, with his train,                             80
    Gallop o'er the west drawbridge.

                    _Enter ULRIC, splendidly dressed_.

    _Sieg._ (_to_ LUDWIG).            See they cease not
    Their quest of him I have described.                   [_Exit_ LUDWIG.
                                        Oh, Ulric!
    How have I longed for thee!

    _Ulr._                     Your wish is granted--
    Behold me!

    _Sieg._   I have seen the murderer.

    _Ulr._ Whom? Where?

    _Sieg._             The Hungarian, who slew Stralenheim.

    _Ulr._ You dream.

    _Sieg._           I live! and as I live, I saw him--
    Heard him! he dared to utter even my name.

    _Ulr._ What name?

    _Sieg._            Werner! _'twas_ mine.

    _Ulr._                                  It must be so
    No more: forget it.

    _Sieg._             Never! never! all
    My destinies were woven in that name:                               90
    It will not be engraved upon my tomb,
    But it may lead me there.

    _Ulr._                   To the point----the Hungarian?

    _Sieg._ Listen!--The church was thronged: the hymn was raised;
    "_Te Deum_" pealed from nations rather than
    From choirs, in one great cry of "God be praised"
    For one day's peace, after thrice ten dread years,
    Each bloodier than the former: I arose,
    With all the nobles, and as I looked down
    Along the lines of lifted faces,--from
    Our bannered and escutcheoned gallery, I                           100
    Saw, like a flash of lightning (for I saw
    A moment and no more), what struck me sightless
    To all else--the Hungarian's face! I grew
    Sick; and when I recovered from the mist
    Which curled about my senses, and again
    Looked down, I saw him not. The thanksgiving
    Was over, and we marched back in procession.

    _Ulr._ Continue.

    _Sieg._          When we reached the Muldau's bridge,
    The joyous crowd above, the numberless
    Barks manned with revellers in their best garbs,                   110
    Which shot along the glancing tide below,
    The decorated street, the long array,
    The clashing music, and the thundering
    Of far artillery, which seemed to bid
    A long and loud farewell to its great doings,
    The standards o'er me, and the tramplings round,
    The roar of rushing thousands,--all--all could not
    Chase this man from my mind, although my senses
    No longer held him palpable.

    _Ulr._                       You saw him
    No more, then?

    _Sieg._        I looked, as a dying soldier                        120
    Looks at a draught of water, for this man;
    But still I saw him not; but in his stead----

    _Ulr._ What in his stead?

    _Sieg._                  My eye for ever fell
    Upon your dancing crest; the loftiest.
    As on the loftiest and the loveliest head,
    It rose the highest of the stream of plumes,
    Which overflowed the glittering streets of Prague.

    _Ulr._ What's this to the Hungarian?

    _Sieg._                              Much! for I
    Had almost then forgot him in my son;
    When just as the artillery ceased, and paused                      130
    The music, and the crowd embraced in lieu
    Of shouting, I heard in a deep, low voice,
    Distinct and keener far upon my ear
    Than the late cannon's volume, this word--"_Werner!_"

    _Ulr._ Uttered by----

    _Sieg._                HIM! I turned--and saw--and fell.

    _Ulr._ And wherefore? Were you seen?

    _Sieg._                              The officious care
    Of those around me dragged me from the spot,
    Seeing my faintness, ignorant of the cause:
    You, too, were too remote in the procession
    (The old nobles being divided from their children)                 140
    To aid me.

    _Ulr._    But I'll aid you now.

    _Sieg._                        In what?

    _Ulr._ In searching for this man, or----When he's found,
    What shall we do with him?

    _Sieg._                   I know not that.

    _Ulr._ Then wherefore seek?

    _Sieg._                     Because I cannot rest
    Till he is found. His fate, and Stralenheim's,
    And ours, seem intertwisted! nor can be
    Unravelled, till----

                          _Enter an_ ATTENDANT.

    _Atten._            A stranger to wait on
    Your Excellency.

    _Sieg._         Who?

    _Atten._            He gave no name.

    _Sieg._ Admit him, ne'ertheless.
               [_The_ ATTENDANT _introduces_ GABOR, _and afterwards exit_.
                                    Ah!

    _Gab._                             'Tis then Werner!

    _Sieg._ (_haughtily_).
    The same you knew, sir, by that name; and _you!_                   150

    _Gab._ (_looking round_).
    I recognise you both: father and son,
    It seems. Count, I have heard that you, or yours,
    Have lately been in search of me: I am here.

    _Sieg._ I have sought you, and have found you: you are charged
    (Your own heart may inform you why) with such
    A crime as----                                           [_He pauses_.

    _Gab._       Give it utterance, and then
    I'll meet the consequences.

    _Sieg._                    You shall do so--
    Unless----

    _Gab._ First, who accuses me?

    _Sieg._                       All things,
    If not all men: the universal rumour--
    My own presence on the spot--the place--the time--                 160
    And every speck of circumstance unite
    To fix the blot on you.

    _Gab._                 And on _me only?_
    Pause ere you answer: is no other name,
    Save mine, stained in this business?

    _Sieg._                             Trifling villain!
    Who play'st with thine own guilt! Of all that breathe
    Thou best dost know the innocence of him
    'Gainst whom thy breath would blow thy bloody slander.
    But I will talk no further with a wretch,
    Further than justice asks. Answer at once,
    And without quibbling, to my charge.

    _Gab._                              'Tis false!                    170

    _Sieg._ Who says so?

    _Gab._               I.

    _Sieg._                And how disprove it?

    _Gab._                                     By
    The presence of the murderer.

    _Sieg._                      Name him.

    _Gab._                                He
    May have more names than one. Your Lordship had so
    Once on a time.

    _Sieg._         If you mean me, I dare
    Your utmost.

    _Gab._       You may do so, and in safety;
    I know the assassin.

    _Sieg._              Where is he?

    _Gab._ (_pointing to_ ULRIC).         Beside you!
         [ULRIC _rushes forward to attack_ GABOR; SIEGENDORF _interposes_.

    _Sieg._ Liar and fiend! but you shall not be slain;
    These walls are mine, and you are safe within them.
    Ulric, repel this calumny, as I                  [_He turns to_ ULRIC.
    Will do. I avow it is a growth so monstrous,                       180
    I could not deem it earth-born: but be calm;
    It will refute itself. But touch him not.
                                   [ULRIC _endeavours to compose himself_.

    _Gab._ Look at _him_, Count, and then _hear me_.

    _Sieg._ (_first to_ GABOR, _and then looking at_ ULRIC).
                                                        I hear thee.
    My God! you look----

    _Ulr._              How?

    _Sieg._                 As on that dread night,
    When we met in the garden.

    _Ulr._ (_composing himself_). It is nothing.

    _Gab._ Count, you are bound to hear me. I came hither
    Not seeking you, but sought. When I knelt down
    Amidst the people in the church, I dreamed not
    To find the beggared Werner in the seat
    Of Senators and Princes; but you have called me,                   190
    And we have met.

    _Sieg._          Go on, sir.

    _Gab._                      Ere I do so,
    Allow me to inquire, who profited
    By Stralenheim's death? Was't I--as poor as ever;
    And poorer by suspicion on my name!
    The Baron lost in that last outrage neither
    Jewels nor gold; his life alone was sought.--
    A life which stood between the claims of others
    To honours and estates scarce less than princely.

    _Sieg._ These hints, as vague as vain, attach no less
    To me than to my son.

    _Gab._                I can't help that.                           200
    But let the consequence alight on him
    Who feels himself the guilty one amongst us.
    I speak to you, Count Siegendorf, because
    I know you innocent, and deem you just.
    But ere I can proceed--_dare_ you protect me?
    _Dare_ you command me?

                   [SIEGENDORF _first looks at the Hungarian, and then at_
                       ULRIC, _who has unbuckled his sabre, and is drawing
                         lines with it on the floor--still in its sheath_.

    _Ulr._ (_looks at his father, and says_,) Let the man go on!

    _Gab._ I am unarmed, Count, bid your son lay down
    His sabre.

    _Ulr._ (_offers it to him contemptuously_). Take it.

    _Gab._                                            No, sir, 'tis enough
    That we are both unarmed--I would not choose
    To wear a steel which may be stained with more                     210
    Blood than came there in battle.

    _Ulr._ (_casts the sabre from him in contempt_). It--or some
    Such other weapon in my hand--spared yours
    Once, when disarmed and at my mercy.

    _Gab._                              True--
    I have not forgotten it: you spared me for
    Your own especial purpose--to sustain
    An ignominy not my own.

    _Ulr._                  Proceed.
    The tale is doubtless worthy the relater.
    But is it of my father to hear further?              [_To_ SIEGENDORF.

    _Sieg._ (_takes his son by the hand_).
    My son, I know my own innocence, and doubt not
    Of yours--but I have promised this man patience;                   220
    Let him continue.

    _Gab._            I will not detain you,
    By speaking of myself much: I began
    Life early--and am what the world has made me.
    At Frankfort on the Oder, where I passed
    A winter in obscurity, it was
    My chance at several places of resort
    (Which I frequented sometimes, but not often)
    To hear related a strange circumstance
    In February last. A martial force,
    Sent by the state, had, after strong resistance,                   230
    Secured a band of desperate men, supposed
    Marauders from the hostile camp.--They proved,
    However, not to be so--but banditti,
    Whom either accident or enterprise
    Had carried from their usual haunt--the forests
    Which skirt Bohemia--even into Lusatia.
    Many amongst them were reported of
    High rank--and martial law slept for a time.
    At last they were escorted o'er the frontiers,
    And placed beneath the civil jurisdiction                          240
    Of the free town of Frankfort. Of _their_ fate
    I know no more.

    _Sieg._         And what is this to Ulric?

    _Gab._ Amongst them there was said to be one man
    Of wonderful endowments:--birth and fortune,
    Youth, strength, and beauty, almost superhuman,
    And courage as unrivalled, were proclaimed
    His by the public rumour; and his sway,
    Not only over his associates, but
    His judges, was attributed to witchcraft,
    Such was his influence:--I have no great faith                     250
    In any magic save that of the mine--
    I therefore deemed him wealthy.--But my soul
    Was roused with various feelings to seek out
    This prodigy, if only to behold him.

    _Sieg._ And did you so?

    _Gab._                  You'll hear. Chance favoured me:
    A popular affray in the public square
    Drew crowds together--it was one of those
    Occasions where men's souls look out of them,
    And show them as they are--even in their faces:
    The moment my eye met his, I exclaimed,                            260
    "This is the man!" though he was then, as since,
    With the nobles of the city. I felt sure
    I had not erred, and watched him long and nearly;
    I noted down his form--his gesture--features,
    Stature, and bearing--and amidst them all,
    'Midst every natural and acquired distinction,
    I could discern, methought, the assassin's eye
    And gladiator's heart.

    _Ulr._ (_smiling_). The tale sounds well.

    _Gab._ And may sound better.--He appeared to me
    One of those beings to whom Fortune bends,                         270
    As she doth to the daring--and on whom
    The fates of others oft depend; besides,
    An indescribable sensation drew me
    Near to this man, as if my point of fortune
    Was to be fixed by him.--There I was wrong.

    _Sieg._ And may not be right now.

    _Gab._                            I followed him,
    Solicited his notice--and obtained it--
    Though not his friendship:--it was his intention
    To leave the city privately--we left it
    Together--and together we arrived                                  280
    In the poor town where Werner was concealed,
    And Stralenheim was succoured----Now we are on
    The verge--_dare_ you hear further?

    _Sieg._                             I must do so--
    Or I have heard too much.

    _Gab._                   I saw in you
    A man above his station--and if not
    So high, as now I find you, in my then
    Conceptions, 'twas that I had rarely seen
    Men such as you appeared in height of mind,
    In the most high of worldly rank; you were
    Poor, even to all save rags: I would have shared                   290
    My purse, though slender, with you--you refused it.

    _Sieg._ Doth my refusal make a debt to you,
    That thus you urge it?

    _Gab._                 Still you owe me something,
    Though not for that; and I owed you my safety,
    At least my seeming safety, when the slaves
    Of Stralenheim pursued me on the grounds
    That _I_ had robbed him.

    _Sieg._                  _I_ concealed you--I,
    Whom and whose house you arraign, reviving viper!

    _Gab._ I accuse no man--save in my defence.
    You, Count, have made yourself accuser--judge:                     300
    Your hall's my court, your heart is my tribunal.
    Be just, and _I'll_ be merciful!

    _Sieg._                          You merciful?--
    You! Base calumniator!

    _Gab._                 I. 'Twill rest
    With me at last to be so. You concealed me--
    In secret passages known to yourself,
    You said, and to none else. At dead of night,
    Weary with watching in the dark, and dubious
    Of tracing back my way, I saw a glimmer,
    Through distant crannies, of a twinkling light:
    I followed it, and reached a door--a secret                        310
    Portal--which opened to the chamber, where,
    With cautious hand and slow, having first undone
    As much as made a crevice of the fastening,
    I looked through and beheld a purple bed,
    And on it Stralenheim!--

    _Sieg._                  Asleep! And yet
    You slew him!--Wretch!

    _Gab._                He was already slain,
    And bleeding like a sacrifice. My own
    Blood became ice.

    _Sieg._           But he was all alone!
    You saw none else? You did not see the----
                                              [_He pauses from agitation_.

    _Gab._                                    No,
    _He_, whom you dare not name, nor even I                           320
    Scarce dare to recollect, was not then in
    The chamber.

    _Sieg._ (_to_ ULRIC). Then, my boy! thou art guiltless still--
    Thou bad'st me say _I_ was so once.--Oh! now
    Do thou as much.

    _Gab._           Be patient! I can _not_
    Recede now, though it shake the very walls
    Which frown above us. You remember,--or
    If not, your son does,--that the locks were changed
    Beneath _his_ chief inspection on the morn
    Which led to this same night: how he had entered
    He best knows--but within an antechamber,                          330
    The door of which was half ajar, I saw
    A man who washed his bloody hands, and oft
    With stern and anxious glance gazed back upon--
    The bleeding body--but it moved no more.

    _Sieg._ Oh! God of fathers!

    _Gab._                      I beheld his features
    As I see yours--but yours they were not, though
    Resembling them--behold them in Count Ulric's!
    Distinct as I beheld them, though the expression
    Is not now what it then was!--but it was so
    When I first charged him with the crime--so lately.                340

    _Sieg._ This is so--

    _Gab._ (_interrupting him_). Nay--but hear me to the end!
    _Now_ you must do so.--I conceived myself
    Betrayed by you and _him_ (for now I saw
    There was some tie between you) into this
    Pretended den of refuge, to become
    The victim of your guilt; and my first thought
    Was vengeance: but though armed with a short poniard
    (Having left my sword without), I was no match
    For him at any time, as had been proved
    That morning--either in address or force.                          350
    I turned and fled--i' the dark: chance rather than
    Skill made me gain the secret door of the hall,
    And thence the chamber where you slept: if I
    Had found you _waking_, Heaven alone can tell
    What vengeance and suspicion might have prompted;
    But ne'er slept guilt as Werner slept that night.

    _Sieg._ And yet I had horrid dreams! and such brief sleep,
    The stars had not gone down when I awoke.
    Why didst thou spare me? I dreamt of my father--
    And now my dream is out!

    _Gab._                  'Tis not my fault,                         360
    If I have read it.--Well! I fled and hid me--
    Chance led me here after so many moons--
    And showed me Werner in Count Siegendorf!
    Werner, whom I had sought in huts in vain,
    Inhabited the palace of a sovereign!
    You sought me and have found me--now you know
    My secret, and may weigh its worth.

    _Sieg._ (_after a pause_).           Indeed!

    _Gab._ Is it revenge or justice which inspires
    Your meditation?

    _Sieg._         Neither--I was weighing
    The value of your secret.

    _Gab._                    You shall know it                        370
    At once:--When you were poor, and I, though poor,
    Rich enough to relieve such poverty
    As might have envied mine, I offered you
    My purse--you would not share it:--I'll be franker
    With you: you are wealthy, noble, trusted by
    The imperial powers--you understand me?

    _Sieg._                                 Yes.

    _Gab._ Not quite. You think me venal, and scarce true:
    'Tis no less true, however, that my fortunes
    Have made me both at present. You shall aid me:
    I would have aided you--and also have                              380
    Been somewhat damaged in my name to save
    Yours and your son's. Weigh well what I have said.

    _Sieg._ Dare you await the event of a few minutes'
    Deliberation?

    _Gab._ (_casts his eyes on_ ULRIC, _who is
    leaning against a pillar_).   If I should do so?

    _Sieg._ I pledge my life for yours. Withdraw into
    This tower.                                    [_Opens a turret-door_.

    _Gab._ (_hesitatingly_). This is the second _safe_ asylum
    You have offered me.

    _Sieg._             And was not the first so?

    _Gab._ I know not that even now--but will approve
    The second. I have still a further shield.--
    I did not enter Prague alone; and should I                         390
    Be put to rest with Stralenheim, there are
    Some tongues without will wag in my behalf.
    Be brief in your decision![200]

    _Sieg._                   I will be so.--
    My word is sacred and irrevocable
    Within _these_ walls, but it extends no further.

    _Gab._ I'll take it for so much.

    _Sieg._ (_points to_ ULRIC'S _sabre, still upon the ground_).
                                   Take also _that_--
    I saw you eye it eagerly, and him
    Distrustfully.

    _Gab._ (_takes up the sabre_). I will; and so provide
    To sell my life--not cheaply.
                 [GABOR _goes into the turret, which_ SIEGENDORF _closes_.

    _Sieg._ (_advances to_ ULRIC). Now, Count Ulric!
    For son I dare not call thee--What say'st thou?                    400

    _Ulr._ His tale is true.

    _Sieg._                  True, monster!

    _Ulr._                                 Most true, father!
    And you did well to listen to it: what
    We know, we can provide against. He must
    Be silenced.

    _Sieg._      Aye, with half of my domains;
    And with the other half, could he and thou
    Unsay this villany.

    _Ulr._             It is no time
    For trifling or dissembling. I have said
    His story's true; and he too must be silenced.

    _Sieg._ How so?

    _Ulr._          As Stralenheim is. Are you so dull
    As never to have hit on this before?                               410
    When we met in the garden, what except
    Discovery in the act could make me know
    His death? Or had the Prince's household been
    Then summoned, would the cry for the police
    Been left to such a stranger? Or should I
    Have loitered on the way? Or could _you, Werner_,
    The object of the Baron's hate and fears,
    Have fled, unless by many an hour before
    Suspicion woke? I sought and fathomed you,
    Doubting if you were false or feeble: I                            420
    Perceived you were the latter: and yet so
    Confiding have I found you, that I doubted
    At times your weakness.

    _Sieg._                 Parricide! no less
    Than common stabber! What deed of my life,
    Or thought of mine, could make you deem me fit
    For your accomplice?

    _Ulr._               Father, do not raise
    The devil you cannot lay between us. This
    Is time for union and for action, not
    For family disputes. While _you_ were tortured,
    Could _I_ be calm? Think you that I have heard                     430
    This fellow's tale without some feeling?--You
    Have taught me feeling for _you_ and myself;
    For whom or what else did you ever teach it?

    _Sieg._ Oh! my dead father's curse! 'tis working now.

    _Ulr._ Let it work on! the grave will keep it down!
    Ashes are feeble foes: it is more easy
    To baffle such, than countermine a mole,
    Which winds its blind but living path beneath you.
    Yet hear me still!--If _you_ condemn me, yet,
    Remember _who_ hath taught me once too often                       440
    To listen to him! _Who_ proclaimed to me
    That _there were crimes_ made venial by the occasion?
    That passion was our nature? that the goods
    Of Heaven waited on the goods of fortune?
    _Who_ showed me his humanity secured
    By his _nerves_ only? _Who_ deprived me of
    All power to vindicate myself and race
    In open day? By his disgrace which stamped
    (It might be) bastardy on me, and on
    Himself--a _felon's_ brand! The man who is                         450
    At once both warm and weak invites to deeds
    He longs to do, but dare not. Is it strange
    That I should _act_ what you could _think?_ We have done
    With right and wrong; and now must only ponder
    Upon effects, not causes. Stralenheim,
    Whose life I saved from impulse, as _unknown_,
    I would have saved a peasant's or a dog's, I slew
    _Known_ as our foe--but not from vengeance. He
    Was a rock in our way which I cut through,
    As doth the bolt, because it stood between us                      460
    And our true destination--but not idly.
    As stranger I preserved him, and he _owed me_
    His _life_: when due, I but resumed the debt.
    He, you, and I stood o'er a gulf wherein
    I have plunged our enemy. _You_ kindled first
    The torch--_you_ showed the path; now trace me that
    Of safety--or let me!

    _Sieg._               I have done with life!

    _Ulr._ Let us have done with that which cankers life--
    Familiar feuds and vain recriminations
    Of things which cannot be undone. We have                          470
    No more to learn or hide: I know no fear,
    And have within these very walls men who
    (Although you know them not) dare venture all things.
    You stand high with the state; what passes here
    Will not excite her too great curiosity:
    Keep your own secret, keep a steady eye,
    Stir not, and speak not;--leave the rest to me:
    We must have no _third_ babblers thrust between us.
                                                            [_Exit_ ULRIC.

    _Sieg._ (_solus_). Am I awake? are these my father's halls?
    And _you_--my son? _My_ son! _mine!_ I who have ever               480
    Abhorred both mystery and blood, and yet
    Am plunged into the deepest hell of both!
    I must be speedy, or more will be shed--
    The Hungarian's!--Ulric--he hath partisans,
    It seems: I might have guessed as much. Oh fool!
    Wolves prowl in company. He hath the key
    (As I too) of the opposite door which leads
    Into the turret. Now then! or once more
    To be the father of fresh crimes, no less
    Than of the criminal! Ho! Gabor! Gabor!                            490
                      [_Exit into the turret, closing the door after him_.


                 SCENE II.--_The Interior of the Turret_.

                         GABOR _and_ SIEGENDORF.

    _Gab._ Who calls?

    _Sieg._           I--Siegendorf! Take these and fly!
    Lose not a moment!

                  [_Tears off a diamond star and other jewels, and thrusts
                        them into_ GABOR'S _hand_.

    _Gab._               What am I to do
    With these?

    _Sieg._    Whate'er you will: sell them, or hoard,
    And prosper; but delay not, or you are lost!

    _Gab._ You pledged your honour for my safety!

    _Sieg._                                        And
    Must thus redeem it. Fly! I am not master,
    It seems, of my own castle--of my own
    Retainers--nay, even of these very walls,
    Or I would bid them fall and crush me! Fly!
    Or you will be slain by----

    _Gab._                      Is it even so?                          10
    Farewell, then! Recollect, however, Count,
    You sought this fatal interview!

    _Sieg._                          I did:
    Let it not be more fatal still!--Begone!

    _Gab._ By the same path I entered?

    _Sieg._                           Yes; that's safe still;
    But loiter not in Prague;--you do not know
    With whom you have to deal.

    _Gab._                     I know too well--
    And knew it ere yourself, unhappy Sire!
    Farewell!                                               [_Exit_ GABOR.

    _Sieg._ (_solus and listening_).
              He hath cleared the staircase. Ah! I hear
    The door sound loud behind him! He is safe!
    Safe!--Oh, my father's spirit!--I am faint--                        20

                       [_He leans down upon a stone seat, near the wall of
                             the tower, in a drooping posture_.

        _Enter_ ULRIC _with others armed, and with weapons drawn_.

    _Ulr._ Despatch!--he's there!

    _Lud._                       The Count, my Lord!

    _Ulr._ (_recognizing_ SIEGENDORF).              _You_ here, sir!

    _Sieg._ Yes: if you want another victim, strike!

    _Ulr._ (_seeing him stript of his jewels_).
    Where is the ruffian who hath plundered you?
    Vassals, despatch in search of him! You see
    'Twas as I said--the wretch hath stript my father
    Of jewels which might form a Prince's heir-loom!
    Away! I'll follow you forthwith.
                                 [_Exeunt all but_ SIEGENDORF _and_ ULRIC.
                                    What's this?
    Where is the villain?

    _Sieg._            There are _two_, sir: which
    Are you in quest of?

    _Ulr._              Let us hear no more
    Of this: he must be found. You have not let him                     30
    Escape?

    _Sieg._ He's gone.

    _Ulr._             With your connivance?

    _Sieg._                                 With
    My fullest, freest aid.

    _Ulr._                 Then fare you well!
                                                        [ULRIC _is going_.

    _Sieg._ Stop! I command--entreat--implore! Oh, Ulric!
    Will you then leave me?

    _Ulr._                  What! remain to be
    Denounced--dragged, it may be, in chains; and all
    By your inherent weakness, half-humanity,
    Selfish remorse, and temporizing pity,
    That sacrifices your whole race to save
    A wretch to profit by our ruin! No, Count,
    Henceforth you have no son!

    _Sieg._                     I never had one;                        40
    And would you ne'er had borne the useless name!
    Where will you go? I would not send you forth
    Without protection.

    _Ulr._              Leave that unto me.
    I am not alone; nor merely the vain heir
    Of your domains; a thousand, aye, ten thousand
    Swords, hearts, and hands are mine.

    _Sieg._                             The foresters!
    With whom the Hungarian found you first at Frankfort!

    _Ulr._ Yes--men--who are worthy of the name! Go tell
    Your Senators that they look well to Prague;
    Their Feast of Peace was early for the times;                       50
    There are more spirits abroad than have been laid
    With Wallenstein!

                       _Enter_ JOSEPHINE _and_ IDA.

    _Jos._              What is't we hear? My Siegendorf!
    Thank Heaven, I see you safe!

    _Sieg._                      Safe!

    _Ida._                           Yes, dear father!

    _Sieg._ No, no; I have no children: never more
    Call me by that worst name of parent.

    _Jos._                                What
    Means my good Lord?

    _Sieg._             That you have given birth
    To a demon!

    _Ida_ (_taking_ ULRIC'S _hand_). Who shall dare say this of Ulric?

    _Sieg._ Ida, beware! there's blood upon that hand.

    _Ida_ (_stooping to kiss it_).
    I'd kiss it off, though it were mine.

    _Sieg._                              It is so!

    _Ulr._ Away! it is your father's!                       [_Exit_ ULRIC.

    _Ida._                            Oh, great God!                    60
    And I have loved this man!
        [IDA _falls senseless_--JOSEPHINE _stands speechless with horror_.

    _Sieg._                    The wretch hath slain
    Them both!--My Josephine! we are now alone!
    Would we had ever been so!--All is over
    For me!--Now open wide, my sire, thy grave;
    Thy curse hath dug it deeper for thy son
    In mine!--The race of Siegendorf is past.

                 The end of the fifth act and the Drama.

FOOTNOTES:

[159] {337}[This is not correct. _The Young Lady's Tale, or the Two
Emilys_ and _The Clergyman's Tale, or Pembroke_, were contributed by
Sophia Lee. _Kruitzner, or The Germans Tale_, was written by Harriet Lee
(1757-1851), the younger of the sisters. Miss Lee began her literary
career as a dramatist. A comedy, _The New Peerage; or, Our Eyes may
deceive us_, was played at Drury Lane, November 10, 1787. In 1798 she
published _The Mysterious Marriage; or, The Heirship of Rosalva_. After
the publication of Byron's _Werner_, she wrote a dramatic version of
_The German's Tale_, under the title of _The Three Strangers_. It was
brought out at Covent Garden, December 10, 1825, and acted four times.

The first volume of the _Canterbury Tales_, by Harriet Lee, was
published in 1797; the second volume, by Sophia Lee, in 1798 (a second
edition of these volumes was published in 1799); a third volume (second
edition), by Sophia and Harriet Lee, appeared in 1800; the fourth
volume, by Harriet Lee (which contains _The German's Tale_, pp. 3-368)
was published in 1801; and the fifth volume, by Harriet Lee, in 1805.

There can be little doubt that Byron's visit to Churchill's grave at
Dover, which took place April 25, 1816 (see _Poetical Works_, 1901, iv.
45), was suggested by a passage in the _Introduction_, pp. vii.-ix., to
the first volume (1797) of the _Canterbury Tales_. The author "wanders
forth to note the _memorabilia_ of Dover," is informed that "the
greatest curiosity in the place is the tomb of a poet," and hastens "to
a spot surrounded by ruined walls, in the midst of which stood the white
marble tablet marked with Churchill's name," etc.]

[cm] {338} [_Of England or any other country. It may seem unnecessary to
add this, but having seen a poem of mine never intended for
representation, dragged in spite of my remonstrance upon the theatres of
more than one nation, I trust it will not be deemed impertinent if I
once more repeat my protest against_ [_a gross_] _folly which may injure
me--and_ [_benefit_] _no one. If it be understood that_ all dramatic
_writing is generically intended for the stage, I deny it_[*]. _With the
exception of Shakespeare_ (_or Tate, Cibber, and Thompson under his
name_), _not one in fifty plays of our dramatists is ever acted, however
much they may be read. Only_ one _of Massinger--none of Ford--none of
Marlowe_, one _of Ben Jonson--none of Webster, none of Heywood: and,
even in Comedy, Congreve is rarely acted, and that in only one of his
plays. Neither is Joanna Baillie. I am far from attempting to raise
myself to a level with the least of these names--I only wish to be_
[_exempted_] _from a stage which is not theirs. Perhaps Mr. Lamb's essay
upon the effects of dramatic representation on the intelligent
auditor_[**]----_marks are just with regard to this--plays of Shakespeare
himself--the hundredfold to those of others_.--From a mutilated page of
MS. M.]

[*] [Byron is replying to Jeffrey (_Edinburgh Review_, February, 1822,
vol. 36, p. 422). "A drama is not merely a dialogue, but _an action_:
and necessarily supposes that something is to pass before the eyes of
assembled spectators.... If an author does not bear this continually in
his mind, and does not write in the ideal presence of an eager and
diversified assemblage, he may be a poet, perhaps, but assuredly he will
never be a dramatist."]

the plays of Shakespeare are less calculated for performance on a stage
than those of almost any other dramatist whatever."--"On the Tragedies
of Shakespeare," _Complete Works of Charles Lamb_, 1875, p. 255. It was,
too, something of a paradox that Byron should be eager to shelter
himself under the aegis of Charles Lamb. But unpopularity, like poverty,
brings together strange bedfellows.]

[160] {340}[The Thirty Years' War dates from the capture of Pilsen by
Mansfeld, November 21, 1618, and did not end till the Peace of
Westphalia, October 24, 1648. The incident recorded in act v., a solemn
commemoration of the Treaty of Prague, must have taken place in 1635.

[162] {347}[It has been surmised that Byron had some knowledge of the
early life and history of the dramatist Friedrich Ludwig Zacharias
Werner (1768-1823), and that a similarity of character and incident
suggested the renaming of Kruitzner. But the change of name was made in
1815, not in 1821, and it is far more probable that Byron called his
hero "Werner," because "Kruitzner" is unrhythmical, or simply because
"Werner," a common German surname, is not unlike "Werther," which was
"familiar as a household word."]

[163] {348}["Lord Byron's establishment at Pisa was, like everything
else about him, somewhat singular; it consisted of a monkey, a mastiff,
a bull-dog, two cats, ... several servants in livery, and the trusty
Fletcher as _Major Domo_, or superintendant of the _Menagerie_."--_Life,

"It need not, therefore, be a matter of wonder that from the discharged
soldiers numerous bands of robbers ['_bande nere_,' or 'black bands:'

Imperialists.]

[175] {377}[Compare _The Antiquary_, by Sir W. Scott, i. 366, chap. vii.
ed. 1851: "'Good man,' said Sir Arthur, 'can you think of nothing?--of
no help?--I'll make you rich--I'll give you a farm--I'll----' 'Our
riches will soon be equal,' said the beggar, looking upon the strife of
the waters. 'They are sae already; for I hae nae land, and you would give
your fair bounds and barony for a square yard of rock that would be dry
for twal hours.'"--_The Antiquary_ was published in 1816, six years
before the second version of _Werner_ was written, and ten years after
the death of the Duchess of Devonshire.]

[176] {381}[The following is the original passage in the
novel:--"'Stralenheim,' said Conrad, 'does not appear to me altogether
the man you take him for:--but were it even otherwise, he owes me
gratitude not only for the past, but for what he supposes to be my
present employment. I saved his life, and he therefore places confidence
in me. He has been robbed last night--is sick--a stranger--and in no
condition to discover the villain who has plundered him.... and the
business on which I sought the Intendant was chiefly
that.'"--_Canterbury Tales_, by Sophia and Harriet Lee, 1838, ii. 203,
204.]

[177] ["'And who,' said he, 'has entitled you to brand thus with
ignominious epithets a being you do not know? Who ... has taught you
that it would be safe even for my son to insult me?'--'It is not
necessary to know the person of a ruffian,' replied Conrad, indignantly,
'to give him the appellation he merits:--and what is there in common
between my father and such a character?'--'_Everything_,' said
Siegendorf, bitterly,--'for that ruffian was your father!'"--Ibid., p.
204.]

[178] {382}["'Conrad ... before you thus presume to chastise me with your
eye, learn to understand my actions! Young, and inexperienced in the
world--reposing hitherto in the bosom of indulgence and luxury, is it
for _you_ to judge of the impulse of the passions, or the temptations of
misery? Wait till, like me, you have blighted your fairest hopes--have
endured humiliation and sorrow--poverty and insult--before you pretend
to judge of their effect on you! Should that miserable day ever
arrive--should you see the being at your mercy who stands between you
and everything that is dear or noble in life!--who is ready to tear from
you your name--your inheritance--your very life itself--congratulate
your own heart, if, like me, you are content with petty plunder, and are
not tempted to exterminate a serpent, who now lives, perhaps to sting us
all.'"--_Canterbury Tales_, by Sophia and Harriet Lee, 1838, ii. 204,
205.]

[179] {383}["'You do not know this man,' continued he; 'I do!--I believe
him to be mean--sordid--deceitful! You will conceive yourself safe,
because you are young and brave! Learn, however, ... none are so secure
but desperation or subtilty may reach them! Stralenheim, in the palace
of a prince, was in my power! My knife was held over him--a single
moment would have swept him from the face of the earth, and with him all
my future fears:--I forbore--and I am now in his.--Are you certain that
you are not so too? Who assures you he does not know you?--who tells you
that he has not lured you into his society, either to rid himself of you
for ever, or to plunge you with your family into a
dungeon?'"--_Canterbury Tales_, by Sophia and Harriet Lee, 1838, ii. 205.

in spurning now, I have furnished with fresh venom:--will _you_ be more

                              WERNER

                             Nov. 1815.

                           [FIRST DRAFT.]




                                  ACT I.


    SCENE I.--_A ruinous chateau on the Silesian frontier of Bohemia_.

    _Josepha_. THE storm is at it's height--how the wind howls,
    Like an unearthly voice, through these lone chambers!
    And the rain patters on the flapping casement
    Which quivers in it's frame--the night is starless--
    Yet cheerly Werner! still our hearts are warm:
    The tempest is without, or should be so--
    For we are sheltered here where Fortune's clouds
    May roll all harmless o'er us as the wrath
    Of these wild elements that menace now,
    Yet do not reach us.

    _Werner_ (_without attending, and walking disturbedly,
    speaking to himself_). No--'Tis past--'tis blighted,                10
    The last faint hope to which my withered fortune
    Clung with a feeble and a fluttering grasp,
    Yet clung convulsively--for twas the _last_--
    Is broken with the rest: would that my heart were!
    But there is pride, and passion's war within,
    Which give my breast vitality to suffer,
    As it hath suffered through long years till now.
    My father's wrath extends beyond the grave,
    And haunts me in the shape of Stralenheim!
    He revels in my fathers palace--I--                                 20
    Exiled--disherited--a nameless outcast!
                                                         [_Werner pauses_.
    My boy, too, where and what is he?--my father
    Might well have limited his curse to me.
    If that my heritage had passed to Ulric,
    I had not mourned my own less happy lot.
    No--No--all's past--all torn away.

    _Josepha_.                        Dear Werner,
    Oh banish these discomfortable thoughts
    That thus contend within you: we are poor,
    So we have ever been--but I remember
    The time when thy Josepha's smile could turn                        30
    Thy heart to hers--despite of every ill.
    So let it now--alas! you hear me not.

    _Werner_. What said you?--let it pass--no matter what--
    Think me not churlish, Sweet, I am not well.
    My brain is hot and busy--long fatigue
    And last night's watching have oppressed me much.

    _Josepha_. Then get thee to thy couch. I do perceive
    In thy pale cheek and in thy bloodshot eye
    A strange distemperature--nay, as a boon,
    I do entreat thee to thy rest.

    _Werner_.                      My _rest!_                           40
    Well--be it so--Good Night!

    _Josepha_.                 Thy hand is burning;
    I will prepare a potion:--peace be with thee--
    Tomorrow's dawn I trust will find thee healthful;
    And, then, our Ulric may perchance--

    _Werner_. _Our_ Ulric--thine and mine--our only boy--
    Curse on his father and his father's Sire!
    (For, if it is so, I will render back
    A curse that Heaven will hear as well as his),
    Our Ulric by his father's fault or folly,
    And by my father's unrelenting pride,                               50
    Is at this hour, perchance, undone. This night
    That shelters us may shower it's wrath on him--
    A homeless beggar for his parent's sin--
    Thy sin and mine--Thy child and mine atones--
    Our Ulric--Woman!--I'll to no bed to-night--
    There is no pillow for my thoughts.

    _Josepha_.                         What words,
    What fearful words are these! what may they mean?

    _Werner_. Look on me--thou hast known me, hitherto,
    As an oppressed, but yet a humble creature;
    By birth predestined to the yoke I've borne.                        60
    Till now I've borne it patiently, at least,
    In bitter silence--but the hour is come,
    That should and shall behold me as I was,
    And ought again to be--

    _Josepha_.               I know not what
    Thy mystery may tend to, but my fate--
    My heart--my will--my love are linked with thine,
    And I would share thy sorrow: lay it open.

    _Werner_. Thou see'st the son of Count--but let it pass--
    I forfeited the name in wedding thee:
    That fault of many faults a father's pride                          70
    Proclaimed the last and worst--and, from that hour,
    He disavowed, disherited, debased
    A wayward son----tis a long tale--too long--
    And I am heartsick of the heavy thought.

    _Josepha_. Oh, I could weep--but that were little solace:
    Yet tell the rest--or, if thou wilt not, say--
    Yet say--why, through long years, from me withheld,
    This fearful secret that hath gnawed thy soul?

    _Werner_. Why? had it not been base to call on thee
    For patience and for pity--to awake                                 80
    The thirst of grandeur in thy gentle spirit--
    To tell thee what thou shouldst have been--the wife
    Of one, in power--birth--wealth, preeminent--
    Then, sudden quailing in that lofty tone,
    To bid thee soothe thy husband--peasant Werner?

    _Josepha_. I would thou wert, indeed, the peasant Werner;
    For then thy soul had been of calmer mould,
    And suited to thy lot----

    _Werner_.                 Was it not so?
    Beneath a humble name and garb--the which
    My youthful riot and a father's frown,                              90
    Too justly fixed upon me, had compelled
    My bowed down spirit to assume too well--
    Since it deceived the world, myself, and thee:
    I linked my lot irrevocably with thine--
    And I have loved thee deeply--long and dearly--
    Even as I love thee still--but these late crosses,
    And most of all the last,--have maddened me;
    And I am wild and wayward as in youth,
    Ere I beheld thee--

    _Josepha_.          Would thou never hadst!
    Since I have been a blight upon thy hope,                          100
    And marred alike the present and the future.

    _Werner_. Yet say not so--for all that I have known
    Of true and calm content--of love--of peace--
    Has been with thee and from thee: wert thou not,
    I were a lonely and self-loathing thing.
    Ulric has left us! all, save thou, have left me!
    Father and son--Fortune--Fame--Power--Ambition--
    The ties of being--the high soul of man--
    All save the long remorse--the consciousness,
    The curse of living on, regretting life                            110
    Mispent in miserably gazing upward,
    While others soared--Away, I'll think no more.

    _Josepha_. But Ulric--wherefore didst thou let him leave
    His home and us? tis now three weary years.

    _Werner_ (_interrupting her quickly_).
    Since my hard father, half-relenting, sent
    The offer of a scanty stipend which
    I needs must earn by rendering up my son--
    Fool that I was--I thought this quick compliance,
    And never more assuming in myself
    The haught name of my house would soften him--                     120
    And for our child secure the heritage
    Forfeit in me forever. Since that hour,
    Till the last year, the wretched pittance came--
    Then ceased with every tidings of my son
    And Sire--till late I heard the last had ceased
    To live--and unforgiving died--Oh God!

    _Josepha_. Was it for this our Ulric left us so?
    Thou dids't deceive me then--he went not forth
    To join the legions of Count Tilly's war?

    _Werner_. I know not--he had left my father's castle,              130
    Some months before his death--but why?--but why?
    Left it as I did ere his birth, perchance,
    Like me an outcast. Old age had not made
    My father meeker--and my son, Alas!
    Too much his Sire resembled----

    _Josepha_.                     Yet there's comfort.
    Restrain thy wandering Spirit--Ulric cannot
    Have left his native land--thou dost not know,
    Though it looks strangely, thy Sire and he
    In anger parted--Hope is left us still.

    _Werner_. The best hope that I ever held in youth,                 140
    When every pulse was life, each thought a joy,
    (Yet not irrationally sanguine, since
    My birth bespoke high thoughts,) hath lured and left me.
    I will not be a dreamer in mine age--
    The hunter of a shadow--let _boys hope_:
    Of Hope I now know nothing but the name--
    And that's a sound which jars upon my heart.
    I've wearied thee--Good night--my patient Love!

    _Josepha_. I must not leave thee thus--my husband--friend--
    My heart is rent in twain for thee--I scarce                       150
    Dare greet thee as I would, lest that my love
    Should seem officious and ill timed:--'tis early--
    Yet rest were as a healing balm to thee--
    Then once again--Good night!

    _Voice Without_.             What Ho--lights ho!


                                SCENE II.

    _Josepha_. What noise is that? 'tis nearer--hush! they knock.
                         [_A knocking heard at the gate_--WERNER _starts_.

    _Werner_ (_aside_). It may be that the bloodhounds of the villain,
    Who long has tracked me, have approached at last:
    I'll not be taken tamely.

    _Josepha_.                'Twas the voice,
    The single voice of some lone traveller.
    I'll to the door.

    _Werner_.         No--stay thou here--again!
                                     [_Knocking repeated. Opens the door_.
    Well--Sir--your pleasure?

                       _Enter_ CARL _the Bavarian_.

    _Carl_.                   Thanks most worthy Sir!
    My pleasure, for to-night, depends on yours--
    I'm weary, wet, and wayworn--without shelter,
    Unless you please to grant it.

    _Josepha_.                    You shall have it,                    10
    Such as this ruinous mansion may afford:
    Tis spacious, but too cold and crazy now
    For Hospitality's more cordial welcome:
    But as it is 'tis yours.

    _Werner_ (_to his wife_).   Why say ye so?
    At once such hearty greeting to a stranger?
    At such a lonely hour, too--

    _Josepha_ (_in reply to Werner_). Nay--he's honest.
    There is trust-worthiness in his blunt looks.

    _Werner_ (_to Josepha_).
    "Trustworthiness in looks!" I'll trust no looks!
    I look into men's faces for their age,
    Not for their actions--had he Adam's brow,                          20
    Open and goodly as before the fall,
    I've lived too long to trust the frankest aspect.
    (_To Carl_) Whence come you Sir?

    _Carl_.                         From Frankfort, on my way
    To my own country--I've a companion too--
    He tarries now behind:--an hour ago,
    On reaching that same river on your frontier,
    We found it swoln by storms--a stranger's carriage,
    Despite the current, drawn by sturdy mules,
    Essayed to pass, and nearly reached the middle
    Of that which was the _ford_ in gentler weather,                    30
    When down came driver, carriage, mules, and all--
    You may suppose the worthy Lord within
    Fared ill enough:--worse still he might have suffered,
    But that my comrade and myself rushed in,
    And with main strength and some good luck beside,
    Dislodged and saved him: he'll be here anon.
    His equipage by this time is at Dresden--
    I left it floating that way.

    _Werner_.                   Where is he?

    _Carl_. Hitherward on his way, even like myself--
    We saw the light and made for the nearest shelter:                  40
    You'll not deny us for a single night?
    You've room enough, methinks--and this vast ruin
    Will not be worse for three more guests.

    _Werner_.                               Two more:
    And thou?--well--be it so--(_aside_) (tonight will soon
    Be overpast: they shall not stay tomorrow)--
    Know you the name of him you saved?

    _Carl_.                             Not I!
    I think I heard him called a Baron Something--
    But was too chill to stay and hear his titles:
    You know they are sometimes tedious in the reckoning,
    If counted over by the noble wearer.                                50
    Has't any wine? I'm wet, stung to the marrow--
    My comrade waited to escort the Baron:
    They will be here, anon--they, too, want cheering:
    I'll taste for them, if it please you, courteous host!

    _Josepha_. Such as our vintage is shall give you welcome:
    I'll bring you some anon.                                 [_goes out_.

    _Carl_ (_looking round_). A goodly mansion!
    And has been nobly tenanted, I doubt not.
    This worn magnificence some day has shone
    On light hearts and long revels--those torn banners
    Have waved o'er courtly guests--and yon huge lamp                   60
    High blazed through many a midnight--I could wish
    My lot had led me here in those gay times!
    Your days, my host, must pass but heavily.
    Are you the vassal of these antient chiefs,
    Whose heir wastes elsewhere their fast melting hoards,
    And placed to keep their cobwebs company?

    _Werner_ (_who has been absorbed in thought till the latter
    part of his speech_). A Vassal!--I a vassal!--_who_ accosts me
    With such familiar question?--(_checks himself and says
    aside_)--Down startled pride!
    Have not long years of wretchedness yet quenched thee,
    And, suffering evil, wilt thou start at scorn?                      70
    (_To Carl_.) Sir! if I boast no birth--and, as you see,
    My state bespeaks none--still, no being breathes
    Who calls me slave or servant.--Like yourself
    I am a stranger here--a lonely guest--
    But, for a time, on sufferance. On my way,
    From--a far distant city--Sickness seized,
    And long detained me in the neighbouring hamlet.
    The Intendant of the owner of this castle,
    Then uninhabited, with kind intent,
    Permitted me to wait returning health                               80
    Within these walls--more sheltered than the cot
    Of humble peasants.

    _Carl_.             Worthy Sir, your mercy!
    I meant not to offend you--plain of speech,
    And blunt in apprehension, I do judge
    Men's station from their seeming--but themselves
    From acts alone. You bid me share your shelter,
    And I am bound to you; and had you been
    The lowliest vassal had not thanked you less,
    Than I do now, believing you his better,
    Perhaps my own superior--

    _Werner_.                 What imports it?                          90
    What--who I am--or whence--you are welcome--sit--
    You shall have cheer anon. (_walks disturbedly aside_)

    _Carl_ (_to himself_). Here's a strange fellow!
    Wild, churlish, angry--_why_, I know not, seek not.
    Would that the wine were come! my doublet's wet,
    But my throat dry as Summer's drought in desarts.
    Ah--here it sparkles!

       _Enter_ JOSEPHA _with wine in flask--and a cup. As she pours
         it out a Voice is heard without calling at a distance_.
             WERNER _starts_--JOSEPHA _listens tremulously_.

    _Werner_.            That voice--that voice--Hark!
    No--no--tis silent--Sir--I say--that voice--
    Whose is it--speak--

    _Carl_ (_drinking unconcernedly_).
                        Whose is it? faith, I know not--
    And, yet, 'tis my companion's: he's like you,
    And does not care to tell his name and station.                    100
                                            [_The voice again and nearer_.

    _Josepha_. 'Tis his--I knew it--Ulric!--Ulric!--Ulric!
                                     [_She drops the wine and rushes out_.

    _Carl_. The flask's unhurt--but every drop is spilt.
    Confound the voice! I say--would he were dumb!
    And faith! to me, he has been nearly so--
    A silent and unsocial travelling mate.

    _Werner_ (_stands in agitation gazing towards the door_).
    If it be he--I cannot move to meet him.
    Yes--it must be so--there is no such voice
    That so could sound and shake me: he is here,
    And I am--

                           _Enter_ STRALENHEIM.

    _Werner_ (_turns and sees him_). A curse upon thee, stranger!
    Where dids't thou learn a tone so like my boy's?                   110
    Thou mock bird of my hopes--a curse upon thee!
    Out! Out! I say. Thou shalt not harbour here.

    _Stralenheim_. What means the peasant? knows he unto whom
    He dares address this language?

    _Carl_.                         Noble Sir!
    Pray heed him not--he's Phrenzy's next door neighbour,
    And full of these strange starts and causeless jarrings.

    _Werner_. Oh, that long wished for voice!--I dreamed of it--
    And then it did elude me--then--and now.

         _Enter_ ULRIC _and_ JOSEPHA. WERNER _falls on his neck_.

    Oh God! forgive, for thou dids't not forget me.
    Although I murmured--tis--it is my Son!                            120

    _Josepha_. Aye, 'tis dear Ulric--yet, methinks, he's changed, too:
    His cheek is tanned, his frame more firmly knit!
    That scar, too, dearest Ulric--I do fear me--
    Thou hast been battling with these heretics,
    And that's a Swedish token on thy brow.

    _Ulric_. My heart is glad with yours--we meet like those
    Who never would have parted:--of the past
    You shall know more anon--but, here's a guest
    That asks a gentle welcome. Noble Baron,
    My father's silence looks discourtesy:                             130
    Yet must I plead his pardon--'tis his love
    Of a long truant that has rapt him, thus,
    From hospitable greeting--you'll be seated--
    And, Father, we will sup like famished hunters.

                         JOSEPHA _goes out here_.

    _Stralenheim_. I have much need of rest: no more refreshment!
    Were all my people housed within the hamlet,
    Or can they follow?

    _Ulric_.           Not to night I fear.
    They staid in hope the damaged Cabriole
    Might, with the dawn of day, have such repairs,
    As circumstance admits of.

    _Carl_.                    Nay--that's hopeless.                   140
    They must not only mend but draw it too.
    The mules are drowned--a murrain on them both!
    One kicked me as I would have helped him on.

    _Stralenheim_. It is most irksome to me--this delay.
    I was for Prague on business of great moment.

    _Werner_. For Prague--Sir--Say you?--

    _Stralenheim_.                        Yes, my host! for Prague.
    And these vile floods and villainous cross roads
    Steal my time from it's uses--but--my people?
    Where do they shelter?

    _Ulric_.               In the boatman's shed,
    Near to the ferry: you mistook the ford--                          150
    Tis higher to the right:--their entertainment
    Will be but rough--but 'tis a single night,
    And they had best be guardians of the baggage.
    The shed will hold the weather from their sleep,
    The woodfire warm them--and, for beds, a cloak
    Is swansdown to a seasoned traveller:
    It has been mine for many a moon, and may
    Tonight, for aught it recks me.

    _Stralenheim_.                  And tomorrow
    I must be on my journey--and betimes.
    It is not more than three days travel, hence,                      160
    To Mansfeldt Castle.

    _Werner and Ulric_. Mansfeldt Castle!--

    _Stralenheim_.                           Aye!
    For thither tends my progress--so, betimes,
    Mine host I would be stirring--think of that!
    And let me find my couch of rest at present.

    _Werner_. You shall Sir--but--to Mansfeldt!--
                          [ULRIC _stops his father and says aside to him_,
                                                 _Silence--father--_
    Whate'er it be that shakes you thus--_tread down_--
    (_To Stralenheim_) My father, Sir, was born not far from Prague,
    And knows it's environs--and, when he hears,
    The name endeared to him by native thoughts,
    He would ask of it, and it's habitants--                           170
    You will excuse his plain blunt mode of question.

    _Stralenheim_. Indeed, perchance, then, he may aid my search.
    Pray, know you aught of one named Werner? who
    (But he no doubt has passed through many names),
    Lived long in Hamburgh--and has thence been traced
    Into Silesia--and not far from hence--
    But there we lost him; he who can disclose
    Aught of him, or his hiding-place, will find
    Advantage in revealing it.

    _Ulric_.                  Why so--Sir?

    _Stralenheim_. There are strong reasons to suspect this man        180
    Of crimes against the State--league with Swedes--
    And other evil acts of moment:--he
    Who shall deliver him, bound hand and foot,
    Will benefit his country and himself:
    I will reward him doubly too.

    _Ulric_.                      You know him?

    _Stralenheim_. He never met my eyes--but Circumstance
    Has led me to near knowledge of the man.
    He is a villain--and an enemy
    To all men--most to me! If earth contain him,
    He shall be found and fettered: I have hopes,                      190
    By traces which tomorrow will unravel,
    A fresh clue to his lurking spot is nigh.

    _Carl_. And, if I find it, I will break the thread.
    What, all the world against one luckless wight!
    And he a fugitive--I would I knew him!

    _Ulric_. You'd help him to escape--is it not so?

    _Carl_. I would, indeed!

    _Ulric_.                 The greater greenhorn you!
    I would secure him--nay--I will do so.

    _Stralenheim_. If it be so--my gratitude for aid,
    And rescue of my life from the wild waters,                        200
    Will double in it's strength and it's requital.
    Your father, too, perhaps can help our search?

    _Werner_. _I_ turn a spy--no--not for _Mansfeldt Castle_,
    And all the broad domain it frowns upon.

    _Stralenheim_. Mansfeldt again!--you know it then? perchance,
    You also know the story of it's lords?

    _Werner_. Whate'er I know, there is no bribe of thine
    Can swerve me to the crooked path thou pointest.
    The chamber's ready, which your rest demands.

    _Stralenheim_ (_aside_).
    'Tis strange--this peasant's tone is wondrous high,                210
    His air imperious--and his eye shines out
    As wont to look command with a quick glance--
    His garb befits him not--why, he may be
    The man I look for! now, I look again,
    There is the very lip--short curling lip--
    And the oerjutting eye-brow dark and large,
    And the peculiar wild variety
    Of feature, even unto the Viper's eye,
    Of that detested race, and it's descendant
    Who stands alone between me and a power,                           220
    Which Princes gaze at with unquiet eyes!
    This is no peasant--but, whate'er he be,
    Tomorrow shall secure him and unfold.

    _Ulric_. It will not please you, Sir, then to remain
    With us beyond tomorrow?

    _Stralenheim_. Nay--I do not say so--there is no haste.
    And now I think again--I'll tarry here--
    Perhaps until the floods abate--we'll see--
    In the mean time--to my chamber--so--Good Night!
                                                      [_Exit with_ WERNER.

    _Werner_. This way, Sir.

    _Carl_. And I to mine: pray, where are we to rest?                 230
    We'll sup within--

    _Ulric_.          What matter where--there's room.

    _Carl_. I would fain see my way through this vast ruin;
    Come take the lamp, and we'll explore together.

    _Josepha_ (_meeting them_). And I will with my son.

    _Ulric_.                          Nay--stay--dear mother!
    These chilly damps and the cold rush of winds
    Fling a rough paleness o'er thy delicate cheek--
    And thou seem'st lovely in thy sickliness
    Of most transparent beauty:--but it grieves me.
    Nay! tarry here by the blaze of the bright hearth:--
    I will return anon--and we have much                               240
    To listen and impart. Come, Carl, we'll find
    Some gorgeous canopy, and, thence, unroost
    It's present bedfellows the bats--and thou
    Shalt slumber underneath a velvet cloud
    That mantles o'er the couch of some dead Countess.
                                                 [_Exit_ CARL _and_ ULRIC.

    _Josepha_ (_sola_). It was my joy to see him--nothing more
    I should have said--which sent my gush of blood
    Back on my full heart with a dancing tide:
    It was my weary hope's unthought fulfilment,
    My agony of mother-feelings curdled                                250
    At once in gathered rapture--which did change
    My cheek into the hue of fainting Nature.
    I should have answered thus--and yet I could not:
    For though 'twas true--it was not all the truth.
    I have much suffered in the thought of Werner's
    Late deep distemperature of mind and fortunes,
    Which since have almost driven him into phrenzy:--
    And though that I would soothe, not share, such passions,
    And show not how they shake me:--when alone,
    I feel them prey upon me by reflection,                            260
    And want the very solace I bestowed;
    And which, it seems, I cannot give and have.
    Ulric must be my comforter--his father's
    Hath long been the most melancholy soul
    That ever hovered o'er the verge of Madness:
    And, better, had he leapt into it's gulph:
    Though to the Mad thoughts are realities,
    Yet they can play with sorrow--and live on.
    But with the mind of consciousness and care
    The body wears to ruin, and the struggle,                          270
    However long, is deadly----He is lost,
    And all around him tasteless:--in his mirth
    His very laughter moves me oft to tears,
    And I have turned to hide them--for, in him,
    As Sunshine glittering o'er unburied bones----
    Soft--he is here.----

    _Werner_.             Josepha--where is Ulric?

    _Josepha_. Gone with the other stranger to gaze o'er
    These shattered corridors, and spread themselves
    A pillow with their mantles, in the least ruinous:
    I must replenish the diminished hearth                             280
    In the inner chamber--the repast is ready,
    And Ulric will be here again.--





                       THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED:

                                 A DRAMA.




               INTRODUCTION TO _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.


The date of the original MS. of _The Deformed Transformed_ is "Pisa,
1822." There is nothing to show in what month it was written, but it may
be conjectured that it was begun and finished within the period which
elapsed between the death of Allegra, April 20, and the death of
Shelley, July 8, 1822. According to Medwin (_Conversations_, 1824, p.
227), an unfavourable criticism of Shelley's ("It is a bad imitation of
_Faust_"), together with a discovery that "two entire lines" of
Southey's--

    "And water shall see thee,
    And fear thee, and flee thee"--

were imbedded in one of his "Songs," touched Byron so deeply that he
"threw the poem into the fire," and concealed the existence of a second
copy for more than two years. It is a fact that Byron's correspondence
does not contain the remotest allusion to _The Deformed Transformed_;
but, with regard to the plagiarism from Southey, in the play as written
in 1822 there is neither Song nor Incantation which could have contained
two lines from _The Curse of Kehama_.

As a dramatist, Byron's function, or _metier_, was twofold. In
_Manfred_, in _Cain_, in _Heaven and Earth_, he is concerned with the
analysis and evolution of metaphysical or ethical notions; in _Marino
Faliero_, in _Sardanapalus_, and _The Two Foscari_, he set himself "to
dramatize striking passages of history;" in _The Deformed Transformed_
he sought to combine the solution of a metaphysical puzzle or problem,
the relation of personality to individuality, with the scenic rendering
of a striking historical episode, the Sack of Rome in 1527.

In the note or advertisement prefixed to the drama, Byron acknowledges
that "the production" is founded partly on the story of a forgotten
novel, _The Three Brothers_, and partly on "the _Faust_ of the great
Goethe."

Arnaud, or Julian, the hero of _The Three Brothers_ (by Joshua
Pickersgill, jun., 4 vols., 1803), "sells his soul to the Devil, and
becomes an arch-fiend in order to avenge himself for the taunts of
strangers on the deformity of his person" (see _Gent. Mag._, November,
1804, vol. 74, p. 1047; and _post_, pp. 473-479). The idea of an escape
from natural bonds or disabilities by supernatural means and at the
price of the soul or will, the _un_-Christlike surrender to the tempter,
which is the _grund-stoff_ of the Faust-legend, was brought home to
Byron, in the first instance, not by Goethe, or Calderon, or Marlowe,
but by Joshua Pickersgill. A fellow-feeling lent an intimate and
peculiar interest to the theme. He had suffered all his life from a
painful and inconvenient defect, which his proud and sensitive spirit
had magnified into a deformity. He had been stung to the quick by his
mother's taunts and his sweetheart's ridicule, by the jeers of the base
and thoughtless, by slanderous and brutal paragraphs in newspapers. He
could not forget that he was lame. If his enemies had but possessed the
wit, they might have given him "the sobriquet of _Le Diable Boiteux_"
(letter to Moore, April 2, 1823, _Letters_, 1901, vi. 179). It was no
wonder that so poignant, so persistent a calamity should be "reproduced
in his poetry" (_Life_, p. 13), or that his passionate impatience of
such a "thorn in the flesh" should picture to itself a mysterious and
unhallowed miracle of healing. It is true, as Moore says (_Life_, pp.
45, 306), that "the trifling deformity of his foot" was the embittering
circumstance of his life, that it "haunted him like a curse;" but it by
no means follows that he seriously regarded his physical peculiarity as
a stamp of the Divine reprobation, that "he was possessed by an _idee
fixe_ that every blessing would be 'turned into a curse' to him" (letter
of Lady Byron to H. C. Robinson, _Diary, etc._, 1869, in. 435, 436). No
doubt he indulged himself in morbid fancies, played with the
extravagances of a restless imagination, and wedded them to verse; but
his intellect, "brooding like the day, a master o'er a slave," kept
guard. He would never have pleaded on his own behalf that the tyranny of
an _idee fixe_, a delusion that he was predestined to evil, was an
excuse for his shortcomings or his sins.

Byron's very considerable obligations to _The Three Brothers_ might have
escaped notice, but the resemblance between his "Stranger," or "Caesar,"
and the Mephistopheles of "the great Goethe" was open and palpable.

If Medwin may be trusted (_Conversations_, 1824, p. 210), Byron had read
"_Faust_ in a sorry French translation," and it is probable that
Shelley's inspired rendering of "May-day Night," which was published in
_The Liberal_ (No. i., October 14, 1822, pp. 123-137), had been read to
him, and had attracted his attention. _The Deformed Transformed_ is "a
_Faustish_ kind of drama;" and Goethe, who maintained that Byron's play
as a whole was "no imitation," but "new and original, close, genuine,
and spirited," could not fail to perceive that "his devil was suggested
by my Mephistopheles" (_Conversations_, 1874, p. 174). The tempter who
cannot resist the temptation of sneering at his own wiles, who mocks for
mocking's sake, is not Byron's creation, but Goethe's. Lucifer talked
_at_ the clergy, if he did not "talk like a clergyman;" but the "bitter
hunchback," even when he is _solus_, sneers as the river wanders, "at
his own sweet will." He is not a doctor, but a spirit of unbelief!

The second part of _The Deformed Transformed_ represents, in three
scenes, the Siege and Sack of Rome in 1527. Byron had read Robertson's
_Charles the Fifth_ (ed. 1798, ii. 313-329) in his boyhood (_Life_, p.
47), but it is on record that he had studied, more or less closely, the
narratives of contemporary authorities. A note to _The Prophecy of
Dante_ (_Poetical Works_, 1901, iv. 258) refers to the _Sacco di Roma_,
descritto da Luigi Guicciardini, and the _Ragguaglio Storico ... sacco
di Roma dell' anno_ MDXXVII. of Jacopo Buonaparte; and it is evident
that he was familiar with Cellini's story of the marvellous gests and
exploits _quorum maxima pars fuit_, which were wrought at "the walls by
the Campo Santo," or on the ramparts of the Castle of San Angelo.

The Sack of Rome was a great national calamity, and it was something
more: it was a profanation and a sacrilege. The literature which it
evoked was a cry of anguish, a prophetic burden of despair. "Chants
populaires," writes M. Emile Gebhart (_De l'Italie_, "Le Sac de Rome en
1527," 1876, pp. 267, _sq._), "_Nouvelles_ de Giraldi Cintio, en forme
de Decameron ... recits historiques ... de Cesar Grollier, _Dialogues_
anonymes ... poesies de Pasquin, toute une litterature se developpa sur
ce theme douloureux.... Le _Lamento di Roma_, oeuvre etrange,
d'inspiration gibeline, rappelle les esperances politiques exprimees
jadis par Dante ... 'Bien que Cesar m'ait depouillee de liberte, nous
avons toujours ete d'accord dans une meme volonte. Je ne me lamenterais
pas si lui regnait; mais je crois qu'il est ressuscite, ou qu'il
ressuscitera veritablement, car souvent un Ange m'a annonce qu'un Cesar
viendrait me delivrer.'... Enfin, voici une chanson francaise que
repetaient en repassant les monts les soldats du Marquis de Saluces:--

    "Parlons de la deffaiete
    De ces pouvres Rommains,
    Aussi de la complainete
    De notre pere saint.

    "'O noble roy de France,
    Regarde en pitie
    L'Eglise en ballance ...
    Pour Dieu! ne tarde plus,
    C'est ta mere, ta substance;
    O fils, n'en faictz reffus.'"

"Le dernier monument," adds M. Gebhart, in a footnote, "de cette
litterature, est le singulier drame de Byron, _The Deformed
Transformed_, dont Jules Cesar est le heros, et le Sac de Rome le
cadre."

It is unlikely that Byron, who read everything he could lay his hands
upon, and spared no trouble to master his "period," had not, either at
first or second hand, acquainted himself with specimens of this popular
literature. (For _La Presa e Lamento di Roma_, _Romae Lamentatio_, etc.,
see _Lamenti Storici dei Secoli xiv., xv_. (Medin e Fratri), _Scelta di
Curiosita_, etc., 235, 236, 237, Bologna, 1890, vol. iii. See, too, for
"Chanson sur la Mort du Connetable de Bourbon," _Recueil de Chants
historiques francais_, par A. J. V. Le Roux de Lincy, 1842, ii. 99.)

_The Deformed Transformed_ was published by John Hunt, February 20,
1824. A third edition appeared February 23, 1824.

It was reviewed, unfavourably, in the _London Magazine_, March, 1824,
vol. 9, pp. 315-321; the _Scots Magazine_, March, 1824, N.S. vol. xiv.
pp. 353-356; and in the _Monthly Review_, March, 1824, Enlarged Series,
103, pp. 321, 324. One reviewer, however (_London Magazine_), had the
candour to admit that "Lord Byron may write below himself, but he can
never write below us!"

For the unfinished third part, _vide post_, pp. 532-534.

This production is founded partly on the story of a novel called "The
Three Brothers[201]," published many years ago, from which M. G. Lewis's
"Wood Demon"[202] was also taken; and partly on the "Faust" of the great
Goethe. The present publication[203] contains the two first Parts only,
and the opening chorus of the third. The rest may perhaps appear hereafter.

                      Arnold.

                      Bourbon.

                      Philibert.

                      Cellini.


                      Bertha.

                      Olimpia.

                     _Spirits, Soldiers, Citizens of Rome,
                     Priests, Peasants, etc._




                      THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED:[cv]


                                 PART I.


                          SCENE I.--_A Forest_.

                 _Enter_ ARNOLD _and his mother_ BERTHA.

    _Bert._ Out, Hunchback!

    _Arn._                 I was born so, Mother![204]

    _Bert._                                       Out,
    Thou incubus! Thou nightmare! Of seven sons,
    The sole abortion!

    _Arn._              Would that I had been so,
    And never seen the light!

    _Bert._                  I would so, too!
    But as thou _hast_--hence, hence--and do thy best!
    That back of thine may bear its burthen; 'tis
    More high, if not so broad as that of others.

    _Arn._ It _bears_ its burthen;--but, my heart! Will it
    Sustain that which you lay upon it, Mother?
    I love, or, at the least, I loved you: nothing                      10
    Save You, in nature, can love aught like me.
    You nursed me--do not kill me!

    _Bert._                      Yes--I nursed thee,
    Because thou wert my first-born, and I knew not
    If there would be another unlike thee,
    That monstrous sport of Nature. But get hence,
    And gather wood![205]

    _Arn._           I will: but when I bring it,
    Speak to me kindly. Though my brothers are
    So beautiful and lusty, and as free
    As the free chase they follow, do not spurn me:
    Our milk has been the same.

    _Bert._                    As is the hedgehog's,                    20
    Which sucks at midnight from the wholesome dam
    Of the young bull, until the milkmaid finds
    The nipple, next day, sore, and udder dry.
    Call not thy brothers brethren! Call me not
    Mother; for if I brought thee forth, it was
    As foolish hens at times hatch vipers, by
    Sitting upon strange eggs. Out, urchin, out!
                                                           [_Exit_ BERTHA.

    _Arn._ (_solus_). Oh, mother!--She is gone, and I must do
    Her bidding;--wearily but willingly
    I would fulfil it, could I only hope                                30
    A kind word in return. What shall I do?

                                [_ARNOLD begins to cut wood: in doing this
                                     he wounds one of his hands_.

    My labour for the day is over now.
    Accursed be this blood that flows so fast;
    For double curses will be my meed now
    At home--What home? I have no home, no kin,
    No kind--not made like other creatures, or
    To share their sports or pleasures. Must I bleed, too,
    Like them? Oh, that each drop which falls to earth
    Would rise a snake to sting them, as they have stung me!
    Or that the Devil, to whom they liken me,                           40
    Would aid his likeness! If I must partake[206]
    His form, why not his power? Is it because
    I have not his will too? For one kind word
    From her who bore me would still reconcile me
    Even to this hateful aspect. Let me wash
    The wound.

                             [ARNOLD _goes to a spring, and stoops to wash
                                     his hand: he starts back_.

    They are right; and Nature's mirror shows me,
    What she hath made me. I will not look on it
    Again, and scarce dare think on't. Hideous wretch
    That I am! The very waters mock me with                             50
    My horrid shadow--like a demon placed
    Deep in the fountain to scare back the cattle
    From drinking therein.                                   [_He pauses_.
                           And shall I live on,
    A burden to the earth, myself, and shame
    Unto what brought me into life? Thou blood,
    Which flowest so freely from a scratch, let me
    Try if thou wilt not, in a fuller stream,
    Pour forth my woes for ever with thyself
    On earth, to which I will restore, at once,
    This hateful compound of her atoms, and                             60
    Resolve back to her elements, and take
    The shape of any reptile save myself,
    And make a world for myriads of new worms!
    This knife! now let me prove if it will sever
    This withered slip of Nature's nightshade--my
    Vile form--from the creation, as it hath
    The green bough from the forest.

                             [ARNOLD _places the knife in the ground, with
                                    the point upwards_.

                                    Now 'tis set,
    And I can fall upon it. Yet one glance
    On the fair day, which sees no foul thing like
    Myself, and the sweet sun which warmed me, but                      70
    In vain. The birds--how joyously they sing!
    So let them, for I would not be lamented:
    But let their merriest notes be Arnold's knell;
    The fallen leaves my monument; the murmur
    Of the near fountain my sole elegy.
    Now, knife, stand firmly, as I fain would fall!

                           [_As he rushes to throw himself upon the knife,
                               his eye is suddenly caught by the fountain,
                               which seems in motion_.

    The fountain moves without a wind: but shall
    The ripple of a spring change my resolve?
    No. Yet it moves again! The waters stir,
    Not as with air, but by some subterrane                             80
    And rocking Power of the internal world.
    What's here? A mist! No more?--

                       [_A cloud comes from the fountain. He stands gazing
                             upon it: it is dispelled, and a tall black
                             man comes towards him_.[207]

    _Arn._                           What would you? Speak!
    Spirit or man?

    _Stran._       As man is both, why not
    Say both in one?

    _Arn._          Your form is man's, and yet
    You may be devil.

    _Stran._         So many men are that
    Which is so called or thought, that you may add me
    To which you please, without much wrong to either.
    But come: you wish to kill yourself;--pursue
    Your purpose.

    _Arn._       You have interrupted me.

    _Stran._ What is that resolution which can e'er                     90
    Be interrupted? If I be the devil
    You deem, a single moment would have made you
    Mine, and for ever, by your suicide;
    And yet my coming saves you.

    _Arn._                       I said not
    You _were_ the Demon, but that your approach
    Was like one.

    _Stran._      Unless you keep company
    With him (and you seem scarce used to such high
    Society) you can't tell how he approaches;
    And for his aspect, look upon the fountain,
    And then on me, and judge which of us twain                        100
    Looks likest what the boors believe to be
    Their cloven-footed terror.

    _Arn._                      Do you--dare _you_
    To taunt me with my born deformity?

    _Stran._ Were I to taunt a buffalo with this
    Cloven foot of thine, or the swift dromedary
    With thy Sublime of Humps, the animals
    Would revel in the compliment. And yet
    Both beings are more swift, more strong, more mighty
    In action and endurance than thyself,
    And all the fierce and fair of the same kind                       110
    With thee. Thy form is natural: 'twas only
    Nature's mistaken largess to bestow
    The gifts which are of others upon man.

    _Arn._ Give me the strength then of the buffalo's foot,[cw]
    When he spurns high the dust, beholding his
    Near enemy; or let me have the long
    And patient swiftness of the desert-ship,
    The helmless dromedary!--and I'll bear[cx]
    Thy fiendish sarcasm with a saintly patience.

    _Stran._ I will.

    _Arn._ (_with surprise_). Thou _canst?_

    _Stran._                          Perhaps. Would you aught else?   120

    _Arn._ Thou mockest me.

    _Stran._                Not I. Why should I mock
    What all are mocking? That's poor sport, methinks.
    To talk to thee in human language (for
    Thou canst not yet speak mine), the forester
    Hunts not the wretched coney, but the boar,
    Or wolf, or lion--leaving paltry game
    To petty burghers, who leave once a year
    Their walls, to fill their household cauldrons with
    Such scullion prey. The meanest gibe at thee,--
    Now _I_ can mock the mightiest.[cy]

    _Arn._                           Then waste not                    130
    Thy time on me: I seek thee not.

    _Stran._                         Your thoughts
    Are not far from me. Do not send me back:
    I'm not so easily recalled to do
    Good service.

    _Arn._        What wilt thou do for me?

    _Stran._                               Change
    Shapes with you, if you will, since yours so irks you;
    Or form you to your wish in any shape.

    _Arn._ Oh! then you are indeed the Demon, for
    Nought else would wittingly wear mine.

    _Stran._                               I'll show thee
    The brightest which the world e'er bore, and give thee
    Thy choice.

    _Arn._       On what condition?

    _Stran._                       There's a question!                 140
    An hour ago you would have given your soul
    To look like other men, and now you pause
    To wear the form of heroes.

    _Arn._                     No; I will not.
    I must not compromise my soul.

    _Stran._                       What soul,
    Worth naming so, would dwell in such a carcase?

    _Arn._ 'Tis an aspiring one, whate'er the tenement
    In which it is mislodged. But name your compact:
    Must it be signed in blood?

    _Stran._                   Not in your own.

    _Arn._ Whose blood then?

    _Stran._                 We will talk of that hereafter.
    But I'll be moderate with you, for I see                           150
    Great things within you. You shall have no bond
    But your own will, no contract save your deeds.
    Are you content?

    _Arn._           I take thee at thy word.

    _Stran._   Now then!--
             [_The Stranger approaches the fountain, and turns to_ ARNOLD.

                          A little of your blood.[208]

    _Arn._                                        For what?

    _Stran._ To mingle with the magic of the waters,
    And make the charm effective.

    _Arn._ (_holding out his wounded arm_). Take it all.

    _Stran._ Not now. A few drops will suffice for this.

                      [_The Stranger takes some of_ ARNOLD'S _blood in his
                             hand, and casts it into the fountain_.

    Shadows of Beauty!
      Shadows of Power!
    Rise to your duty--                                                160
      This is the hour!
    Walk lovely and pliant[cz]
      From the depth of this fountain,
    As the cloud-shapen giant
      Bestrides the Hartz Mountain.[209]
    Come as ye were,
      That our eyes may behold
    The model in air
      Of the form I will mould,
    Bright as the Iris                                                 170
      When ether is spanned;--
    Such _his_ desire is,                           [_Pointing to_ ARNOLD.
      Such _my_ command![da]
    Demons heroic--
      Demons who wore
    The form of the Stoic
      Or sophist of yore--
    Or the shape of each victor--
      From Macedon's boy,
    To each high Roman's picture,                                      180
      Who breathed to destroy--
    Shadows of Beauty!
      Shadows of Power!
    Up to your duty--
      This is the hour!

                        [_Various phantoms arise from the waters, and pass
                            in succession before the Stranger and_ ARNOLD.

    _Arn._ What do I see?

    _Stran._              The black-eyed Roman,[210] with
    The eagle's beak between those eyes which ne'er
    Beheld a conqueror, or looked along
    The land he made not Rome's, while Rome became
    His, and all theirs who heired his very name.                      190

    _Arn._ The phantom's bald; _my_ quest is beauty. Could I
    Inherit but his fame with his defects!

    _Stran._ His brow was girt with laurels more than hairs.[211]
    You see his aspect--choose it, or reject.
    I can but promise you his form; his fame
    Must be long sought and fought for.

    _Arn._                              I will fight, too,
    But not as a mock Caesar. Let him pass:
    His aspect may be fair, but suits me not.

    _Stran._ Then you are far more difficult to please
    Than Cato's sister, or than Brutus's mother,                       200
    Or Cleopatra at sixteen[212]--an age
    When love is not less in the eye than heart.
    But be it so! Shadow, pass on!
                                [_The phantom of Julius Caesar disappears_.

    _Arn._                          And can it
    Be, that the man who shook the earth is gone,[db]
    And left no footstep?

    _Stran._             There you err. His substance
    Left graves enough, and woes enough, and fame
    More than enough to track his memory;
    But for his shadow--'tis no more than yours,
    Except a little longer and less crooked
    I' the sun. Behold another!                [_A second phantom passes_.

    _Arn._                     Who is he?                              210

    _Stran._ He was the fairest and the bravest of
    Athenians.[213] Look upon him well.

    _Arn._                             He is
    More lovely than the last. How beautiful!

    _Stran._ Such was the curled son of Clinias;--wouldst thou
    Invest thee with his form?

    _Arn._                     Would that I had
    Been born with it! But since I may choose further,
    I will _look_ further.          [_The shade of Alcibiades disappears_.

    _Stran._              Lo! behold again!

    _Arn._ What! that low, swarthy, short-nosed, round-eyed satyr,
    With the wide nostrils and Silenus' aspect,
    The splay feet and low stature![214] I had better                  220
    Remain that which I am.

    _Stran._               And yet he was
    The earth's perfection of all mental beauty,
    And personification of all virtue.
    But you reject him?

    _Arn._             If his form could bring me
    That which redeemed it--no.

    _Stran._                     I have no power
    To promise that; but you may try, and find it
    Easier in such a form--or in your own.

    _Arn._ No. I was not born for philosophy,
    Though I have that about me which has need on't.
    Let him fleet on.

    _Stran._          Be air, thou Hemlock-drinker!                    230
                      [_The shadow of Socrates disappears: another rises_.

    _Arn._ What's here? whose broad brow and whose curly beard
    And manly aspect look like Hercules,[215]
    Save that his jocund eye hath more of Bacchus
    Than the sad purger of the infernal world,
    Leaning dejected on his club of conquest,[216]
    As if he knew the worthlessness of those
    For whom he had fought.

    _Stran._                It was the man who lost
    The ancient world for love.

    _Arn._                      I cannot blame him,
    Since I have risked my soul because I find not
    That which he exchanged the earth for.

    _Stran._                              Since so far                 240
    You seem congenial, will you wear his features?

    _Arn._ No. As you leave me choice, I am difficult.
    If but to see the heroes I should ne'er
    Have seen else, on this side of the dim shore,
    Whence they float back before us.

    _Stran._                         Hence, Triumvir,
    Thy Cleopatra's waiting.
                         [_The shade of Antony disappears: another rises_.

    _Arn._                  Who is this?
    Who truly looketh like a demigod,
    Blooming and bright, with golden hair, and stature,
    If not more high than mortal, yet immortal
    In all that nameless bearing of his limbs,                         250
    Which he wears as the Sun his rays--a something
    Which shines from him, and yet is but the flashing
    Emanation of a thing more glorious still.
    Was _he e'er human only?_[217]

    _Stran._                   Let the earth speak,
    If there be atoms of him left, or even
    Of the more solid gold that formed his urn.

    _Arn._ Who was this glory of mankind?

    _Stran._                              The shame
    Of Greece in peace, her thunderbolt in war--
    Demetrius the Macedonian, and
    Taker of cities.

    _Arn._           Yet one shadow more.                              260

    _Stran._ (_addressing the shadow_). Get thee to Lamia's lap!
            [_The shade of Demetrius Poliorcetes vanishes: another rises_.
                                      I'll fit you still,
    Fear not, my Hunchback: if the shadows of
    That which existed please not your nice taste,
    I'll animate the ideal marble, till
    Your soul be reconciled to her new garment

    _Arn._ Content! I will fix here.

    _Stran._                         I must commend
    Your choice. The godlike son of the sea-goddess,
    The unshorn boy of Peleus, with his locks
    As beautiful and clear as the amber waves
    Of rich Pactolus, rolled o'er sands of gold,                       270
    Softened by intervening crystal, and
    Rippled like flowing waters by the wind,
    All vowed to Sperchius[218] as they were--behold them!
    And _him_--as he stood by Polixena,
    With sanctioned and with softened love, before
    The altar, gazing on his Trojan bride,
    With some remorse within for Hector slain
    And Priam weeping, mingled with deep passion
    For the sweet downcast virgin, whose young hand
    Trembled in _his_ who slew her brother. So                         280
    He stood i' the temple! Look upon him as
    Greece looked her last upon her best, the instant
    Ere Paris' arrow flew.

    _Arn._                I gaze upon him
    As if I were his soul, whose form shall soon
    Envelope mine.

    _Stran._       You have done well. The greatest
    Deformity should only barter with
    The extremest beauty--if the proverb's true
    Of mortals, that Extremes meet.

    _Arn._                          Come! Be quick!
    I am impatient.

    _Stran._        As a youthful beauty
    Before her glass. _You both_ see what is not,                      290
    But dream it is what must be.

    _Arn._                        Must I wait?

    _Stran._ No; that were a pity. But a word or two:
    His stature is twelve cubits; would you so far
    Outstep these times, and be a Titan? Or
    (To talk canonically) wax a son
    Of Anak?

    _Arn._ Why not?

    _Stran._        Glorious ambition!
    I love thee most in dwarfs! A mortal of
    Philistine stature would have gladly pared
    His own Goliath down to a slight David:
    But thou, my manikin, wouldst soar a show                          300
    Rather than hero. Thou shalt be indulged,
    If such be thy desire; and, yet, by being
    A little less removed from present men
    In figure, thou canst sway them more; for all
    Would rise against thee now, as if to hunt
    A new-found Mammoth; and their cursed engines,
    Their culverins, and so forth, would find way
    Through our friend's armour there, with greater ease
    Than the Adulterer's arrow through his heel
    Which Thetis had forgotten to baptize                              310
    In Styx.

    _Arn._  Then let it be as thou deem'st best.

    _Stran._ Thou shalt be beauteous as the thing thou seest,
    And strong as what it was, and----

    _Arn._                          I ask not
    For Valour, since Deformity is daring.[219]
    It is its essence to o'ertake mankind
    By heart and soul, and make itself the equal--
    Aye, the superior of the rest. There is
    A spur in its halt movements, to become
    All that the others cannot, in such things
    As still are free to both, to compensate                           320
    For stepdame Nature's avarice at first.
    They woo with fearless deeds the smiles of fortune,
    And oft, like Timour the lame Tartar,[220] win them.

    _Stran._ Well spoken! And thou doubtless wilt remain
    Formed as thou art. I may dismiss the mould
    Of shadow, which must turn to flesh, to incase
    This daring soul, which could achieve no less
    Without it.

    _Arn._      Had no power presented me
    The possibility of change, I would
    Have done the best which spirit may to make                        330
    Its way with all Deformity's dull, deadly,
    Discouraging weight upon me, like a mountain,
    In feeling, on my heart as on my shoulders--
    A hateful and unsightly molehill to
    The eyes of happier men. I would have looked
    On Beauty in that sex which is the type
    Of all we know or dream of beautiful,
    Beyond the world they brighten, with a sigh--
    Not of love, but despair; nor sought to win,
    Though to a heart all love, what could not love me                 340
    In turn, because of this vile crooked clog,
    Which makes me lonely. Nay, I could have borne
    It all, had not my mother spurned me from her.
    The she-bear licks her cubs into a sort
    Of shape;--my Dam beheld my shape was hopeless.
    Had she exposed me, like the Spartan, ere
    I knew the passionate part of life, I had
    Been a clod of the valley,--happier nothing
    Than what I am. But even thus--the lowest,
    Ugliest, and meanest of mankind--what courage                      350
    And perseverance could have done, perchance
    Had made me something--as it has made heroes
    Of the same mould as mine. You lately saw me
    Master of my own life, and quick to quit it;
    And he who is so is the master of
    Whatever dreads to die.

    _Stran._               Decide between
    What you have been, or will be.

    _Arn._                         I have done so.
    You have opened brighter prospects to my eyes,
    And sweeter to my heart. As I am now,
    I might be feared--admired--respected--loved                       360
    Of all save those next to me, of whom I
    Would be beloved. As thou showest me
    A choice of forms, I take the one I view.
    Haste! haste!

    _Stran._      And what shall _I_ wear?

    _Arn._                                 Surely, he
    Who can command all forms will choose the highest,
    Something superior even to that which was
    Pelides now before us. Perhaps _his_
    Who slew him, that of Paris: or--still higher--
    The Poet's God, clothed in such limbs as are
    Themselves a poetry.

    _Stran._            Less will content me;                          370
    For I, too, love a change.

    _Arn._                    Your aspect is
    Dusky, but not uncomely.[221]

    _Stran._                  If I chose,
    I might be whiter; but I have a _penchant_
    For black--it is so honest, and, besides,
    Can neither blush with shame nor pale with fear;
    But I have worn it long enough of late,
    And now I'll take your figure.

    _Arn._                         Mine!

    _Stran._                            Yes. You
    Shall change with Thetis' son, and I with Bertha,
    Your mother's offspring. People have their tastes;
    You have yours--I mine.

    _Arn._                  Despatch! despatch!

    _Stran._                                  Even so.                 380

                             [_The Stranger takes some earth and moulds it
                                  along the turf, and then addresses
                                  the phantom of Achilles_.

    Beautiful shadow
      Of Thetis's boy!
    Who sleeps in the meadow
      Whose grass grows o'er Troy:
    From the red earth, like Adam,[222]
      Thy likeness I shape,
    As the Being who made him,
      Whose actions I ape.
    Thou Clay, be all glowing,
      Till the Rose in his cheek                                       390
    Be as fair as, when blowing,
      It wears its first streak!
    Ye Violets, I scatter,
      Now turn into eyes!
    And thou, sunshiny Water,
      Of blood take the guise!
    Let these Hyacinth boughs
      Be his long flowing hair,
    And wave o'er his brows,
      As thou wavest in air!                                           400
    Let his heart be this marble
      I tear from the rock!
    But his voice as the warble
      Of birds on yon oak!
    Let his flesh be the purest
      Of mould, in which grew
    The Lily-root surest,
      And drank the best dew!
    Let his limbs be the lightest
      Which clay can compound,                                         410
    And his aspect the brightest
      On earth to be found!
    Elements, near me,
      Be mingled and stirred,
    Know me, and hear me,
      And leap to my word!
    Sunbeams, awaken
      This earth's animation![dc]
    'Tis done! He hath taken
      His stand in creation!                                           420

                  [ARNOLD _falls senseless; his soul passes into the shape
                         of Achilles, which rises from the ground; while
                         the phantom has disappeared, part by part,
                         as the figure was formed from the earth_.

    _Arn._ (_in his new form_). I love, and I shall be beloved! Oh, life!
    At last I feel thee! Glorious Spirit!

    _Stran._                             Stop!
    What shall become of your abandoned garment,
    Yon hump, and lump, and clod of ugliness,
    Which late you wore, or were?

    _Arn._                       Who cares? Let wolves
    And vultures take it, if they will.

    _Stran._                            And if
    They do, and are not scared by it, you'll say
    It must be peace-time, and no better fare
    Abroad i' the fields.

    _Arn._               Let us but leave it there;
    No matter what becomes on't.

    _Stran._                    That's ungracious;                     430
    If not ungrateful. Whatsoe'er it be,
    It hath sustained your soul full many a day.

    _Arn._ Aye, as the dunghill may conceal a gem
    Which is now set in gold, as jewels should be.

    _Stran._ But if I give another form, it must be
    By fair exchange, not robbery. For they[223]
    Who make men without women's aid have long
    Had patents for the same, and do not love
    Your Interlopers. The Devil may take men,[dd]
    Not make them,--though he reap the benefit                         440
    Of the original workmanship:--and therefore
    Some one must be found to assume the shape
    You have quitted.

    _Arn._            Who would do so?

    _Stran._                         That I know not,
    And therefore I must.

    _Arn._                You!

    _Stran._                  I said it ere
    You inhabited your present dome of beauty.

    _Arn._ True. I forget all things in the new joy
    Of this immortal change.

    _Stran._                In a few moments
    I will be as you were, and you shall see
    Yourself for ever by you, as your shadow.

    _Arn._ I would be spared this.

    _Stran._                       But it cannot be.                   450
    What! shrink already, being what you are,
    From seeing what you were?

    _Arn._                    Do as thou wilt.

    _Stran._ (_to the late form of_ ARNOLD, _extended on the earth_).
          Clay! not dead, but soul-less!
            Though no man would choose thee,
          An Immortal no less
            Deigns not to refuse thee.
          Clay thou art; and unto spirit
          All clay is of equal merit.
          Fire! _without_ which nought can live;
          Fire! but _in_ which nought can live,                        460
            Save the fabled salamander,
            Or immortal souls, which wander,
          Praying what doth not forgive,
          Howling for a drop of water,
              Burning in a quenchless lot:
          Fire! the only element
            Where nor fish, beast, bird, nor worm,
              Save the Worm which dieth not,
            Can preserve a moment's form,
          But must with thyself be blent:                              470
          Fire! man's safeguard and his slaughter:
          Fire! Creation's first-born Daughter,
            And Destruction's threatened Son,
            When Heaven with the world hath done:
          Fire! assist me to renew
          Life in what lies in my view
            Stiff and cold!
          His resurrection rests with me and you!
          One little, marshy spark of flame--[224]
          And he again shall seem the same;                            480
            But I his Spirit's place shall hold!

                        [_An ignis-fatuus flits through the wood and rests
                             on the brow of the body. The Stranger
                             disappears: the body rises_.

    _Arn._ (_in his new form_). Oh! horrible!

    _Stran._ (_in_ ARNOLD'S _late shape_). What! tremblest thou?

    _Arn._                                   Not so--
    I merely shudder. Where is fled the shape
    Thou lately worest?

    _Stran._           To the world of shadows.
    But let us thread the present. Whither wilt thou?

    _Arn._ Must thou be my companion?

    _Stran._                          Wherefore not?
    Your betters keep worse company.

    _Arn._                          _My_ betters!

    _Stran._ Oh! you wax proud, I see, of your new form:
    I'm glad of that. Ungrateful too! That's well;
    You improve apace;--two changes in an instant,                     490
    And you are old in the World's ways already.
    But bear with me: indeed you'll find me useful
    Upon your pilgrimage. But come, pronounce
    Where shall we now be errant?

    _Arn._                       Where the World
    Is thickest, that I may behold it in
    Its workings.

    _Stran._     That's to say, where there is War
    And Woman in activity. Let's see!
    Spain--Italy--the new Atlantic world[225]--
    Afric with all its Moors. In very truth,
    There is small choice: the whole race are just now                 500
    Tugging as usual at each other's hearts.

    _Arn._ I have heard great things of Rome.

    _Stran._                                  A goodly choice--
    And scarce a better to be found on earth,
    Since Sodom was put out. The field is wide too;
    For now the Frank, and Hun, and Spanish scion
    Of the old Vandals, are at play along
    The sunny shores of the World's garden.

    _Arn._                                 How
    Shall we proceed?

    _Stran._         Like gallants, on good coursers.
    What, ho! my chargers! Never yet were better,
    Since Phaeton was upset into the Po[226].                          510
    Our pages too!

             _Enter two Pages, with four coal-black horses_.

    _Arn._          A noble sight!

    _Stran._                      And of
    A nobler breed. Match me in Barbary,
    Or your Kochlini race of Araby[de][227],
    With these!

    _Arn._     The mighty steam, which volumes high
    From their proud nostrils, burns the very air;
    And sparks of flame, like dancing fire-flies wheel
    Around their manes, as common insects swarm
    Round common steeds towards sunset.

    _Stran._                           Mount, my lord:
    They and I are your servitors.

    _Arn._                        And these
    Our dark-eyed pages--what may be their names?                      520

    _Stran._ You shall baptize them.

    _Arn._                           What! in holy water?

    _Stran._ Why not? The deeper sinner, better saint.

    _Arn._ They are beautiful, and cannot, sure, be demons.

    _Stran._ True; the devil's always ugly: and your beauty
    Is never diabolical.

    _Arn._               I'll call him
    Who bears the golden horn, and wears such bright
    And blooming aspect, _Huon_;[228] for he looks
    Like to the lovely boy lost in the forest,
    And never found till now. And for the other
    And darker, and more thoughtful, who smiles not,                   530
    But looks as serious though serene as night,
    He shall be _Memnon_[229], from the Ethiop king
    Whose statue turns a harper once a day.
    And you?

    _Stran._ I have ten thousand names, and twice
    As many attributes; but as I wear
    A human shape, will take a human name.

    _Arn._ More human than the shape (though it was mine once)
    I trust.

    _Stran._ Then call me Caesar.

    _Arn._                       Why, that name
    Belongs to Empire, and has been but borne
    By the World's lords.

    _Stran._             And therefore fittest for                     540
    The Devil in disguise--since so you deem me,
    Unless you call me Pope instead.

    _Arn._                           Well, then,
    Caesar thou shalt be. For myself, my name
    Shall be plain Arnold still.

    _Caes._                      We'll add a title[df]--
    "Count Arnold:" it hath no ungracious sound,
    And will look well upon a billet-doux.

    _Arn._ Or in an order for a battle-field.

    _Caes._ (_sings_).
        To horse! to horse! my coal-black steed
          Paws the ground and snuffs the air!
        There's not a foal of Arab's breed                             550
          More knows whom he must bear;
          On the hill he will not tire,
          Swifter as it waxes higher;
          In the marsh he will not slacken,
          On the plain be overtaken;
          In the wave he will not sink,
          Nor pause at the brook's side to drink;
          In the race he will not pant,
          In the combat he'll not faint;
          On the stones he will not stumble,                           560
          Time nor toil shall make him humble;
          In the stall he will not stiffen,
          But be winged as a Griffin,
          Only flying with his feet:
          And will not such a voyage be sweet?
          Merrily! merrily! never unsound,
          Shall our bonny black horses skim over the ground!
        From the Alps to the Caucasus, ride we, or fly!
        For we'll leave them behind in the glance of an eye.
                                [_They mount their horses, and disappear_.


              SCENE II.--_A Camp before the walls of Rome_.

                           ARNOLD _and_ CAESAR.

    _Caes._ You are well entered now.

    _Arn._                           Aye; but my path
    Has been o'er carcasses: mine eyes are full[dg]
    Of blood.

    _Caes._    Then wipe them, and see clearly. Why!
    Thou art a conqueror; the chosen knight
    And free companion of the gallant Bourbon,
    Late constable of France[230]; and now to be
    Lord of the city which hath been Earth's Lord
    Under its emperors, and--changing sex,
    Not sceptre, an Hermaphrodite of Empire--
    _Lady_ of the old world[231].

    _Arn._                       How _old?_ What! are there             10
    _New_ worlds?

    _Caes._       To _you_. You'll find there are such shortly,
    By its rich harvests, new disease, and gold;
    From one _half_ of the world named a _whole_ new one,
    Because you know no better than the dull
    And dubious notice of your eyes and ears.

    _Arn._ I'll trust them.

    _Caes._                  Do! They will deceive you sweetly,
    And that is better than the bitter truth.

    _Arn._ Dog!

    _Caes._       Man!

    _Arn._            Devil!

    _Caes._                  Your obedient humble servant.

    _Arn._ Say _master_ rather. Thou hast lured me on,
    Through scenes of blood and lust, till I am here.                   20

    _Caes._ And where wouldst thou be?

    _Arn._                           Oh, _at_ peace--_in_ peace!

    _Caes._ And where is that which is so? From the star
    To the winding worm, all life is motion; and
    In life _commotion_ is the extremest point
    Of life. The planet wheels till it becomes
    A comet, and destroying as it sweeps
    The stars, goes out. The poor worm winds its way,
    Living upon the death of other things,
    But still, like them, must live and die, the subject
    Of something which has made it live and die.                        30
    You must obey what all obey, the rule
    Of fixed Necessity: against her edict
    Rebellion prospers not.

    _Arn._                  And when it prospers----

    _Caes._ 'Tis no rebellion.

    _Arn._                     Will it prosper now?

    _Caes._ The Bourbon hath given orders for the assault,
    And by the dawn there will be work.

    _Arn._                              Alas!
    And shall the city yield? I see the giant
    Abode of the true God, and his true saint,
    Saint Peter, rear its dome and cross into
    That sky whence Christ ascended from the cross,                     40
    Which his blood made a badge of glory and
    Of joy (as once of torture unto him),--
    God and God's Son, man's sole and only refuge!

    _Caes._ 'Tis there, and shall be.

    _Arn._                            What?

    _Caes._                                The Crucifix
    Above, and many altar shrines below.
    Also some culverins upon the walls,
    And harquebusses, and what not; besides
    The men who are to kindle them to death
    Of other men.

    _Arn._        And those scarce mortal arches,[232]
    Pile above pile of everlasting wall,                                50
    The theatre where Emperors and their subjects
    (Those subjects _Romans_) stood at gaze upon
    The battles of the monarchs of the wild
    And wood--the lion and his tusky rebels
    Of the then untamed desert, brought to joust
    In the arena--as right well they might,
    When they had left no human foe unconquered--
    Made even the forest pay its tribute of
    Life to their amphitheatre, as well
    As Dacia men to die the eternal death                               60
    For a sole instant's pastime, and "Pass on
    To a new gladiator!"--Must it fall?

    _Caes._ The city, or the amphitheatre?
    The church, or one, or all? for you confound
    Both them and me.

    _Arn._            To-morrow sounds the assault
    With the first cock-crow.

    _Caes._                   Which, if it end with
    The evening's first nightingale, will be
    Something new in the annals of great sieges;
    For men must have their prey after long toil.

    _Arn._ The sun goes down as calmly, and perhaps                     70
    More beautifully, than he did on Rome
    On the day Remus leapt her wall.

    _Caes._                          I saw him.

    _Arn._ You!

    _Caes._      Yes, Sir! You forget I am or was
    Spirit, till I took up with your cast shape,
    And a worse name. I'm Caesar and a hunch-back
    Now. Well! the first of Caesars was a bald-head,
    And loved his laurels better as a wig
    (So history says) than as a glory.[233] Thus
    The world runs on, but we'll be merry still.
    I saw your Romulus (simple as I am)                                 80
    Slay his own twin, quick-born of the same womb,
    Because he leapt a ditch ('twas then no wall,
    Whate'er it now be); and Rome's earliest cement
    Was brother's blood; and if its native blood
    Be spilt till the choked Tiber be as red
    As e'er 'twas yellow, it will never wear
    The deep hue of the Ocean and the Earth,
    Which the great robber sons of fratricide
    Have made their never-ceasing scene of slaughter,
    For ages.

    _Arn._    But what have these done, their far                       90
    Remote descendants, who have lived in peace,
    The peace of Heaven, and in her sunshine of
    Piety?

    _Caes._ And what had _they_ done, whom the old
    Romans o'erswept?--Hark!

    _Arn._                   They are soldiers singing
    A reckless roundelay, upon the eve
    Of many deaths, it may be of their own.

    _Caes._ And why should they not sing as well as swans?
    They are black ones, to be sure.

    _Arn._                          So, you are learned,
    I see, too?

    _Caes._     In my grammar, certes. I
    Was educated for a monk of all times,                              100
    And once I was well versed in the forgotten
    Etruscan letters, and--were I so minded--
    Could make their hieroglyphics plainer than
    Your alphabet.

    _Arn._         And wherefore do you not?

    _Caes._ It answers better to resolve the alphabet
    Back into hieroglyphics. Like your statesman,
    And prophet, pontiff, doctor, alchymist,
    Philosopher, and what not, they have built
    More Babels, without new dispersion, than
    The stammering young ones of the flood's dull ooze,                110
    Who failed and fled each other. Why? why, marry,
    Because no man could understand his neighbour.
    They are wiser now, and will not separate
    For nonsense. Nay, it is their brotherhood,
    Their Shibboleth--their Koran--Talmud--their
    Cabala--their best brick-work, wherewithal
    They build more----

    _Arn._ (_interrupting him_). Oh, thou everlasting sneerer!
    Be silent! How the soldier's rough strain seems
    Softened by distance to a hymn-like cadence!
    Listen!

    _Caes._ Yes. I have heard the angels sing.                          120

    _Arn._ And demons howl.

    _Caes._                 And man, too. Let us listen:
    I love all music.

                     _Song of the Soldiers within_.

                The black bands came over
                  The Alps and their snow;
                With Bourbon, the rover,
                  They passed the broad Po.
                We have beaten all foemen,
                  We have captured a King[234],
                We have turned back on no men,
                  And so let us sing!                                  130
                Here's the Bourbon for ever!
                  Though penniless all,
                We'll have one more endeavour
                  At yonder old wall.
                With the Bourbon we'll gather
                  At day-dawn before
                The gates, and together
                  Or break or climb o'er
                The wall: on the ladder,
                  As mounts each firm foot[dh],                        140
                Our shout shall grow gladder,
                  And Death only be mute[235].
                With the Bourbon we'll mount o'er
                  The walls of old Rome,
                And who then shall count o'er[di]
                  The spoils of each dome?
                Up! up with the Lily!
                  And down with the Keys!
                In old Rome, the seven-hilly,
                  We'll revel at ease.                                 150
                Her streets shall be gory,
                  Her Tiber all red,
                And her temples so hoary
                  Shall clang with our tread.
                Oh, the Bourbon! the Bourbon[236]!
                  The Bourbon for aye!
                Of our song bear the burden!
                  And fire, fire away!
                With Spain for the vanguard,
                  Our varied host comes;                               160
                And next to the Spaniard
                  Beat Germany's drums;
                And Italy's lances
                  Are couched at their mother;
                But our leader from France is,
                  Who warred with his brother.
                Oh, the Bourbon! the Bourbon!
                  Sans country or home,
                We'll follow the Bourbon,
                  To plunder old Rome.                                 170

    _Caes._           An indifferent song
    For those within the walls, methinks, to hear.

    _Arn._ Yes, if they keep to their chorus. But here comes
    The general with his chiefs and men of trust[dj].
    A goodly rebel.

          _Enter the Constable_ BOURBON _"cum suis," etc., etc._

    _Phil._          How now, noble Prince,
    You are not cheerful?

    _Bourb._             Why should I be so?

    _Phil._ Upon the eve of conquest, such as ours,
    Most men would be so.

    _Bourb._               If I were secure!

    _Phil._ Doubt not our soldiers. Were the walls of adamant,
    They'd crack them. Hunger is a sharp artillery.                    180

    _Bourb._ That they will falter is my least of fears.
    That they will be repulsed, with Bourbon for
    Their chief, and all their kindled appetites
    To marshal them on--were those hoary walls
    Mountains, and those who guard them like the gods
    Of the old fables, I would trust my Titans;--
    But now----

    _Phil._    They are but men who war with mortals.

    _Bourb._ True: but those walls have girded in great ages,
    And sent forth mighty spirits. The past earth
    And present phantom of imperious Rome[dk]                          190
    Is peopled with those warriors; and methinks
    They flit along the eternal City's rampart,
    And stretch their glorious, gory, shadowy hands,
    And beckon me away!

    _Phil._            So let them! Wilt thou
    Turn back from shadowy menaces of shadows?

    _Bourb._ They do not menace me. I could have faced,
    Methinks, a Sylla's menace; but they clasp,
    And raise, and wring their dim and deathlike hands,
    And with their thin aspen faces and fixed eyes
    Fascinate mine. Look there!

    _Phil._                    I look upon                             200
    A lofty battlement.

    _Bourb._            And there!

    _Phil._                       Not even
    A guard in sight; they wisely keep below,
    Sheltered by the grey parapet from some
    Stray bullet of our lansquenets, who might
    Practise in the cool twilight.

    _Bourb._                      You are blind.

    _Phil._ If seeing nothing more than may be seen
    Be so.

    _Bourb._ A thousand years have manned the walls
    With all their heroes,--the last Cato[237] stands
    And tears his bowels, rather than survive
    The liberty of that I would enslave.                               210
    And the first Cassar with his triumphs flits
    From battlement to battlement.

    _Phil._                        Then conquer
    The walls for which he conquered and be greater!

    _Bourb._ True: so I will, or perish.

    _Phil._                              You can _not_.
    In such an enterprise to die is rather
    The dawn of an eternal day, than death.
                                   [_Count_ ARNOLD _and_ CAESAR _advance_.

    _Caes._ And the mere men--do they, too, sweat beneath
    The noon of this same ever-scorching glory?

    _Bourb._                                   Ah!
    Welcome the bitter Hunchback! and his master,
    The beauty of our host, and brave as beauteous,                    220
    And generous as lovely. We shall find
    Work for you both ere morning.

    _Caes._                        You will find,
    So please your Highness, no less for yourself.

    _Bourb._ And if I do, there will not be a labourer
    More forward, Hunchback!

    _Caes._                  You may well say so,
    For _you_ have seen that back--as general,
    Placed in the rear in action--but your foes
    Have never seen it.

    _Bourb._           That's a fair retort,
    For I provoked it:--but the Bourbon's breast
    Has been, and ever shall be, far advanced                          230
    In danger's face as yours, were you the _devil_.

    _Caes._ And if I were, I might have saved myself
    The toil of coming here.

    _Phil._                 Why so?

    _Caes._                         One half
    Of your brave bands of their own bold accord
    Will go to him, the other half be sent,
    More swiftly, not less surely.

    _Bourb._                      Arnold, your
    Slight crooked _friend's_ as snake-like in his words
    As his deeds.

    _Caes._        Your Highness much mistakes me.
    The first snake was a flatterer--I am none;
    And for my deeds, I only sting when stung.                         240

    _Bourb._ You are brave, and _that's_ enough for me; and quick
    In speech as sharp in action--and that's more.
    I am not alone the soldier, but the soldiers'
    Comrade.

    _Caes._   They are but bad company, your Highness;
    And worse even for their friends than foes, as being
    More permanent acquaintance.

    _Phil._                      How now, fellow!
    Thou waxest insolent, beyond the privilege
    Of a buffoon.

    _Caes._       You mean I speak the truth.
    I'll lie--it is as easy: then you'll praise me
    For calling you a hero.

    _Bourb._               Philibert!                                  250
    Let him alone; he's brave, and ever has
    Been first, with that swart face and mountain shoulder,
    In field or storm, and patient in starvation;
    And for his tongue, the camp is full of licence,
    And the sharp stinging of a lively rogue
    Is, to my mind, far preferable to
    The gross, dull, heavy, gloomy execration
    Of a mere famished sullen grumbling slave,[dl]
    Whom nothing can convince save a full meal,
    And wine, and sleep, and a few Maravedis,                          260
    With which he deems him rich.

    _Caes._                        It would be well
    If the earth's princes asked no more.

    _Bourb._                             Be silent!

    _Caes._ Aye, but not idle. Work yourself with words![dm]
    You have few to speak.

    _Phil._                What means the audacious prater?

    _Caes._ To prate, like other prophets.

    _Bourb._                              Philibert!
    Why will you vex him? Have we not enough
    To think on? Arnold! I will lead the attack
    To-morrow.

    _Arn._     I have heard as much, my Lord.

    _Bourb._ And you will follow?

    _Arn._                        Since I must not lead.

    _Bourb._ 'Tis necessary for the further daring
    Of our too needy army, that their chief
    Plant the first foot upon the foremost ladder's
    First step.

    _Caes._      Upon its topmost, let us hope:
    So shall he have his full deserts.

    _Bourb._                          The world's
    Great capital perchance is ours to-morrow.[dn]
    Through every change the seven-hilled city hath
    Retained her sway o'er nations, and the Caesars
    But yielded to the Alarics, the Alarics
    Unto the pontiffs. Roman, Goth, or priest.
    Still the world's masters! Civilised, barbarian,
    Or saintly, still the walls of Romulus
    Have been the circus of an Empire. Well!
    'Twas _their_ turn--now 'tis ours; and let us hope
    That we will fight as well, and rule much better.

    _Caes._ No doubt, the camp's the school of civic rights.
    What would you make of Rome?

    _Bourb._                    That which it was.

    _Caes._ In Alaric's time?

    _Bourb._                 No, slave! in the first Caesar's,
    Whose name you bear like other curs----

    _Caes._                             And kings!
    'Tis a great name for blood-hounds.

    _Bourb._                           There's a demon
    In that fierce rattlesnake thy tongue. Wilt never
    Be serious?

    _Caes._      On the eve of battle, no;--
    That were not soldier-like. 'Tis for the general
    To be more pensive: we adventurers
    Must be more cheerful. Wherefore should we think?
    Our tutelar Deity, in a leader's shape,
    Takes care of us. Keep thought aloof from hosts!
    If the knaves take to thinking, you will have
    To crack those walls alone.

    _Bourb._                    You may sneer, since
    'Tis lucky for you that you fight no worse for 't.

    _Caes._ I thank you for the freedom; 'tis the only                  300
    Pay I have taken in your Highness' service.

    _Bourb._ Well, sir, to-morrow you shall pay yourself.
    Look on those towers; they hold my treasury:
    But, Philibert, we'll in to council. Arnold,
    We would request your presence.

    _Arn._                          Prince! my service
    Is yours, as in the field.

    _Bourb._                   In both we prize it,
    And yours will be a post of trust at daybreak.

    _Caes._ And mine?

    _Bourb._         To follow glory with the Bourbon.
    Good night!

    _Arn._ (_to_ CAESAR). Prepare our armour for the assault,
    And wait within my tent.
                              [_Exeunt_ BOURBON, ARNOLD, PHILIBERT, _etc._

    _Caes._ (_solus_).       Within thy tent!                           310
    Think'st thou that I pass from thee with my presence?
    Or that this crooked coffer, which contained
    Thy principle of life, is aught to me
    Except a mask? And these are men, forsooth!
    Heroes and chiefs, the flower of Adam's bastards!
    This is the consequence of giving matter
    The power of thought. It is a stubborn substance,
    And thinks chaotically, as it acts,
    Ever relapsing into its first elements.
    Well! I must play with these poor puppets: 'tis                    320
    The Spirit's pastime in his idler hours.
    When I grow weary of it, I have business
    Amongst the stars, which these poor creatures deem
    Were made for them to look at. 'Twere a jest now
    To bring one down amongst them, and set fire
    Unto their anthill: how the pismires then
    Would scamper o'er the scalding soil, and, ceasing
    From tearing down each other's nests, pipe forth
    One universal orison! ha! ha!                          [_Exit_ CAESAR.




                                 PART II.


          SCENE I.--_Before the walls of Rome.--The Assault: the
          Army in motion, with ladders to scale the walls_;[238]
         BOURBON _with a white scarf over his armour, foremost_.

                     _Chorus of Spirits in the air_.

                    I.

    'Tis the morn, but dim and dark.[do]
    Whither flies the silent lark?
    Whither shrinks the clouded sun?
    Is the day indeed begun?
    Nature's eye is melancholy
    O'er the city high and holy:
    But without there is a din
    Should arouse the saints within,
    And revive the heroic ashes
    Round which yellow Tiber dashes.                                    10
    Oh, ye seven hills! awaken,
    Ere your very base be shaken!

                    II.

    Hearken to the steady stamp!
    Mars is in their every tramp!
    Not a step is out of tune,
    As the tides obey the moon!
    On they march, though to self-slaughter,
    Regular as rolling water,
    Whose high-waves o'ersweep the border
    Of huge moles, but keep their order,                                20
    Breaking only rank by rank.
    Hearken to the armour's clank!
    Look down o'er each frowning warrior,
    How he glares upon the barrier:
    Look on each step of each ladder,
    As the stripes that streak an adder.

                    III.

    Look upon the bristling wall,
    Manned without an interval!
    Round and round, and tier on tier,
    Cannon's black mouth, shining spear,                                30
    Lit match, bell-mouthed Musquetoon,
    Gaping to be murderous soon;
    All the warlike gear of old,
    Mixed with what we now behold,
    In this strife 'twixt old and new,
    Gather like a locusts' crew.
    Shade of Remus! 'tis a time
    Awful as thy brother's crime!
    Christians war against Christ's shrine:--
    Must its lot be like to thine?                                      40

                    IV.

    Near--and near--and nearer still,
    As the Earthquake saps the hill,
    First with trembling, hollow motion,
    Like a scarce awakened ocean,
    Then with stronger shock and louder,
    Till the rocks are crushed to powder,--
    Onward sweeps the rolling host!
    Heroes of the immortal boast!
    Mighty Chiefs! eternal shadows!
    First flowers of the bloody meadows                                 50
    Which encompass Rome, the mother
    Of a people without brother!
    Will you sleep when nations' quarrels
    Plough the root up of your laurels?
    Ye who weep o'er Carthage burning,
    Weep not--_strike_! for Rome is mourning![239]

                    V.

    Onward sweep the varied nations!
    Famine long hath dealt their rations.
    To the wall, with hate and hunger,
    Numerous as wolves, and stronger,                                   60
    On they sweep. Oh, glorious City!
    Must thou be a theme for pity?
    Fight, like your first sire, each Roman!
    Alaric was a gentle foeman,
    Matched with Bourbon's black banditti!
    Rouse thee, thou eternal City;
    Rouse thee! Rather give the torch
    With thine own hand to thy porch,[dp]
    Than behold such hosts pollute
    Your worst dwelling with their foot.                                70

                    VI.

    Ah! behold yon bleeding spectre!
    Ilion's children find no Hector;
    Priam's offspring loved their brother;
    Rome's great sire forgot his mother,
    When he slew his gallant twin,
    With inexpiable sin.
    See the giant shadow stride
    O'er the ramparts high and wide!
    When the first o'erleapt thy wall,
    Its foundation mourned thy fall.                                    80
    Now, though towering like a Babel,
    Who to stop his steps are able?
    Stalking o'er thy highest dome,
    Remus claims his vengeance, Rome!

                    VII.

    Now they reach thee in their anger:
    Fire and smoke and hellish clangour
    Are around thee, thou world's wonder!
    Death is in thy walls and under.
    Now the meeting steel first clashes,
    Downward then the ladder crashes,                                   90
    With its iron load all gleaming,
    Lying at its foot blaspheming!
    Up again! for every warrior
    Slain, another climbs the barrier.
    Thicker grows the strife: thy ditches
    Europe's mingling gore enriches.
    Rome! although thy wall may perish,
    Such manure thy fields will cherish,
    Making gay the harvest-home;
    But thy hearths, alas! oh, Rome!--                                 100
    Yet be Rome amidst thine anguish,
    Fight as thou wast wont to vanquish!

                    VIII.

    Yet once more, ye old Penates!
    Let not your quenched hearts be Ates!
    Yet again, ye shadowy Heroes,
    Yield not to these stranger Neros!
    Though the son who slew his mother
    Shed Rome's blood, he was your brother:
    'Twas the Roman curbed the Roman;--
    Brennus was a baffled foeman.                                      110
    Yet again, ye saints and martyrs,
    Rise! for yours are holier charters!
    Mighty Gods of temples falling,
    Yet in ruin still appalling!
    Mightier Founders of those altars,
    True and Christian,--strike the assaulters!
    Tiber! Tiber! let thy torrent
    Show even Nature's self abhorrent.
    Let each breathing heart dilated
    Turn, as doth the lion baited!                                     120
    Rome be crashed to one wide tomb,
    But be still the Roman's Rome![240]

                 [BOURBON, ARNOLD, CAESAR, _and others, arrive at the foot
                      of the wall_. ARNOLD _is about to plant his ladder_.

    _Bourb._ Hold, Arnold! I am first.

    _Arn._                             Not so, my Lord.

    _Bourb._ Hold, sir, I charge you! Follow! I am proud
    Of such a follower, but will brook no leader.
                        [BOURBON _plants his ladder, and begins to mount_.
    Now, boys! On! on!
                               [_A shot strikes him, and_ BOURBON _falls_.

    _Caes._             And off!

    _Arn._                     Eternal powers!
    The host will be appalled,--but vengeance! vengeance!

    _Bourb._ 'Tis nothing--lend me your hand.

                      [BOURBON _takes_ ARNOLD _by the hand, and rises; but
                            as he puts his foot on the step, falls again_.

                                           Arnold! I am sped.
    Conceal my fall[241]--all will go well--conceal it!
    Fling my cloak o'er what will be dust anon;                        130
    Let not the soldiers see it.

    _Arn._                     You must be
    Removed; the aid of----

    _Bourb._                No, my gallant boy!
    Death is upon me. But what is _one_ life?
    The Bourbon's spirit shall command them still.
    Keep them yet ignorant that I am but clay,
    Till they are conquerors--then do as you may.

    _Caes._ Would not your Highness choose to kiss the cross?
    We have no priest here, but the hilt of sword
    May serve instead:--it did the same for Bayard[242].

    _Bourb._ Thou bitter slave! to name _him_ at this time!            140
    But I deserve it.

    _Arn._ (_to_ CAESAR). Villain, hold your peace!

    _Caes._ What, when a Christian dies? Shall I not offer
    A Christian "Vade in pace[243]?"

    _Arn._                        Silence! Oh!
    Those eyes are glazing which o'erlooked the world,
    And saw no equal.

    _Bourb._          Arnold, shouldst thou see
    France----But hark! hark! the assault grows warmer--Oh!
    For but an hour, a minute more of life,
    To die within the wall! Hence, Arnold, hence!
    You lose time--they will conquer Rome without thee.

    _Arn._ And without _thee_.

    _Bourb._                   Not so; I'll lead them still            150
    In spirit. Cover up my dust, and breathe not
    That I have ceased to breathe. Away! and be
    Victorious.

    _Arn._      But I must not leave thee thus.

    _Bourb._ You must--farewell--Up! up! the world is winning.
                                                          [BOURBON _dies_.

    _Caes._ (_to_ ARNOLD). Come, Count, to business.

    _Arn._                      True. I'll weep hereafter.

                           [ARNOLD _covers_ BOURBON'S _body with a mantle,
                                mounts the ladder, crying_

    The Bourbon! Bourbon! On, boys! Rome is ours!

    _Caes._ Good night, Lord Constable! thou wert a Man.

                    [CAESAR _follows_ ARNOLD; _they reach the battlement;_
                        ARNOLD _and_ CAESAR _are struck down_.

    _Caes._ A precious somerset! Is your countship injured?

    _Arn._ No.                                     [_Remounts the ladder_.

    _Caes._ A rare blood-hound, when his own is heated!
    And 'tis no boy's play. Now he strikes them down!                  160
    His hand is on the battlement--he grasps it
    As though it were an altar; now his foot
    Is on it, and----What have we here?--a Roman?
    The first bird of the covey! he has fallen             [_A man falls_.
    On the outside of the nest. Why, how now, fellow?

    _Wounded Man_. A drop of water!

    _Caes._                         Blood's the only liquid
    Nearer than Tiber.

    _Wounded Man_. I have died for Rome.                          [_Dies_.

    _Caes._ And so did Bourbon, in another sense.
    Oh, these immortal men! and their great motives!
    But I must after my young charge. He is                            170
    By this time i' the Forum. Charge! charge!
                            [CAESAR _mounts the ladder; the scene closes_.

          SCENE II.--_The City_.--_Combats between the Besiegers
     and Besieged in the streets_. _Inhabitants flying in confusion_.

                             _Enter_ CAESAR.

    _Caes._ I cannot find my hero; he is mixed
    With the heroic crowd that now pursue
    The fugitives, or battle with the desperate.
    What have we here? A Cardinal or two
    That do not seem in love with martyrdom.
    How the old red-shanks scamper! Could they doff
    Their hose as they have doffed their hats, 'twould be
    A blessing, as a mark[244] the less for plunder.
    But let them fly; the crimson kennels now
    Will not much stain their stockings, since the mire                10
    Is of the self-same purple hue.

     _Enter a Party fighting_--ARNOLD _at the head of the Besiegers_.

                                   He comes,
    Hand in hand with the mild twins--Gore and Glory.[dq]
    Holla! hold, Count!

    _Arn._              Away! they must not rally.

    _Caes._ I tell thee, be not rash; a golden bridge
    Is for a flying enemy. I gave thee
    A form of beauty, and an
    Exemption from some maladies of body,
    But not of mind, which is not mine to give.
    But though I gave the form of Thetis' son,
    I dipped thee not in Styx; and 'gainst a foe                        20
    I would not warrant thy chivalric heart
    More than Pelides' heel; why, then, be cautious,
    And know thyself a mortal still.

    _Arn._                          And who
    With aught of soul would combat if he were
    Invulnerable? That were pretty sport.
    Think'st thou I beat for hares when lions roar?
                                         [ARNOLD _rushes into the combat_.

    _Caes._ A precious sample of humanity!
    Well, his blood's up; and, if a little's shed,
    'Twill serve to curb his fever.

                                [ARNOLD _engages with a Roman, who retires
                                    towards a portico_.

    _Arn._                          Yield thee, slave!
    I promise quarter.

    _Rom._            That's soon said.

    _Arn._                              And done----                     30
    My word is known.

    _Rom._           So shall be my deeds.
                                [_They re-engage_. CAESAR _comes forward_.

    _Caes._ Why, Arnold! hold thine own: thou hast in hand
    A famous artisan, a cunning sculptor;
    Also a dealer in the sword and dagger.
    Not so, my musqueteer; 'twas he who slew
    The Bourbon from the wall.[245]

    _Arn._                     Aye, did he so?
    Then he hath carved his monument.

    _Rom._                           I yet
    May live to carve your better's.

    _Caes._ Well said, my man of marble! Benvenuto,
    Thou hast some practice in both ways; and he                        40
    Who slays Cellini will have worked as hard
    As e'er thou didst upon Carrara's blocks.

                      [ARNOLD _disarms and wounds_ CELLINI, _hit slightly:
                          the latter draws a pistol, and fires; then
                          retires, and disappears through the portico_.

    _Caes._ How farest thou? Thou hast a taste, methinks,
    Of red Bellona's banquet.

    _Arn._ (_staggers_). 'Tis a scratch.
    Lend me thy scarf. He shall not 'scape me thus.

    _Caes._ Where is it?

    _Arn._             In the shoulder, not the sword arm--
    And that's enough. I am thirsty: would I had
    A helm of water!

    _Caes._           That's a liquid now
    In requisition, but by no means easiest
    To come at.

    _Arn._      And my thirst increases;--but                           50
    I'll find a way to quench it.

    _Caes._                       Or be quenched
    Thyself.

    _Arn._   The chance is even; we will throw
    The dice thereon. But I lose time in prating;
    Prithee be quick.                        [CAESAR _binds on the scarf_.
                     And what dost thou so idly?
    Why dost not strike?

    _Caes._              Your old philosophers
    Beheld mankind, as mere spectators of
    The Olympic games. When I behold a prize
    Worth wrestling for, I may be found a Milo.[246]

    _Arn._ Aye, 'gainst an oak.

    _Caes._                    A forest, when it suits me:
    I combat with a mass, or not at all.                                60
    Meantime, pursue thy sport as I do mine;
    Which is just now to gaze, since all these labourers
    Will reap my harvest gratis.

    _Arn._                       Thou art still
    A fiend!

    _Caes._   And thou--a man.

    _Arn._ Why, such I fain would show me.[dr]

    _Caes._                                 True--as men are.

    _Arn._ And what is that?

    _Caes._                  Thou feelest and thou see'st.

                        [_Exit_ ARNOLD, _joining in the combat which still
                           continues between detached parties. The
                           scene closes_.


        SCENE III.--_St. Peter's--The interior of the Church--The
         Pope at the Altar--Priests, etc., crowding in confusion,
          and Citizens flying for refuge, pursued by Soldiery_.

                             _Enter_ CAESAR.

    _A Spanish Soldier_. Down with them, comrades, seize upon those lamps!
    Cleave yon bald-pated shaveling to the chine!
    His rosary's of gold!

    _Lutheran Soldier_. Revenge! revenge!
    Plunder hereafter, but for vengeance now--
    Yonder stands Anti-Christ!

    _Caes._ (_interposing_).    How now, schismatic?
    What wouldst thou?

    _Luth. Sold._      In the holy name of Christ,
    Destroy proud Anti-Christ.[247] I am a Christian.

    _Caes._ Yea, a disciple that would make the founder
    Of your belief renounce it, could he see
    Such proselytes. Best stint thyself to plunder.                     10

    _Luth. Sold._ I say he is the Devil.

    _Caes._                               Hush! keep that secret,[ds]
    Lest he should recognise you for his own.

    _Luth. Sold._ Why would you save him? I repeat he is
    The Devil, or the Devil's vicar upon earth.

    _Caes._ And that's the reason: would you make a quarrel
    With your best friends? You had far best be quiet;
    His hour is not yet come.

    _Luth. Sold._            That shall be seen!

                             [_The Lutheran Soldier rushes forward: a shot
                                strikes him from one of the Pope's Guards,
                                and he falls at the foot of the Altar_.

    _Caes._ (_to the Lutheran_). I told you so.

    _Luth. Sold._               And will you not avenge me?

    _Caes._ Not I! You know that "Vengeance is the Lord's:"
    You see he loves no interlopers.

    _Luth. Sold._ (_dying_).         Oh!                                20
    Had I but slain him, I had gone on high,
    Crowned with eternal glory! Heaven, forgive
    My feebleness of arm that reached him not,
    And take thy servant to thy mercy. 'Tis
    A glorious triumph still; proud Babylon's
    No more; the Harlot of the Seven Hills
    Hath changed her scarlet raiment for sackcloth
    And ashes!                                       [_The Lutheran dies_.

    _Caes._     Yes, thine own amidst the rest.

                           Pontiff escapes, by a private passage, to the
                           Vatican and the Castle of St. Angelo_.[248]

    _Caes._                Ha! right nobly battled!
    Now, priest! now, soldier! the two great professions,               30
    Together by the ears and hearts! I have not
    Seen a more comic pantomime since Titus
    Took Jewry. But the Romans had the best then;
    Now they must take their turn.

    Follow!

    _Another Sold._ They have barred the narrow passage up,
    And it is clogged with dead even to the door.

    _Caes._ I am glad he hath escaped: he may thank me for't
    In part. I would not have his bulls abolished--
    'Twere worth one half our empire: his indulgences
    Demand some in return; no, no, he must not                          40
    Fall;--and besides, his now escape may furnish
    A future miracle, in future proof
    Of his infallibility.                      [_To the Spanish Soldiery_.
                         Well, cut-throats!
    What do you pause for? If you make not haste,
    There will not be a link of pious gold left.
    And _you_, too, Catholics! Would ye return
    From such a pilgrimage without a relic?

    See how they strip the shrines!

    He speaks the truth; the heretics will bear                         50
    The best away.

    _Caes._         And that were shame! Go to!
    Assist in their conversion.
             [_The Soldiers disperse; many quit the Church, others enter_.

    _Caes._                     They are gone,
    And others come: so flows the wave on wave
    Of what these creatures call Eternity,
    Deeming themselves the breakers of the Ocean,
    While they are but its bubbles, ignorant
    That foam is their foundation. So, another!

              _Enter_ OLIMPIA, _flying from the pursuit--She
                         springs upon the Altar_.

    _Sold._ She's mine!

    _Another Sold._ (_opposing the former_).
                       You lie, I tracked her first: and were she
    The Pope's niece, I'll not yield her.                   [_They fight_.

    _3d Sold._ (_advancing towards_ OLIMPIA). You may settle
    Your claims; I'll make mine good.

    _Olimp._                          Infernal slave!                   60
    You touch me not alive.

    _3d Sold._             Alive or dead!

    _Olimp._ (_embracing a massive crucifix_). Respect your God!

    _3d Sold._ Yes, when he shines in gold.
    Girl, you but grasp your dowry.

                     [_As he advances_, OLIMPIA, _with a strong and sudden
                           effort, casts down the crucifix; it strikes the
                           Soldier, who falls_.

    _3d Sold._                     Oh, great God!

    _Olimp._ Ah! now you recognise him.

    _3d Sold._                          My brain's crushed!
    Comrades, help, ho! All's darkness!                          [He dies.

    _Other Soldiers_ (_coming up_).
    Slay her, although she had a thousand lives:
    She hath killed our comrade.

    _Olimp._                     Welcome such a death!
    You have no life to give, which the worst slave
    Would take. Great God! through thy redeeming Son,
    And thy Son's Mother, now receive me as                             70
    I would approach thee, worthy her, and him, and thee!

                             _Enter_ ARNOLD.

    _Arn._ What do I see? Accursed jackals! Forbear!

    _Caes._ (_aside and laughing_). Ha! ha! here's equity! The dogs
    Have as much right as he. But to the issue!

    _Soldiers_. Count, she hath slain our comrade.

    _Arn._                                         With what weapon?

    _Sold._ The cross, beneath which he is crushed; behold him
    Lie there, more like a worm than man; she cast it
    Upon his head.

    _Arn._        Even so: there is a woman
    Worthy a brave man's liking. Were ye such,
    Ye would have honoured her. But get ye hence,                       80
    And thank your meanness, other God you have none,
    For your existence. Had you touched a hair
    Of those dishevelled locks, I would have thinned
    Your ranks more than the enemy. Away!
    Ye jackals! gnaw the bones the lion leaves,
    But not even these till he permits.

    _A Sold._ (_murmuring_).            The lion
    Might conquer for himself then.

    _Arn._ (_cuts him down_).      Mutineer!
    Rebel in hell--you shall obey on earth!
                                           [_The Soldiers assault_ ARNOLD.

    _Arn._ Come on! I'm glad on't! I will show you, slaves,
    How you should be commanded, and who led you                        90
    First o'er the wall you were so shy to scale,
    Until I waved my banners from its height,
    As you are bold within it.
         [ARNOLD _mows down the foremost; the rest throw down their arms_.

    _Soldiers_.                Mercy! mercy!

    _Arn._ Then learn to grant it. Have I taught you _who_
    Led you o'er Rome's eternal battlements?

    _Soldiers_. We saw it, and we know it; yet forgive
    A moment's error in the heat of conquest--
    The conquest which you led to.

    _Arn._                        Get you hence!
    Hence to your quarters! you will find them fixed
    In the Colonna palace.

    _Olimp._ (_aside_).   In my father's                               100
    House!

    _Arn._ (_to the Soldiers_). Leave your arms; ye have no further need
    Of such: the city's rendered. And mark well
    You keep your hands clean, or I'll find out a stream
    As red as Tiber now runs, for your baptism.

    _Soldiers_ (_deposing their arms and departing_). We obey!

    _Arn._ (_to_ OLIMPIA). Lady, you are safe.

    _Olimp._                                  I should be so,
    Had I a knife even; but it matters not--
    Death hath a thousand gates; and on the marble,
    Even at the altar foot, whence I look down
    Upon destruction, shall my head be dashed,
    Ere thou ascend it. God forgive thee, man!                         110

    _Arn._ I wish to merit his forgiveness, and
    Thine own, although I have not injured thee.

    _Olimp._ No! Thou hast only sacked my native land,--
    No injury!--and made my father's house
    A den of thieves! No injury!--this temple--
    Slippery with Roman and with holy gore!
    No injury! And now thou wouldst preserve me,
    To be----but that shall never be!

                [_She raises her eyes to Heaven, folds her robe round her,
                      and prepares to dash herself down on the side of
                      the Altar opposite to that where_ ARNOLD _stands_.

    _Arn._                           Hold! hold!
    I swear.

    _Olimp._ Spare thine already forfeit soul
    A perjury for which even Hell would loathe thee.                   120
    I know thee.

    _Arn._       No, thou know'st me not; I am not
    Of these men, though----

    _Olimp._                 I judge thee by thy mates;
    It is for God to judge thee as thou art.
    I see thee purple with the blood of Rome;
    Take mine, 'tis all thou e'er shalt have of me,
    And here, upon the marble of this temple,
    Where the baptismal font baptized me God's,
    I offer him a blood less holy
    But not less pure (pure as it left me then,
    A redeemed infant) than the holy water                             130
    The saints have sanctified!

                    [OLIMPIA _waves her hand to_ ARNOLD _with disdain, and
                          dashes herself on the pavement from the Altar_.

    _Arn._                      Eternal God!
    I feel thee now! Help! help! she's gone.

    _Caes._ (_approaches_).                  I am here.

    _Arn._ Thou! but oh, save her!

    _Caes._ (_assisting him to raise_ OLIMPIA). She hath done it well!
    The leap was serious.

    _Arn._                Oh! she is lifeless!

    _Caes._                                     If
    She be so, I have nought to do with that:
    The resurrection is beyond me.

    _Arn._                        Slave!

    _Caes._ Aye, slave or master, 'tis all one: methinks
    Good words, however, are as well at times.

    _Arn._ Words!--Canst thou aid her?

    _Caes._                           I will try. A sprinkling
    Of that same holy water may be useful.                             140
                            [_He brings some in his helmet from the font_.

    _Arn._ 'Tis mixed with blood.

    _Caes._                       There is no cleaner now
    In Rome.

    _Arn._ How pale! how beautiful! how lifeless!
    Alive or dead, thou Essence of all Beauty,
    I love but thee!

    _Caes._          Even so Achilles loved
    Penthesilea;[249] with his form it seems
    You have his heart, and yet it was no soft one.

    _Arn._ She breathes! But no, 'twas nothing, or the last
    Faint flutter Life disputes with Death.

    _Caes._                                 She breathes.

    _Arn._ _Thou_ say'st it? Then 'tis truth.

    _Caes._                                   You do me right--
    The Devil speaks truth much oftener than he's deemed:              150
    He hath an ignorant audience.

    _Arn._ (_without attending to him_). Yes! her heart beats.
    Alas! that the first beat of the only heart
    I ever wished to beat with mine should vibrate
    To an assassin's pulse.

    _Caes._                  A sage reflection,
    But somewhat late i' the day. Where shall we bear her?
    I say she lives.

    _Arn._          And will she live?

    _Cas._                             As much
    As dust can.

    _Arn._ Then she is dead!

    _Caes._                   Bah! bah! You are so,
    And do not know it. She will come to life--
    Such as you think so, such as you now are;
    But we must work by human means.

    _Arn._                          We will                            160
    Convey her unto the Colonna palace,
    Where I have pitched my banner.

    _Caes._                         Come then! raise her up!

    _Arn._ Softly!

    _Caes._        As softly as they bear the dead,
    Perhaps because they cannot feel the jolting.

    _Arn._ But doth she live indeed?

    _Caes._                           Nay, never fear!
    But, if you rue it after, blame not me.

    _Arn._ Let her but live!

    _Caes._                  The Spirit of her life
    Is yet within her breast, and may revive.
    Count! count! I am your servant in all things,
    And this is a new office:--'tis not oft                            170
    I am employed in such; but you perceive
    How staunch a friend is what you call a fiend.
    On earth you have often only fiends for friends;
    Now _I_ desert not mine. Soft! bear her hence,
    The beautiful half-clay, and nearly spirit!
    I am almost enamoured of her, as
    Of old the Angels of her earliest sex.[250]

    _Arn._ Thou!

    _Caes._      I! But fear not. I'll not be your rival.

    _Arn._ Rival!

    _Caes._       I could be one right formidable;
    But since I slew the seven husbands of                             180
    Tobias' future bride (and after all
    Was smoked out by some incense),[251] I have laid
    Aside intrigue: 'tis rarely worth the trouble
    Of gaining, or--what is more difficult--
    Getting rid of your prize again; for there's
    The rub! at least to mortals.

    _Arn._                       Prithee, peace!
    Softly! methinks her lips move, her eyes open!

    _Caes._ Like stars, no doubt; for that's a metaphor
    For Lucifer and Venus.

    _Arn._                To the palace
    Colonna, as I told you!

    _Caes._                 Oh! I know                                  190
    My way through Rome.

    _Arn._              Now onward, onward! Gently!
                           [_Exeunt, bearing_ OLIMPIA. _The scene closes_.




                                PART III.


      SCENE I.--_A Castle in the Apennines, surrounded by a wild but
      smiling Country. Chorus of Peasants singing before the Gates_.

                                _Chorus_.

                    I.

             The wars are over,
               The spring is come;
             The bride and her lover
               Have sought their home:
    They are happy, we rejoice;
    Let their hearts have an echo in every voice!

                    II.

    The spring is come; the violet's gone,
    The first-born child of the early sun:[dt]
    With us she is but a winter's flower,
    The snow on the hills cannot blast her bower,                       10
    And she lifts up her dewy eye of blue
    To the youngest sky of the self-same hue.

                    III.

    And when the spring comes with her host
    Of flowers, that flower beloved the most
    Shrinks from the crowd that may confuse
    Her heavenly odour and virgin hues.

                    IV.

    Pluck the others, but still remember
    Their herald out of dim December--
    The morning star of all the flowers,
    The pledge of daylight's lengthened hours;                          20
    Nor, midst the roses, e'er forget
    The virgin--virgin Violet.

                             _Enter_ CAESAR.

                          _Caes._ (_singing_).
    The wars are all over,
      Our swords are all idle,
      The steed bites the bridle,
    The casque's on the wall.
    There's rest for the rover;
      But his armour is rusty,
      And the veteran grows crusty,
    As he yawns in the hall.                                            30
      He drinks--but what's drinking?
      A mere pause from thinking!
    No bugle awakes him with life-and-death call.

                               _Chorus_.

        But the hound bayeth loudly,
          The boar's in the wood,
        And the falcon longs proudly
          To spring from her hood:
        On the wrist of the noble
          She sits like a crest,
        And the air is in trouble                                       40
          With birds from their nest.

                                _Caes_.
        Oh! shadow of Glory!
          Dim image of War!
        But the chase hath no story,
          Her hero no star,
        Since Nimrod, the founder
          Of empire and chase,
        Who made the woods wonder
          And quake for their race.
        When the lion was young,                                        50
          In the pride of his might,
        Then 'twas sport for the strong
          To embrace him in fight;
        To go forth, with a pine
          For a spear, 'gainst the mammoth,
        Or strike through the ravine[du]
          At the foaming behemoth;
        While man was in stature
          As towers in our time,
        The first born of Nature,                                       60
          And, like her, sublime!

                                    _Chorus_.

        But the wars are over,
          The spring is come;
        The bride and her lover
          Have sought their home:
    They are happy, and we rejoice;
    Let their hearts have an echo from every voice!
                                         [_Exeunt the Peasantry, singing_.




        FRAGMENT OF THE THIRD PART OF _THE DEFORMED TRANSFORMED_.


                                _Chorus_.

    When the merry bells are ringing,
    And the peasant girls are singing,
    And the early flowers are flinging
      Their odours in the air;
    And the honey bee is clinging
    To the buds; and birds are winging
      Their way, pair by pair:
    Then the earth looks free from trouble
    With the brightness of a bubble:
    Though I did not make it,                                           10
    I could breathe on and break it;
    But too much I scorn it,
    Or else I would mourn it,
    To see despots and slaves
    Playing o'er their own graves.

                          _Enter_ COUNT ARNOLD.

            {_Mem._ Jealous--Arnold of Caesar.
            {Olympia at first not liking Caesar
            {--then?--Arnold jealous of himself
            {under his former figure, owing to
            {the power of intellect, etc., etc., etc.

    _Arnold_. You are merry, Sir--what? singing too?

    _Caesar_.                                         It is
    The land of Song--and Canticles you know
    Were once my avocation.

    _Arn._              Nothing moves you;
    You scoff even at your own calamity--
    And such calamity! how wert thou fallen                             20
    Son of the Morning! and yet Lucifer
    Can smile.

    _Caes._     His shape can--would you have me weep,
    In the fair form I wear, to please you?

    _Arn._                                 Ah!

    _Caes._ You are grave--what have you on your spirit!

    _Arn._                                               Nothing.

    _Caes._ How mortals lie by instinct! If you ask
    A disappointed courtier--What's the matter?
    "Nothing"--an outshone Beauty what has made
    Her smooth brow crisp--"Oh, Nothing!"--a young heir
    When his Sire has recovered from the Gout,
    What ails him? "Nothing!" or a Monarch who 30
    Has heard the truth, and looks imperial on it--
    What clouds his royal aspect? "Nothing," "Nothing!"
    Nothing--eternal nothing--of these nothings
    All are a lie--for all to them are much!
    And they themselves alone the real "Nothings."
    Your present Nothing, too, is something to you--
    What is it?

    _Arn._      Know you not?

    _Caes._                   I only know
    What I desire to know! and will not waste
    Omniscience upon phantoms. Out with it!
    If you seek aid from me--or else be silent.                         40
    And eat your thoughts--till they breed snakes within you.

    _Arn._ Olimpia!

    _Caes._          I thought as much--go on.

    _Arn._ I thought she had loved me.

    _Caes._                             Blessings on your Creed!
    What a good Christian you were found to be!
    But what cold Sceptic hath appalled your faith
    And transubstantiated to crumbs again
    The _body_ of your Credence?

    _Arn._                      No one--but--
    Each day--each hour--each minute shows me more
    And more she loves me not--

    _Caes._                     Doth she rebel?

    _Arn._ No, she is calm, and meek, and silent with me,               50
    And coldly dutiful, and proudly patient--
    Endures my Love--not meets it.

    _Caes._                        That seems strange.
    You are beautiful and brave! the first is much
    For passion--and the rest for Vanity.

    _Arn._ I saved her life, too; and her Father's life,
    And Father's house from ashes.

    _Caes._                        These are nothing.
    You seek for Gratitude--the Philosopher's stone.

    _Arn._ And find it not.

    _Caes._                  You cannot find what is not.
    But _found_ would it content you? would you owe
    To thankfulness what you desire from Passion?                       60
    No! No! you would be _loved_--what you call loved--
    _Self-loved_--loved for _yourself_--for neither health,
    Nor wealth, nor youth, nor power, nor rank, nor beauty--
    For these you may be stript of--but _beloved_
    As an abstraction--for--you know not what!
    These are the wishes of a moderate lover--
    And _so_ you love.

    _Arn._             Ah! could I be beloved,
    Would I ask wherefore?

    _Caes._               Yes! and not believe
    The answer--You are jealous.

    _Arn._                       And of whom?

    _Caes._ It may be of yourself,[252] for Jealousy                     70
    Is as a shadow of the Sun. The Orb
    Is mighty--as you mortals deem--and to
    Your little Universe seems universal;
    But, great as He appears, and is to you,
    The smallest cloud--the slightest vapour of
    Your humid earth enables you to look
    Upon a Sky which you revile as dull;
    Though your eyes dare not gaze on it when cloudless.
    Nothing can blind a mortal like to light.
    Now Love in you is as the Sun--a thing                              80
    Beyond you--and your Jealousy's of Earth--
    A cloud of your own raising.

    _Arn._                       Not so always!
    There is a cause at times.

    _Caes._                    Oh, yes! when atoms jostle,
    The System is in peril. But I speak
    Of things you know not. Well, to earth again!
    This precious thing of dust--this bright Olimpia--
    This marvellous Virgin, is a marble maid--
    An Idol, but a cold one to your heat
    Promethean, and unkindled by your torch.

    _Arn._ Slave!

    _Caes._         In the victor's Chariot, when Rome triumphed,        90
    There was a Slave of yore to tell him truth!
    You are a Conqueror--command your Slave.

    _Arn._ Teach me the way to win the woman's love.

    _Caes._ Leave her.

    _Arn._            Where that the path--I'd not pursue it.

    _Caes._ No doubt! for if you did, the remedy
    Would be for a disease already cured.

    _Arn._ All wretched as I am, I would not quit
    My unrequited love, for all that's happy.

    _Caes._ You have possessed the woman--still possess.
    What need you more?

    _Arn._         To be myself possessed--                            100
    To be her heart as she is mine.

FOOTNOTES:

[201] {473}[_The Three Brothers_, by Joshua Pickersgill, junior, was
published in 1803. There is no copy of _The Three Brothers_ in the
British Museum. The following extracts are taken from a copy in the
Bodleian Library at Oxford (vol. 4, cap. xi. pp. 229-350):--

"Arnaud, the natural son of the Marquis de Souvricour, was a child
'extraordinary in Beauty and Intellect.' When travelling with his
parents to Languedoc, Arnaud being 8 years old, he was shot at by
banditti, and forsaken by his parents. The Captain of the band nursed
him. 'But those perfections to which Arnaud owed his existence, ceased
to adorn it. The ball had gored his shoulder, and the fall had
dislocated it; by the latter misadventure his spine likewise was so
fatally injured as to be irrecoverable to its pristine uprightness.
Injuries so compound confounded the Captain, who sorrowed to see a
creature so charming, at once deformed by a crooked back and an
excrescent shoulder.' Arnaud was found and taken back to his parents.
'The bitterest consciousness of his deformity was derived from their
indelicate, though, perhaps, insensible alteration of conduct.... Of his
person he continued to speak as of an abhorrent enemy.... "Were a
blessing submitted to my choice, I would say, [said Arnaud] be it my
immediate dissolution." "I think," said his mother, ... "that you could
wish better." "Yes," adjoined Arnaud, "for that wish should be that I
ever had remained unborn."' He polishes the broken blade of a sword, and
views himself therein; the sight so horrifies him that he determines to
throw himself over a precipice, but draws back at the last moment. He
goes to a cavern, and conjures up the prince of hell. "Arnaud knew
himself to be interrogated. What he required.... What was that answer
the effects explain.... There passed in liveliest portraiture the
various men distinguished for that beauty and grace which Arnaud so much
desired, that he was ambitious to purchase them with his soul. He felt
that it was his part to chuse whom he would resemble, yet he remained
unresolved, though the spectator of an hundred shades of renown, among
which glided by Alexander, Alcibiades, and Hephestion: at length
appeared the supernatural effigy of a man, whose perfections human
artist never could depict or insculp--Demetrius, the son of Antigonus.
Arnaud's heart heaved quick with preference, and strait he found within
his hand the resemblance of a poniard, its point inverted towards his
breast. A mere automaton in the hands of the Demon, he thrust the point
through his heart, and underwent a painless death. During his trance,
his spirit metempsychosed from the body of his detestation to that of
his admiration ... Arnaud awoke a Julian!'"]

re-cast as _One O'clock; or, The Knight and the Wood-Demon_, 1811), see
"First Visit to the Theatre in London," _Poems_, by Hartley Coleridge,
1851, i., Appendix C, pp. cxcix.-cciii. The _Wood Demon_ in its original
form was never published.]

[203] [Mrs. Shelley inscribed the following note on the fly-leaf of her
copy of _The Deformed Transformed_:--

"This had long been a favourite subject with Lord Byron. I think that he
mentioned it also in Switzerland. I copied it--he sending a portion of
it at a time, as it was finished, to me. At this time he had a great
horror of its being said that he plagiarised, or that he studied for
ideas, and wrote with difficulty. Thus he gave Shelley Aikins' edition
of the British poets, that it might not be found in his house by some
English lounger, and reported home; thus, too, he always dated when he
began and when he ended a poem, to prove hereafter how quickly it was
done. I do not think that he altered a line in this drama after he had
once written it down. He composed and corrected in his mind. I do not
know how he meant to finish it; but he said himself that the whole
conduct of the story was already conceived. It was at this time that a
brutal paragraph[*] alluding to his lameness appeared, which he repeated
to me lest I should hear it from some one else. No action of Lord
Byron's life--scarce a line he has written--but was influenced by his
personal defect."

[*] It is possible that Mrs. Shelley alludes to a sentence in the
_Memoirs, etc., of Lord Byron_. (by Dr. John Watkin), 1822, p. 46: "A
malformation of one of his feet, and other indications of a rickety
constitution, served as a plea for suffering him to range the hills and
to wander about at his pleasure on the seashore, that his frame might be
invigorated by air and exercise."]

[cv] {477} _The Deformed--a drama.--B. Pisa, 1822_.

[204] [Moore (_Life_, p. 13) quotes these lines in connection with a
passage in Byron's "Memoranda," where, in speaking of his own
sensitiveness on the subject of his deformed foot, he described the
feeling of horror and humiliation that came over him, when his mother,
in one of her fits of passion, called him "_a lame brat!_"... "It may
be questioned," he adds, "whether that whole drama [_The Deformed
Transformed_] was not indebted for its origin to that single
recollection."

Byron's early letters (_e.g._ November 2, 11, 17, 1804, _Letters_, 1898,
i. 41, 45, 48) are full of complaints of his mother's "eccentric
behaviour," her "fits of phrenzy," her "caprices," "passions," and so
forth; and there is convincing proof--see _Life_, pp. 28, 306;
_Letters_, 1898, ii. 122 (incident at Bellingham's execution);
_Letters_, 1901, vi. 179 (_Le Diable Boiteux_)--that he regarded the
contraction of the muscles of his legs as a more or less repulsive
deformity. And yet, to quote one of a hundred testimonies,--"with regard
to Lord Byron's features, Mr. Mathews observed, that he was the only man
he ever contemplated, to whom he felt disposed to apply the word
_beautiful_" (_Memoirs of Charles Matthews_, 1838, ii. 380). The
looker-on or the consoler computes the magnitude and the liberality of
the compensation. The sufferer thinks only of his sufferings.]

[217] [The beauty and mien [of Demetrius Poliorcetes] were so inimitable
that no statuary or painter could hit off a likeness. His countenance
had a mixture of grace and dignity; and was at once amiable and awful;
and the unsubdued and eager air of youth was blended with the majesty of
the hero and the king.--Plutarch's _Lives_, Langhorne's Translation,
1838, p. 616.

Demetrius the Besieger rescued Greece from the sway of Ptolemy and
Cassander, B.C. 307. He passed the following winter at Athens, where
divine honours were paid to him under the title of "the Preserver" (?
????? [o(Sote/r]). He was "the shame of Greece in peace," by reason of
his profligacy--"the citadel was so polluted with his debaucheries, that
it appeared to be kept sacred in some degree when he indulged himself
only with such _Hetaerae_ as Chrysis, Lamia, Demo, and Anticyra." He was
the unspiritual ancestor of Charles the Second. Once when his father,
Antigonus, had been told that he was indisposed, "he went to see him;
and when he came to the door, he met one of his favourites going out. He
went in, however, and, sitting down by him, took hold of his hand. 'My
fever,' said Demetrius, 'has left me.' 'I knew it,' said Antigonus, 'for
I met it this moment at the door.'"--Plutarch's _Lives_, _ibid._, pp.
621-623.]

are extreme bold; first, as in their own defence, as being exposed to

them industry, and especially of this kind, to watch and observe the
weakness of others, that they may have somewhat to repay." (Essay
xliv.). Byron's "chief incentive, when a boy, to distinction was that
mark of deformity on his person, by an acute sense of which he was first
stung into the ambition of being great."--_Life_, p. 306.]

1155, was the first to record the musical note which sounded from the
statue when it was touched by the rays of the rising sun. It used to be
argued (see Gifford's note to _Don Juan_, Canto XIII. stanza lxiv. line
3, ed. 1837, p. 731) that the sounds were produced by a trick, but of
late years it has been maintained that the Memnon's wail was due to
natural causes, the pressure of suddenly-warmed currents of air through
the pores and crevices of the stone. After the statue was restored, the
phenomenon ceased. (See _La statue vocale de Memnon_, par J. A. Letronne,

[230] [Charles de Bourbon, Comte de Montpensier et de la Marche, Dauphin
d'Auvergne, was born February 17, 1490. He served in Italy with Bayard,
and helped to decide the victory of Agnadello (A.D. 1510). He was
appointed Constable of France by Francis I., January, 1515, and fought
at the battle of Marignano, September 13, 1515. Not long afterwards he
lost the king's favour, who was set against him by his mother, Louise de
Savoie; was recalled from his command in Italy, and superseded by Odet
de Foix, brother of the king's mistress. It was not, however, till he
became a widower (Susanne, Duchesse de Bourbon, died April 28, 1521)
that he finally broke with Francis and attached himself to the Emperor
Charles V. _Madame_, the king's mother, not only coveted the vast
estates of the house of Bourbon, but was enamoured of the Constable's
person, and, so to speak, gave him his choice between marriage and a
suit for his fiefs. Charles would have nothing to say to the lady's
proposals or to her son's entreaties, and seeing that rejection meant
ruin, he "entered into a correspondence with the Emperor and the King
[Henry VIII.] of England ... and, finding this discovered, went into the
Emperor's service."

After various and varying successes, both in the South of France and in
Lombardy, he found himself, in the spring of 1527, not so much the
commander-in-chief as the popular _capo_ of a mixed body of German,
Spanish, and Italian _condottieri_, unpaid and ill-disciplined, who had
mutinied more than once, who could only be kept together by the prospect
of unlimited booty, and a timely concession to their demands. "To Rome!
to Rome!" cried the hungry and tumultuous _landsknechts_, and on May 5,
1527, the "late Constable of France," at the head of an army of 30,000
troops, appeared before the walls of the sacred city. On the morning of
the 6th of May, he was killed by a shot from an arquebuse. His epitaph
recounts his honours: "Aucto Imperio, Gallo victo, Superata Italia,
Pontifice obsesso, Roma capta, Borbonius, Hic Jacet;" but in Paris they
painted the sill of his gate-way yellow, because he was a renegade and a
traitor. He could not have said, with the dying Bayard, "Ne me plaignez
pas-je meurs sans avoir servi contre _ma patrie, mon roy_, et mon
serment." (See _Modern Universal History_, 1760, xxiv. 150-152, Note C;

cautiously up to the walls, and observing a most extraordinary
confusion, I discovered afterwards that one of our shots had killed the
Constable of Bourbon; and from what I subsequently learned he was the
man whom I had first noticed above the heads of the rest." It is a fact
"that Bourbon was shot dead near the spot Cellini mentions. But the
honour of flying the arquebuse ... cannot be assigned to any one in
particular."--_Life of Benvenuto Cellini_, 1888, i. 114, and note.]

[247] {520}[Among the Imperial troops which Charles de Bourbon led
against Rome were at least six thousand Landsknechts, ardent converts to
the Reformed religion, and eager to prove their zeal by the slaughter of
Catholics and the destruction of altars and crucifixes. Their leader,
George Frundsberg, had set out for Rome with the pious intention of
hanging the Pope (see _The Popes of Rome_, by Leopold Ranke, translated
by Sarah Austen, 1866, i. 72). Brantome (_Memoirs de Messire Pierre de
Bourdeille_.... Leyde, 1722, i. 230) gives a vivid picture of their
fanatical savagery: "Leur cruaute ne s'estendit pas seulement sur les
personnes, mais sur les marbres et les anciennes statues. Les
Lansquenets, qui nouvellement estoient imbus de la nouvelle Religion, et
les Espagnols encore aussi bien que les autres, s'habilloient en
Cardinaux et evesques en leur habits Pontificaux et se pourmenoient
ainsi parray la Ville."

In the Schmalkald articles, 1530, the pious belief that the Pope was
Antichrist became an article of the Lutheran creed. Compare the
following extracts, quoted by Hans Schultz in _Der Sacco di Roma_, 1894,
p. 63, from the _Historia von der Romischen Bischoff, etc._, 1527:

"Der Papst ist fur den Verfasser der Antichrist, der durch Lug und Trug
seine Herrschaft in der Welt behauptet."

"Quant a l'armee imperiale, on n'en vit jamais de plus etonnante....
Allemands et Espagnols, lutheriens iconoclastes qui brulaient les
eglises, ou furieux mystiques qui brulaient Juils et Maures, barbares
plus raffines que _leur vieux ancetres les Visigoths, les Vandales et
les Huns_, ils frappaient l'Italie d'une terreur sans exemple."--_De

                   INTRODUCTION TO _THE AGE OF BRONZE_.


_The Age of Bronze_ was begun in December, 1822, and finished on January
10, 1823. "I have sent," he writes (letter to Leigh Hunt, _Letters_,
1901, vi. 160), "to Mrs. S[helley], for the benefit of being copied, a
poem of about seven hundred and fifty lines length--The Age of
Bronze,--or _Carmen Seculare et Annus haud Mirabilis_, with this
Epigraph--'Impar _Congressus_ Achilli.' It is calculated for the reading
part of the million, being all on politics, etc., etc., etc., and a
review of the day in general,--in my early _English Bards_ style, but a
little more stilted, and somewhat too full of 'epithets of war' and
classical and historical allusions. If notes are necessary, they can be
added."

On March 5th he forwarded the "Proof in Slips" ("and certainly the
_Slips_ are the most conspicuous part of it") to his new publisher, John
Hunt; and, on April 1, 1823, _The Age of Bronze_ was published, but not
with the author's name.

Ten years had gone by since he had published, only to disclaim, the
latest of his boyish satires, _The Waltz_, and more than six years since
he had written, "at the request of Douglas Kinnaird," the stilted and
laboured _Monody on the Death of ... Sheridan_. In the interval
(1816-1822) he had essayed any and every measure but the heroic, and, at
length, as a tardy recognition of his allegiance to "the great moral
poet of all times, of all climes, of all feelings, and of all stages of
existence" (_Observations upon "Observations,"_ _Letters_, 1901, v.
590), he reverts, as he believes, to his "early _English Bards_ style,"
the style of Pope.

The brazen age, the "Annus Haud Mirabilis," which the satirist would
hold up to scorn, was 1822, the year after Napoleon's death, which
witnessed a revolution in Spain, and the Congress of Allied Sovereigns
at Verona. Earlier in the year, the publication of Las Cases' _Memorial
de S^te^ Helene_, and of O'Meara's _Napoleon in Exile, or a Voice from
St. Helena_, had created a sensation on both sides of the Channel.
Public opinion had differed as to the system on which Napoleon should be
treated--and, since his death, there had been a conflict of evidence as
to the manner in which he had been treated, at St. Helena. Tories
believed that an almost excessive lenience and indulgence had been
wasted on a graceless and thankless intriguer, while the "Opposition,"
Liberals or Radicals, were moved to indignation at the hardships and
restrictions which were ruthlessly and needlessly imposed on a fallen
and powerless foe. It was, and is, a very pretty quarrel; and Byron,
whose lifelong admiration for his "Heros de Roman" was tempered by
reason, approached the Longwood controversy somewhat in the spirit of a
partisan.

In _The Age of Bronze_ (sects, iii.-v.) he touches on certain incidents
of the "Last Phase" of Napoleon's career, and proceeds to recapitulate,
in a sort of _Memoria Technica_, the chief events of his history, from
the dawn at Marengo to the sunset at "bloody and most bootless
Waterloo," and draws the unimpeachable moral that "Honesty is the best
policy," even when the "game is Empire" and "the stakes are thrones"!

From the rise and fall, the tyranny and captivity of Napoleon, he passes
on to the Congress of Allied Powers, which met at Verona in November,
1822.

The "Congress" is the object of his satire. It had assembled with a
parade of power and magnificence, and had dispersed with little or
nothing accomplished. It was "impar Achilli" (_vide ante_, p. 535,
note 1), an empty menace, ill-matched with the revolutionary spirit,
and in pitiful contrast to the _Sic volo, sic jubeo_ of the dead
Napoleon.

The immediate and efficient cause of the Congress of Verona was the
success of the revolution in Spain. The point at issue between Spanish
Liberals and Royalists, or _serviles_, was the adherence to, or the
evasion of, the democratic Constitution of 1812. At the moment the
Liberals were in the ascendant, and, as Chateaubriand puts it, had
driven King Ferdinand into captivity, at Urgel, in Catalonia, to the
tune of the Spanish Marseillaise, "_Tragala, Tragala_" "swallow it,
swallow it," that is, "accept the Constitution." On July 7, 1822, a
government was established under the name of the "Supreme Regency of
Spain during the Captivity of the King," and, hence, the consternation
of the partners of the Holy Alliance, especially France, who conceived,
or feigned to conceive, that revolution next door was a source of danger
to constitutional government at home. To meet the emergency, a Congress
was summoned in the first instance at Vienna, and afterwards at Verona.
Thither came the sovereigns of Europe, great and small, accompanied by
their chancellors and ministers. The Czar Alexander was attended by
Count Nesselrode and Count Pozzo di Borgo; the Emperor Francis of
Austria, by Metternich and Prince Esterhazy; the King of Prussia
(Frederic William III.), by Count Bernstorff and Baron Humboldt. George
IV. of Great Britain, and Louis XVIII. of France, being elderly and
gouty, sent as their plenipotentiaries the Duke of Wellington and the
Vicomte de Montmorenci, accompanied, and, finally, superseded by, the
French ambassador, M. de Chateaubriand. Thither, too, came the smaller
fry, Kings of the Two Sicilies and of Sardinia; and last, but not least,
Marie Louise of Austria, Archduchess of Parma, _ci-devant_ widow of
Napoleon, and wife _sub rosa_ of her one-eyed chamberlain, Count de
Neipperg. They met, they debated, they went to the theatre in state, and
finally decided to send monitory despatches to Spain, and to leave to
France a free hand to look after her own interests, and to go to war or
not, as she was pleased to determine. There was one dissentient, the
Duke of Wellington, who refused to sign the _proces verbaux_. His
Britannic Majesty had been advised to let the Spaniards alone, and not
to meddle with their internal affairs. The final outcome of the
Congress, the French invasion of Spain, could not be foreseen; and,
apparently, all that the Congress had accomplished was to refuse to
prohibit the exportation of negroes from Africa to America, and to
decline to receive the Greek deputies.

As the _Morning Chronicle_ (November 7, 1822) was pleased to put it,
"the Royal vultures have been deprived of their anticipated meal."

From the Holy Alliance and its antagonist, "the revolutionary stork,"
Byron turns to the landed and agricultural "interest" of Great Britain.
With the cessation of war and the resumption of cash payments in 1819,
prices had fallen some 50 per cent., and rents were beginning to fall.
Wheat, which in 1818 had fetched 80s. a quarter, in December, 1822, was
quoted at 39s. 11d.; consols were at 80. Poor rates had risen from
?2,000,000 in 1792 to ?8,000,000 in 1822. How was the distress which
these changes involved to be met? By retrenchment and reform, by the
repeal of taxes, the reduction of salaries, by the landlords and
farmers, who had profited by war prices, submitting to the inevitable
reaction; or by sliding scales, by a return to an inflated currency,
perhaps by a repudiation of a portion of the funded debt?

The point of Byron's diatribe is that Squire Dives had enjoyed good
things during the war, and, now that the war was over, he had no
intention to let Lazarus have his turn; that, whoever suffered, it
should not be Dives; that patriotism had brought grist to his mill; and
that he proposed to suck no small advantage out of peace.

    "Year after year they voted cent. per cent.,
    Blood, sweat, and tear-wrung millions--why? for rent?
    They roared, they dined, they drank, they swore they meant
    To die for England--why then live?--for rent!"

It is easier to divine the "Sources" and the inspiration of _The Age of
Bronze_ than to place the reader _au courant_ with the literary and
political _causerie_ of the day. Byron wrote with O'Meara's book at his
elbow, and with batches of _Galignani's Messenger_, the _Morning
Chronicle_, and _Cobbett's Weekly Register_ within his reach. He was
under the impression that his lines would appear as an anonymous
contribution to _The Liberal_, and, in any case, he felt that he could
speak out, unchecked and uncriticized by friend or publisher. He was, so
to speak, unmuzzled.

With regard to the style and quality of his new satire, Byron was under
an amiable delusion. His couplets, he imagined, were in his "early
_English Bards_ style," but "more stilted." He did not realize that,
whatever the intervening years had taken away, they had "left behind"
experience and passion, and that he had learned to think and to feel.
The fault of the poem is that too much matter is packed into too small a
compass, and that, in parts, every line implies a minute acquaintance
with contemporary events, and requires an explanatory note. But, even
so, in _The Age of Bronze_ Byron has wedded "a striking passage of
history" to striking and imperishable verse.

                            THE AGE OF BRONZE.


                    I.

    The "good old times"--all times when old are good--
    Are gone; the present might be if they would;
    Great things have been, and are, and greater still
    Want little of mere mortals but their will:[dw]
    A wider space, a greener field, is given
    To those who play their "tricks before high heaven."[254]
    I know not if the angels weep, but men
    Have wept enough--for what?--to weep again!


                    II.

    All is exploded--be it good or bad.
    Reader! remember when thou wert a lad,                              10
    Then Pitt was all; or, if not all, so much,
    His very rival almost deemed him such.[255]
    We--we have seen the intellectual race
    Of giants stand, like Titans, face to face--
    Athos and Ida, with a dashing sea
    Of eloquence between, which flowed all free,
    As the deep billows of the AEgean roar
    Betwixt the Hellenic and the Phrygian shore.
    But where are they--the rivals! a few feet
    Of sullen earth divide each winding sheet.[256]                     20
    How peaceful and how powerful is the grave,
    Which hushes all! a calm, unstormy wave,
    Which oversweeps the World. The theme is old
    Of "Dust to Dust," but half its tale untold:
    Time tempers not its terrors--still the worm
    Winds its cold folds, the tomb preserves its form,
    Varied above, but still alike below;
    The urn may shine--the ashes will not glow--
    Though Cleopatra's mummy cross the sea[257]
    O'er which from empire she lured Anthony;                           30
    Though Alexander's urn[258] a show be grown
    On shores he wept to conquer, though unknown--[259]
    How vain, how worse than vain, at length appear
    The madman's wish, the Macedonian's tear!
    He wept for worlds to conquer--half the earth
    Knows not his name, or but his death, and birth,
    And desolation; while his native Greece
    Hath all of desolation, save its peace.
    He "wept for worlds to conquer!" he who ne'er
    Conceived the Globe, he panted not to spare!                        40
    With even the busy Northern Isle unknown,
    Which holds his urn--and never knew his throne.


                    III.

    But where is he, the modern, mightier far,
    Who, born no king, made monarchs draw his car;
    The new Sesostris, whose unharnessed kings,[260]
    Freed from the bit, believe themselves with wings,
    And spurn the dust o'er which they crawled of late,
    Chained to the chariot of the Chieftain's state?
    Yes! where is he, "the champion and the child"[261]
    Of all that's great or little--wise or wild;                        50
    Whose game was Empire, and whose stakes were thrones;
    Whose table Earth--whose dice were human bones?
    Behold the grand result in yon lone Isle,
    And, as thy nature urges--weep or smile.
    Sigh to behold the Eagle's lofty rage
    Reduced to nibble at his narrow cage;
    Smile to survey the queller of the nations
    Now daily squabbling o'er disputed rations;[dx][262]
    Weep to perceive him mourning, as he dines,
    O'er curtailed dishes and o'er stinted wines;                       60
    O'er petty quarrels upon petty things.
    Is this the Man who scourged or feasted kings?
    Behold the scales in which his fortune hangs,
    A surgeon's[263] statement, and an earl's[264] harangues!
    A bust delayed,[265]--a book[266] refused, can shake
    The sleep of Him who kept the world awake.
    Is this indeed the tamer of the Great,[dy]
    Now slave of all could tease or irritate--
    The paltry gaoler[267] and the prying spy,
    The staring stranger with his note-book nigh?[268]                  70
    Plunged in a dungeon, he had still been great;
    How low, how little was this middle state,
    Between a prison and a palace, where
    How few could feel for what he had to bear!
    Vain his complaint,--My Lord presents his bill,
    His food and wine were doled out duly still;
    Vain was his sickness, never was a clime
    So free from homicide--to doubt's crime;
    And the stiff surgeon,[269] who maintained his cause,
    Hath lost his place, and gained the world's applause.               80
    But smile--though all the pangs of brain and heart
    Disdain, defy, the tardy aid of art;
    Though, save the few fond friends and imaged face
    Of that fair boy his Sire shall ne'er embrace,
    None stand by his low bed--though even the mind
    Be wavering, which long awed and awes mankind:
    Smile--for the fettered Eagle breaks his chain,
    And higher Worlds than this are his again.[270]


                    IV.

    How, if that soaring Spirit still retain
    A conscious twilight of his blazing reign,                          90
    How must he smile, on looking down, to see
    The little that he was and sought to be!
    What though his Name a wider empire found
    Than his Ambition, though with scarce a bound;
    Though first in glory, deepest in reverse,
    He tasted Empire's blessings and its curse;
    Though kings, rejoicing in their late escape
    From chains, would gladly be _their_ Tyrant's ape;
    How must he smile, and turn to yon lone grave,
    The proudest Sea-mark that o'ertops the wave!                      100
    What though his gaoler, duteous to the last,
    Scarce deemed the coffin's lead could keep him fast,
    Refusing one poor line[271] along the lid,
    To date the birth and death of all it hid;
    That name shall hallow the ignoble shore,
    A talisman to all save him who bore:
    The fleets that sweep before the eastern blast
    Shall hear their sea-boys[272] hail it from the mast;
    When Victory's Gallic column[273] shall but rise,
    Like Pompey's pillar[274], in a desert's skies,                    110
    The rocky Isle that holds or held his dust,
    Shall crown the Atlantic like the Hero's bust,
    And mighty Nature o'er his obsequies
    Do more than niggard Envy still denies.
    But what are these to him? Can Glory's lust
    Touch the freed spirit or the fettered dust?
    Small care hath he of what his tomb consists;
    Nought if he sleeps--nor more if he exists:
    Alike the better-seeing Shade will smile
    On the rude cavern[275] of the rocky isle,                         120
    As if his ashes found their latest home
    In Rome's Pantheon or Gaul's mimic dome[276].
    He wants not this; but France shall feel the want
    Of this last consolation, though so scant:
    Her Honour--Fame--and Faith demand his bones,
    To rear above a Pyramid of thrones;
    Or carried onward in the battle's van,
    To form, like Guesclin's dust, her Talisman[277].
    But be it as it is--the time may come
    His name shall beat the alarm, like Ziska's drum[278].             130


                    V.

    Oh Heaven! of which he was in power a feature;
    Oh Earth! of which he was a noble creature;
    Thou Isle! to be remembered long and well,
    That saw'st the unfledged eaglet chip his shell!
    Ye Alps which viewed him in his dawning flights
    Hover, the Victor of a hundred fights!
    Thou Rome, who saw'st thy Caesar's deeds outdone!
    Alas! why passed he too the Rubicon--
    The Rubicon of Man's awakened rights,
    To herd with vulgar kings and parasites?                           140
    Egypt! from whose all dateless tombs arose
    Forgotten Pharaohs from their long repose,
    And shook within their pyramids to hear
    A new Cambyses thundering in their ear;
    While the dark shades of Forty Ages stood
    Like startled giants by Nile's famous flood[279];
    Or from the Pyramid's tall pinnacle
    Beheld the desert peopled, as from hell,
    With clashing hosts, who strewed the barren sand,
    To re-manure the uncultivated land!                                150
    Spain! which, a moment mindless of the Cid,
    Beheld his banner flouting thy Madrid[280]!
    Austria! which saw thy twice-ta'en capital[281]
    Twice spared to be the traitress of his fall!
    Ye race of Frederic!--Frederics but in name
    And falsehood--heirs to all except his fame:
    Who, crushed at Jena, crouched at Berlin[282], fell
    First, and but rose to follow! Ye who dwell
    Where Kosciusko dwelt, remembering yet
    The unpaid amount of Catherine's bloody debt[283]!                 160
    Poland! o'er which the avenging Angel past,
    But left thee as he found thee,[284] still a waste,
    Forgetting all thy still enduring claim,
    Thy lotted people and extinguished name,
    Thy sigh for freedom, thy long-flowing tear,
    That sound that crashes in the tyrant's ear--
    Kosciusko![285] On--on--on--the thirst of War
    Gasps for the gore of serfs and of their Czar.
    The half barbaric Moscow's minarets
    Gleam in the sun, but 'tis a sun that sets!                        170
    Moscow! thou limit of his long career,
    For which rude Charles had wept his frozen tear[286]
    To see in vain--_he_ saw thee--how? with spire
    And palace fuel to one common fire.
    To this the soldier lent his kindling match,
    To this the peasant gave his cottage thatch,
    To this the merchant flung his hoarded store,
    The prince his hall--and Moscow was no more!
    Sublimest of volcanoes! Etna's flame
    Pales before thine, and quenchless Hecla's tame;                   180
    Vesuvius shows his blaze,[287] an usual sight
    For gaping tourists, from his hackneyed height:[dz]
    Thou stand'st alone unrivalled, till the Fire
    To come, in which all empires shall expire!

      Thou other Element! as strong and stern,
    To teach a lesson conquerors will not learn!--
    Whose icy wing flapped o'er the faltering foe,
    Till fell a hero with each flake of snow;
    How did thy numbing beak and silent fang,
    Pierce, till hosts perished with a single pang!                    190
    In vain shall Seine look up along his banks
    For the gay thousands of his dashing ranks!
    In vain shall France recall beneath her vines
    Her Youth--their blood flows faster than her wines;
    Or stagnant in their human ice remains
    In frozen mummies on the Polar plains.
    In vain will Italy's broad sun awaken
    Her offspring chilled; its beams are now forsaken.
    Of all the trophies gathered from the war,
    What shall return? the Conqueror's broken car![288]                200
    The Conqueror's yet unbroken heart! Again
    The horn of Roland[289] sounds, and not in vain.
    Lutzen, where fell the Swede of victory,[290]
    Beholds him conquer, but, alas! not die:
    Dresden[291] surveys three despots fly once more
    Before their sovereign,--sovereign as before;[ea]
    But there exhausted Fortune quits the field,
    And Leipsic's[292] treason bids the unvanquished yield;
    The Saxon jackal leaves the lion's side
    To turn the bear's, and wolf's, and fox's guide;                   210
    And backward to the den of his despair
    The forest monarch shrinks, but finds no lair!

      Oh ye! and each, and all! Oh France! who found
    Thy long fair fields ploughed up as hostile ground,
    Disputed foot by foot, till Treason, still
    His only victor, from Montmartre's hill[293]
    Looked down o'er trampled Paris! and thou Isle,
    Which seest Etruria from thy ramparts smile,
    Thou momentary shelter of his pride,
    Till wooed by danger, his yet weeping bride!                       220
    Oh, France! retaken by a single march,
    Whose path was through one long triumphal arch!
    Oh bloody and most bootless Waterloo!
    Which proves how fools may have their fortune too,
    Won half by blunder, half by treachery:
    Oh dull Saint Helen! with thy gaoler nigh--
    Hear! hear Prometheus[294] from his rock appeal
    To Earth,--Air,--Ocean,--all that felt or feel
    His power and glory, all who yet shall hear
    A name eternal as the rolling year;                                230
    He teaches them the lesson taught so long,
    So oft, so vainly--learn to do no wrong!
    A single step into the right had made
    This man the Washington of worlds betrayed:
    A single step into the wrong has given
    His name a doubt to all the winds of heaven;
    The reed of Fortune, and of thrones the rod,
    Of Fame the Moloch or the demigod;
    His country's Caesar, Europe's Hannibal,
    Without their decent dignity of fall.                              240
    Yet Vanity herself had better taught
    A surer path even to the fame he sought,
    By pointing out on History's fruitless page
    Ten thousand conquerors for a single sage.
    While Franklin's quiet memory climbs to Heaven,
    Calming the lightning which he thence hath riven,
    Or drawing from the no less kindled earth
    Freedom and peace to that which boasts his birth;[295]
    While Washington's a watchword, such as ne'er
    Shall sink while there's an echo left to air:[296]                 250
    While even the Spaniard's thirst of gold and war
    Forgets Pizarro to shout Bolivar![297]
    Alas! why must the same Atlantic wave
    Which wafted freedom gird a tyrant's grave--
    The king of kings, and yet of slaves the slave,
    Who burst the chains of millions to renew
    The very fetters which his arm broke through,
    And crushed the rights of Europe and his own,
    To flit between a dungeon and a throne?


                    VI.

    But 'twill not be--the spark's awakened--lo!                       260
    The swarthy Spaniard feels his former glow;
    The same high spirit which beat back the Moor
    Through eight long ages of alternate gore
    Revives--and where? in that avenging clime
    Where Spain was once synonymous with crime,
    Where Cortes' and Pizarro's banner flew,
    The infant world redeems her name of "_New_."
    'Tis the _old_ aspiration breathed afresh,
    To kindle souls within degraded flesh,
    Such as repulsed the Persian from the shore                        270
    Where Greece _was_--No! she still is Greece once more.
    One common cause makes myriads of one breast,
    Slaves of the East, or helots of the West:
    On Andes'[298] and on Athos' peaks unfurled,
    The self-same standard streams o'er either world:
    The Athenian[299] wears again Harmodius' sword;
    The Chili chief[300] abjures his foreign lord;
    The Spartan knows himself once more a Greek,[301]
    Young Freedom plumes the crest of each cacique;
    Debating despots, hemmed on either shore,                          280
    Shrink vainly from the roused Atlantic's roar;
    Through Calpe's strait the rolling tides advance,
    Sweep slightly by the half-tamed land of France,
    Dash o'er the old Spaniard's cradle, and would fain
    Unite Ausonia to the mighty main:
    But driven from thence awhile, yet not for aye,
    Break o'er th' AEgean, mindful of the day
    Of Salamis!--there, there the waves arise,
    Not to be lulled by tyrant victories.
    Lone, lost, abandoned in their utmost need                         290
    By Christians, unto whom they gave their creed,
    The desolated lands, the ravaged isle,
    The fostered feud encouraged to beguile,
    The aid evaded, and the cold delay,
    Prolonged but in the hope to make a prey[302];--
    These, these shall tell the tale, and Greece can show
    The false friend worse than the infuriate foe.
    But this is well: Greeks only should free Greece,
    Not the barbarian, with his masque of peace.
    How should the Autocrat of bondage be                              300
    The king of serfs, and set the nations free?
    Better still serve the haughty Mussulman,
    Than swell the Cossaque's prowling caravan;
    Better still toil for masters, than await,
    The slave of slaves, before a Russian gate,--
    Numbered by hordes, a human capital,
    A live estate, existing but for thrall,
    Lotted by thousands, as a meet reward
    For the first courtier in the Czar's regard;
    While their immediate owner never tastes                           310
    His sleep, _sans_ dreaming of Siberia's wastes:
    Better succumb even to their own despair,
    And drive the Camel--than purvey the Bear.


                    VII.

    But not alone within the hoariest clime
    Where Freedom dates her birth with that of Time,
    And not alone where, plunged in night, a crowd
    Of Incas darken to a dubious cloud[eb],
    The dawn revives: renowned, romantic Spain
    Holds back the invader from her soil again.
    Not now the Roman tribe nor Punic horde[ec]                        320
    Demands her fields as lists to prove the sword;
    Not now the Vandal or the Visigoth
    Pollute the plains, alike abhorring both[ed];
    Nor old Pelayo[303] on his mountain rears
    The warlike fathers of a thousand years.
    That seed is sown and reaped, as oft the Moor
    Sighs to remember on his dusky shore.
    Long in the peasant's song or poet's page
    Has dwelt the memory of Abencerrage;
    The Zegri[304], and the captive victors, flung                     330
    Back to the barbarous realm from whence they sprung.
    But these are gone--their faith, their swords, their sway,
    Yet left more anti-christian foes than they[ee];
    The bigot monarch, and the butcher priest[305],
    The Inquisition, with her burning feast,
    The Faith's red "Auto," fed with human fuel,
    While sate the catholic Moloch, calmly cruel,
    Enjoying, with inexorable eye,[ef]
    That fiery festival of Agony!
    The stern or feeble sovereign, one or both                         340
    By turns; the haughtiness whose pride was sloth;
    The long degenerate noble; the debased
    Hidalgo, and the peasant less disgraced,
    But more degraded; the unpeopled realm;
    The once proud navy which forgot the helm;
    The once impervious phalanx disarrayed;
    The idle forge that formed Toledo's blade;
    The foreign wealth that flowed on every shore,
    Save hers who earned it with the native's gore;
    The very language which might vie with Rome's,                     350
    And once was known to nations like their homes,
    Neglected or forgotten:--such _was_ Spain;
    But such she is not, nor shall be again.
    These worst, these _home_ invaders, felt and feel
    The new Numantine soul of old Castile[eg],
    Up! up again! undaunted Tauridor!
    The bull of Phalaris renews his roar[eh];
    Mount, chivalrous Hidalgo! not in vain
    Revive the cry--"Iago! and close Spain!"[306]
    Yes, close her with your armed bosoms round,                       360
    And form the barrier which Napoleon found,--
    The exterminating war, the desert plain,
    The streets without a tenant, save the slain;
    The wild Sierra, with its wilder troop[ei]
    Of vulture-plumed Guerrillas, on the stoop[ej]
    For their incessant prey; the desperate wall
    Of Saragossa, mightiest in her fall;
    The Man nerved to a spirit, and the Maid
    Waving her more than Amazonian blade[307];
    The knife of Arragon, Toledo's steel;                              370
    The famous lance of chivalrous Castile[308];
    The unerring rifle of the Catalan;
    The Andalusian courser in the van;
    The torch to make a Moscow of Madrid;
    And in each heart the spirit of the Cid:--
    Such have been, such shall be, such are. Advance,
    And win--not Spain! but thine own freedom, France!


                    VIII.

    But lo! a Congress[309]! What! that hallowed name
    Which freed the Atlantic! May we hope the same
    For outworn Europe? With the sound arise,                          380
    Like Samuel's shade to Saul's monarchic eyes,
    The prophets of young Freedom, summoned far
    From climes of Washington and Bolivar;
    Henry, the forest-born Demosthenes,
    Whose thunder shook the Philip of the seas[310];
    And stoic Franklin's energetic shade,
    Robed in the lightnings which his hand allayed;
    And Washington, the tyrant-tamer, wake,
    To bid us blush for these old chains, or break.
    But _who_ compose this Senate of the few                           390
    That should redeem the many? _Who_ renew
    This consecrated name, till now assigned
    To councils held to benefit mankind?
    Who now assemble at the holy call?
    The blest Alliance, which says three are all!
    An earthly Trinity! which wears the shape
    Of Heaven's, as man is mimicked by the ape.
    A pious Unity! in purpose one--
    To melt three fools to a Napoleon[ek].
    Why, Egypt's Gods were rational to these;                          400
    Their dogs and oxen knew their own degrees,
    And, quiet in their kennel or their shed,
    Cared little, so that they were duly fed;
    But these, more hungry, must have something more--
    The power to bark and bite, to toss and gore.
    Ah, how much happier were good AEsop's frogs
    Than we! for ours are animated logs,
    With ponderous malice swaying to and fro,
    And crushing nations with a stupid blow;
    All dully anxious to leave little work                             410
    Unto the revolutionary stork.


                    IX.

    Thrice blest Verona! since the holy three
    With their imperial presence shine on thee!
    Honoured by them, thy treacherous site forgets[el]
    The vaunted tomb of "all the Capulets!"[311]
    Thy Scaligers--for what was "Dog the Great,"
    "Can Grande,"[312] (which I venture to translate,)
    To these sublimer pugs? Thy poet too,
    Catullus, whose old laurels yield to new;[313]
    Thine amphitheatre, where Romans sate;                             420
    And Dante's exile sheltered by thy gate;
    Thy good old man, whose world was all within
    Thy wall, nor knew the country held him in;[314]
    Would that the royal guests it girds about
    Were so far like, as never to get out!
    Aye, shout! inscribe![315] rear monuments of shame,
    To tell Oppression that the world is tame!
    Crowd to the theatre with loyal rage,
    The comedy is not upon the stage;
    The show is rich in ribandry and stars,                            430
    Then gaze upon it through thy dungeon bars;
    Clap thy permitted palms, kind Italy,
    For thus much still thy fettered hands are free!


                    X.

    Resplendent sight! Behold the coxcomb Czar,[316]
    The Autocrat of waltzes[317] and of war!
    As eager for a plaudit as a realm,
    And just as fit for flirting as the helm;
    A Calmuck beauty with a Cossack wit,
    And generous spirit, when 'tis not frost-bit;
    Now half dissolving to a liberal thaw,[em]                         440
    But hardened back whene'er the morning's raw;
    With no objection to true Liberty,
    Except that it would make the nations free.
    How well the imperial dandy prates of peace!
    How fain, if Greeks would be his slaves, free Greece!
    How nobly gave he back the Poles their Diet,
    Then told pugnacious Poland to be quiet!
    How kindly would he send the mild Ukraine,
    With all her pleasant Pulks,[318] to lecture Spain!
    How royally show off in proud Madrid                               450
    His goodly person, from the South long hid!
    A blessing cheaply purchased, the world knows,
    By having Muscovites for friends or foes.
    Proceed, thou namesake of great Philip's son!
    La Harpe, thine Aristotle, beckons on;[319]
    And that which Scythia was to him of yore
    Find with thy Scythians on Iberia's shore.
    Yet think upon, thou somewhat aged youth,
    Thy predecessor on the banks of Pruth;
    Thou hast to aid thee, should his lot be thine,                    460
    Many an old woman,[320] but not Catherine.[321]
    Spain, too, hath rocks, and rivers, and defiles--
    The Bear may rush into the Lion's toils.
    Fatal to Goths are Xeres' sunny fields;[322]
    Think'st thou to thee Napoleon's victor yields?
    Better reclaim thy deserts, turn thy swords
    To ploughshares, shave and wash thy Bashkir[323] hordes,
    Redeem thy realms from slavery and the knout,
    Than follow headlong in the fatal route,
    To infest the clime whose skies and laws are pure                  470
    With thy foul legions. Spain wants no manure:
    Her soil is fertile, but she feeds no foe:
    Her vultures, too, were gorged not long ago;
    And wouldst thou furnish them with fresher prey?
    Alas! thou wilt not conquer, but purvey.
    I am Diogenes, though Russ and Hun[324]
    Stand between mine and many a myriad's sun;
    But were I not Diogenes, I'd wander
    Rather a worm than _such_ an Alexander!
    Be slaves who will, the cynic shall be free;                       480
    His tub hath tougher walls than Sinope:[en]
    Still will he hold his lantern up to scan
    The face of monarchs for an "honest man."[325]


                    XI.

    And what doth Gaul, the all-prolific land
    Of _ne plus ultra_ ultras and their band
    Of mercenaries? and her noisy chambers
    And tribune, which each orator first clambers
    Before he finds a voice, and when 'tis found,
    Hears "the lie" echo for his answer round?
    Our British Commons sometimes deign to "hear!" 490
    A Gallic senate hath more tongue than ear;
    Even Constant,[326] their sole master of debate,
    Must fight next day his speech to vindicate.
    But this costs little to true Franks, who'd rather
    Combat than listen, were it to their father.
    What is the simple standing of a shot,
    To listening long, and interrupting not?
    Though this was not the method of old Rome,
    When Tully fulmined o'er each vocal dome,
    Demosthenes has sanctioned the transaction,                        500
    In saying eloquence meant "Action, action!"


                    XII.

    But where's the monarch?[327] hath he dined? or yet
    Groans beneath indigestion's heavy debt?
    Have revolutionary pates risen,
    And turned the royal entrails to a prison?
    Have discontented movements stirred the troops?
    Or have _no_ movements followed traitorous soups?
    Have Carbonaro[328] cooks not carbonadoed
    Each course enough? or doctors dire dissuaded
    Repletion? Ah! in thy dejected looks                               510
    I read all France's treason in her cooks!
    Good classic Louis! is it, canst thou say,
    Desirable to be the "Desire?"
    Why wouldst thou leave calm Hartwell's green abode,
    Apician table, and Horatian ode,
    To rule a people who will not be ruled,
    And love much rather to be scourged than schooled?
    Ah! thine was not the temper or the taste
    For thrones; the table sees thee better placed:
    A mild Epicurean, formed, at best,                                 520
    To be a kind host and as good a guest,
    To talk of Letters, and to know by heart
    One _half_ the Poet's, _all_ the Gourmand's art;
    A scholar always, now and then a wit,
    And gentle when Digestion may permit;--
    But not to govern lands enslaved or free;
    The gout was martyrdom enough for thee.


                    XIII.

    Shall noble Albion pass without a phrase
    From a bold Briton in her wonted praise?
    "Arts--arms--and George--and glory--and the Isles, 530
    And happy Britain, wealth, and Freedom's smiles,
    White cliffs, that held invasion far aloof,
    Contented subjects, all alike tax-proof,
    Proud Wellington, with eagle beak so curled,[eo]
    That nose, the hook where he suspends the world![329]
    And Waterloo, and trade, and----(hush! not yet
    A syllable of imposts or of debt)----
    And ne'er (enough) lamented Castlereagh,[330]
    Whose penknife slit a goose-quill t'other day--[ep]
    And, 'pilots who have weathered every storm'--[331]                540
    (But, no, not even for rhyme's sake, name Reform)."
    These are the themes thus sung so oft before,
    Methinks we need not sing them any more;
    Found in so many volumes far and near,
    There's no occasion you should find them here.
    Yet something may remain perchance to chime
    With reason, and, what's stranger still, with rhyme.[eq]
    Even this thy genius, Canning![332] may permit,
    Who, bred a statesman, still wast born a wit,
    And never, even in that dull House, couldst tame                   550
    To unleavened prose thine own poetic flame;
    Our last, our best, our only orator,
    Even I can praise thee--Tories do no more:
    Nay, not so much;--they hate thee, man, because
    Thy Spirit less upholds them than it awes.
    The hounds will gather to their huntsman's hollo,
    And where he leads the duteous pack will follow;
    But not for love mistake their yelling cry;
    Their yelp for game is not an eulogy;
    Less faithful far than the four-footed pack,                       560
    A dubious scent would lure the bipeds back.
    Thy saddle-girths are not yet quite secure,
    Nor royal stallion's feet extremely sure;
    The unwieldy old white horse is apt at last
    To stumble, kick--and now and then stick fast
    With his great Self and Rider in the mud;
    But what of that? the animal shows blood.


                    XIV.

    Alas, the Country! how shall tongue or pen
    Bewail her now _un_country gentlemen?
    The last to bid the cry of warfare cease,                          570
    The first to make a malady of peace.
    For what were all these country patriots born?
    To hunt--and vote--and raise the price of corn?
    But corn, like every mortal thing, must fall,
    Kings--Conquerors--and markets most of all.
    And must ye fall with every ear of grain?
    Why would you trouble Buonaparte's reign?
    He was your great Triptolemus;[333] his vices
    Destroyed but realms, and still maintained your prices;
    He amplified to every lord's content                               580
    The grand agrarian alchymy, high _rent_.[er]
    Why did the tyrant stumble on the Tartars,
    And lower wheat to such desponding quarters?
    Why did you chain him on yon Isle so lone?
    The man was worth much more upon his throne.
    True, blood and treasure boundlessly were spilt,
    But what of that? the Gaul may bear the guilt;
    But bread was high, the farmer paid his way,
    And acres told upon the appointed day.[es]
    But where is now the goodly audit ale?                             590
    The purse-proud tenant, never known to fail?
    The farm which never yet was left on hand?
    The marsh reclaimed to most improving land?
    The impatient hope of the expiring lease?
    The doubling rental? What an evil's peace!
    In vain the prize excites the ploughman's skill,
    In vain the Commons pass their patriot bill;[334]
    The _Landed Interest_--(you may understand
    The phrase much better leaving out the _land_)--
    The land self-interest groans from shore to shore,                 600
    For fear that plenty should attain the poor.[et]
    Up, up again, ye rents, exalt your notes,
    Or else the Ministry will lose their votes,
    And patriotism, so delicately nice,
    Her loaves will lower to the market price;[eu]
    For ah! "the loaves and fishes," once so high,
    Are gone--their oven closed, their ocean dry,[ev]
    And nought remains of all the millions spent,
    Excepting to grow moderate and content.
    They who are not so, _had_ their turn--and turn                    610
    About still flows from Fortune's equal urn;
    Now let their virtue be its own reward,
    And share the blessings which themselves prepared.
    See these inglorious Cincinnati swarm,
    Farmers of war, dictators of the farm;
    _Their_ ploughshare was the sword in hireling hands,
    _Their_ fields manured by gore of other lands;
    Safe in their barns, these Sabine tillers sent
    Their brethren out to battle--why? for rent!
    Year after year they voted cent. per cent.                         620
    Blood, sweat, and tear-wrung millions--why?--for rent!
    They roared, they dined, they drank, they swore they meant
    To die for England--why then live?--for rent!
    The peace has made one general malcontent
    Of these high-market patriots; war was rent!
    Their love of country, millions all mis-spent,
    How reconcile? by reconciling rent!
    And will they not repay the treasures lent?
    No: down with everything, and up with rent!
    Their good, ill, health, wealth, joy, or discontent,               630
    Being, end, aim, religion--_rent_--_rent_--_rent_!
    Thou sold'st thy birthright, Esau! for a mess;
    Thou shouldst have gotten more, or eaten less;
    Now thou hast swilled thy pottage, thy demands
    Are idle; Israel says the bargain stands.
    Such, landlords! was your appetite for war,
    And gorged with blood, you grumble at a scar!
    What! would they spread their earthquake even o'er cash?
    And when land crumbles, bid firm paper crash?[335]
    So rent may rise, bid Bank and Nation fall,                        640
    And found on 'Change a _Fundling_ Hospital?
    Lo, Mother Church, while all religion writhes,
    Like Niobe, weeps o'er her offspring--Tithes;[336]
    The Prelates go to--where the Saints have gone,
    And proud pluralities subside to one;
    Church, state, and faction wrestle in the dark,
    Tossed by the deluge in their common ark.
    Shorn of her bishops, banks, and dividends,
    Another Babel soars--but Britain ends.
    And why? to pamper the self-seeking wants,                         650
    And prop the hill of these agrarian ants.
    "Go to these ants, thou sluggard, and be wise;"
    Admire their patience through each sacrifice,
    Till taught to feel the lesson of their pride,
    The price of taxes and of homicide;
    Admire their justice, which would fain deny
    The debt of nations:--pray _who made it high?_[337]



                    XV.

    Or turn to sail between those shifting rocks,
    The new Symplegades[338]--the crushing Stocks,
    Where Midas might again his wish behold                            660
    In real paper or imagined gold.
    That magic palace of Alcina[339] shows
    More wealth than Britain ever had to lose,
    Were all her atoms of unleavened ore,
    And all her pebbles from Pactolus' shore.
    There Fortune plays, while Rumour holds the stake
    And the World trembles to bid brokers break.
    How rich is Britain! not indeed in mines,
    Or peace or plenty, corn or oil, or wines;
    No land of Canaan, full of milk and honey,                         670
    Nor (save in paper shekels) ready money:
    But let us not to own the truth refuse,
    Was ever Christian land so rich in Jews?
    Those parted with their teeth to good King John,
    And now, ye kings, they kindly draw your own;
    All states, all things, all sovereigns they control,
    And waft a loan "from Indus to the pole."
    The banker--broker--baron[340]--brethren, speed
    To aid these bankrupt tyrants in their need.
    Nor these alone; Columbia feels no less                            680
    Fresh speculations follow each success;
    And philanthropic Israel deigns to drain
    Her mild per-centage from exhausted Spain.
    Not without Abraham's seed can Russia march;
    Tis gold, not steel, that rears the conqueror's arch.
    Two Jews, a chosen people, can command
    In every realm their Scripture-promised land:--
    Two Jews, keep down the Romans,[341] and uphold
    The accursed Hun, more brutal than of old:
    Two Jews,--but not Samaritans--direct                              690
    The world, with all the spirit of their sect.
    What is the happiness of earth to them?
    A congress forms their "New Jerusalem,"
    Where baronies and orders both invite--
    Oh, holy Abraham! dost thou see the sight?
    Thy followers mingling with these royal swine,
    Who spit not "on their Jewish gaberdine,"
    But honour them as portion of the show--
    (Where now, oh Pope! is thy forsaken toe?
    Could it not favour Judah with some kicks?                         700
    Or has it ceased to "kick against the pricks?")
    On Shylock's shore behold them stand afresh,
    To cut from Nation's hearts their "pound of flesh."


                    XVI.

    Strange sight this Congress! destined to unite
    All that's incongruous, all that's opposite.
    I speak not of the Sovereigns--they're alike,
    A common coin as ever mint could strike;
    But those who sway the puppets, pull the strings,
    Have more of motley than their heavy kings.
    Jews, authors, generals, charlatans, combine,                      710
    While Europe wonders at the vast design:
    There Metternich, power's foremost parasite,
    Cajoles; there Wellington forgets to fight;
    There Chateaubriand[342] forms new books of martyrs;
    And subtle Greeks[343] intrigue for stupid Tartars;
    There Montmorenci, the sworn foe to charters,[344]
    Turns a diplomatist of great eclat,
    To furnish articles for the "Debats;"
    Of war so certain--yet not quite so sure
    As his dismissal in the "Moniteur." 720
    Alas! how could his cabinet thus err!
    Can Peace be worth an ultra-minister?
    He falls indeed, perhaps to rise again,
    "Almost as quickly as he conquered Spain.[345]"


                    XVII.

    Enough of this--a sight more mournful woos
    The averted eye of the reluctant Muse.
    The Imperial daughter, the Imperial bride,[346]
    The imperial Victim--sacrifice to pride;
    The mother of the Hero's hope, the boy,
    The young Astyanax of Modern Troy;[347]                            730
    The still pale shadow of the loftiest Queen
    That Earth has yet to see, or e'er hath seen;
    She flits amidst the phantoms of the hour,
    The theme of pity, and the wreck of power.
    Oh, cruel mockery! Could not Austria spare
    A daughter? What did France's widow there?
    Her fitter place was by St. Helen's wave,
    Her only throne is in Napoleon's grave.
    But, no,--she still must hold a petty reign,
    Flanked by her formidable chamberlain;                             740
    The martial Argus, whose not hundred eyes[348]
    Must watch her through these paltry pageantries.
    What though she share no more, and shared in vain,
    A sway surpassing that of Charlemagne,
    Which swept from Moscow to the southern seas!
    Yet still she rules the pastoral realm of cheese,
    Where Parma views the traveller resort,
    To note the trappings of her mimic court.
    But she appears! Verona sees her shorn
    Of all her beams--while nations gaze and mourn--                   750
    Ere yet her husband's ashes have had time
    To chill in their inhospitable clime;
    (If e'er those awful ashes can grow cold;--
    But no,--their embers soon will burst the mould;)
    She comes!--the Andromache (but not Racine's,
    Nor Homer's,)--Lo! on Pyrrhus' arm[349] she leans![ew]
    Yes! the right arm, yet red from Waterloo,
    Which cut her lord's half-shattered sceptre through,
    Is offered and accepted? Could a slave
    Do more? or less?--and _he_ in his new grave!                      760
    Her eye--her cheek--betray no inward strife,
    And the _Ex_-Empress grows as _Ex_ a wife!
    So much for human ties in royal breasts!
    Why spare men's feelings, when their own are jests?


                    XVIII.

    But, tired of foreign follies, I turn home,
    And sketch the group--the picture's yet to come.
    My Muse 'gan weep, but, ere a tear was spilt,
    She caught Sir William Curtis in a kilt![350]
    While thronged the chiefs of every Highland clan
    To hail their brother, Vich Ian Alderman!                          770
    Guildhall grows Gael, and echoes with Erse roar,
    While all the Common Council cry "Claymore!"[351]
    To see proud Albyn's tartans as a belt
    Gird the gross sirloin of a city Celt,
    She burst into a laughter so extreme,
    That I awoke--and lo! it was _no_ dream!

    Here, reader, will we pause:--if there's no harm in
    This first--you'll have, perhaps, a second "Carmen."

                       B. J^n 10^th^ 1823.

[258] [According to Strabo (_Rerum Geog._, xvii. ed. 1807, ii. 1127),
Ptolemaeus Soter brought Alexander's body back from Babylon, and buried
it in Alexandria, in the spot afterwards known as the _Soma_. There it
lay, in Strabo's time, not in its original body-mask of golden
chase-work, which Ptolemaeus Cocces had stolen, but in a casket of
glass. Great men "turned to pilgrims" to visit Alexander's grave.
Augustus crowned the still life-like body with a golden laurel-wreath,
and scattered flowers over the tomb: Caligula stole the breastplate, and
wore it during his pantomimic triumphs; Septimius Severus buried in the
sarcophagus the writings of the priests, and a clue to the
hieroglyphics. Finally, the sarcophagus and its sacred remains
disappear, and Alexander himself passes into the land of fable and
romance. In 1801 a sarcophagus came into the possession of the English
Army, and was presented by George III. to the British Museum.
Hieroglyphics were as yet undeciphered, and, in 1805, the traveller
Edward Daniel Clarke published a quarto monograph (_The Tomb of
Alexander, etc._), in which he proves, to his own satisfaction, that
"this surprising sarcophagus in one entire block of green Egyptian
_breccia_," had once contained the ashes of Alexander the Great. Byron
knew Clarke, and, no doubt, respected his authority (see letter December
15, 1813, _Letters_, 1898, ii. 308); and, hence, the description of
"Alexander's urn" as "a show." The sarcophagus which has, since 1844,
been assigned to its rightful occupant, Nectanebus II. (Nekht-neb-f), is
a conspicuous object in the Egyptian Gallery of the British Museum. It
is a curious coincidence that in the Ethiopic version of the
Pseudo-Callisthenes, Alexander is said to have been the son of
Nectanebus II., who threw a spell over Olympias, the wife of Philip of
Macedon, and won her love by the exercise of nefarious magic. (See the
_Life and Exploits of Alexander the Great_, by E. A. Wallis Budge,
Litt.D., F.S.A., Keeper of the Egyptian and Assyrian Antiquities in the
British Museum, 1896, i, ix.)]

[259] {543}[Arrian (_Alexand. Anabasis_, vii. i, 4, ed. 1849, p. 165)
says that Alexander would never have rested content with what he had
acquired; "that if he had annexed Europe to Asia, and the British Isles
to Europe, he would have sought out some no-man's-land to conquer." So
insatiable was his ambition, that when the courtly philosopher
Anaxarchus explained to him the theory of the plurality of worlds he
bemoaned himself because as yet he was not master of one. "_Heu me_,
inquit, _miserum, quod ne uno quidem adhuc potitus sum_."--Valerius
Maximus, _De Dictis, etc._, lib. viii. cap. xiv. ex. 2. See, too,
_Juvenal_, x. 168, 169. Burton (_Anatomy of Melancholy_, 1893, i. 64)
denies that this was spoken like a prince, but, as wise Seneca censures
him [on another occasion, however], 'twas _vox iniquissima et
stultissima_, "'twas spoken like a bedlam fool."]

[260] [Compare _Werner_, act iii. sc. I, lines 288, 289, "When he
[Sesostris] went into the temple or the city, his custom was to cause
the horses to be unharnessed out of his chariot, and to yoke four kings
and four princes to the chariot-pole."--Diodori Siculi _Bibl. Hist_.,

[261] {544}[In a speech delivered in the House of Commons, February 17,
1800, "On the continuance of the War with France," Pitt described
Napoleon as the "child and champion of Jacobinism." Coleridge, who was
reporting for the _Morning Post_, took down Pitt's words as "nursling
and champion" (unpublished MS. note-book)--a finer and more original
phrase, but substituted "child" for "nursling" in his "copy." (See
_Letters of S. T. Coleridge_, 1895, i. 327, note i.) The phrase was
much in vogue, _e.g._ "All that survives of Jacobinism in Europe looks
up to him as its 'child and champion.'"-_Quarterly Review_, xvi. 48.]

[262] [O'Meara, under the dates August 19, September 5, September 7, 13,
etc. (see _Napoleon in Exile_, 1888, i. 95, 96, 114, 121, etc.), reports
complaints on the part of Napoleon with regard to the reduction of
expenses suggested or enforced by Sir Hudson Lowe, and gives specimens
of the nature and detail of these reductions. For a refutation of
O'Meara's facts and figures (as given in _Napoleon in Exile_, 1822, ii.
Appendix V.), see the _History of the Captivity of Napoleon_, by William
Forsyth, Q.C., 1853, iii. 121, _sq_.; see, too, _Sir Hudson Lowe and
Napoleon_, by R. C. Seaton, 1898. It is a fact that Sir Hudson Lowe, on
his own responsibility, increased the allowance for the household
expenses of Napoleon and his staff from ?8000 to ?12,000 a year, and it
is also perfectly true that opportunities for complaint were welcomed by
the ex-Emperor and his mimic court. It was _la politique de Longwood_ to
make the worst of everything, on the off-chance that England would get
to hear, and that Radical indignation and Radical sympathy would gild,
perhaps unbar, the eagle's cage. It is true, too, that a large sum of
money was spent on behalf of a prisoner of war whom the stalwarts of the
Tory party would have executed in cold blood. But it is also true that
Napoleon had no need to manufacture complaints, that he was exposed to
unnecessary discomforts, that useless and irritating precautions were
taken to prevent his escape, that the bottles of champagne and madeira,
the fowls and the bundles of wood were counted with an irritating
preciseness, inconsistent with the general scale of expenditure, which
saved a little waste, and covered both principals and agents with
ridicule. It is said that O'Meara, in his published volumes, manipulated
his evidence, and that his own letters give him the lie; but there is a
mass of correspondence, published and unpublished, between him and Sir
Thomas Reade, Sir Hudson Lowe, and Major Gorrequer (see Addit. MSS.
Brit. Mus. 20,145), which remains as it was written, and which testifies
to facts which might have been and were not refuted on the spot and at
the moment. With regard to "disputed rations," the Governor should have
been armed with a crushing answer to any and every complaint. As it was,
he was able to show that champagne was allowed to "Napoleon Buonaparte,"
and that he did not exceed his allowance.]

[263] {545}[In his correspondence with Lord Bathurst, Sir Hudson Lowe
more than once quotes "statements" made by Dr. O'Meara (_vide post_, p.
546). But the surgeon may be William Warden (1777-1849), whose _Letters
written on board His Majesty's Ship the Northumberland, and at St,
Helena_, were published in 1816.]

[264] [Henry, Earl of Bathurst (1762-1834), Secretary for War and the
Colonies, replied to Lord Holland's motion "for papers connected with
the personal treatment of Napoleon Buonaparte at St. Helena," March 18,
1817. _Parl. Deb._, vol. 35, pp. 1137-1166.]

[265] [A bust of Napoleon's son, the Duke of Reichstadt, had been
forwarded to St. Helena. O'Meara (_Napoleon in Exile, etc._, 1822, i. p.
100) says "that it had been in the island fourteen days, during several
of which it was at Plantation House," before it was transferred to
Longwood. Forsyth (_History of Napoleon in Captivity_, 1853, ii. 146)
denies this statement. It was, no doubt, detained on board ship for
inspection, but not at Plantation House.]

[266] [The book in question was _The Substance of some Letters written
by an Englishman in Paris_, 1816 (by J. C. Hobhouse). It was inscribed
"To the Emperor Napoleon." Lowe's excuse was that Hobhouse had submitted
the work to his inspection, and suggested that if the Governor did not
think fit to give it to Napoleon, he might place it in his own library.
(See _Napoleon in Exile_, 1822, i. 85-87; and Forsyth, 1853, i. 193.)]

[dy] _Weep to survey the Tamer of the Great_.--[MS.]

[267] [Lieutenant-General Sir Hudson Lowe, K.C.B. (1769-1844), was the
son of an army surgeon, John Hudson Lowe. His mother was Irish. He was
appointed Governor of St. Helena, August 23, 1815, and landed in the
island April 14, 1816. Byron met him at Lord Holland's, before he sailed
for St. Helena, and was not impressed by his remarks on Napoleon and
Waterloo (_Letters_, 1901, v. 429). He was well-intentioned, honourable,
and, in essentials, humane, but he was arrogant and tactless. The
following sentence, from a letter written by Lowe to O'Meara, October 3,
1816 (Forsyth, i. 318, 319), is characteristic: "With respect to the
instructions I have received, and my manner of making them known, never
having regarded General Bonaparte's opinions in any point whatever as to
_matter_ or _manner_, as an oracle or criterion by which to regulate my
own judgment, I am not disposed to think the less favourably of the
instructions, or my mode of executing them." It must, however, be borne
in mind that this was written some time after Lowe's fifth and last
interview with his captive (Aug. 18, 1816); that Napoleon had abused him
to his face and behind his back, and was not above resorting to paltry
subterfuges in order to defy and exasperate his "paltry gaoler."]

[268] {546}[There is reason to think that "the staring stranger" was the
traveller Captain Basil Hall (1788-1844), who called upon Byron at
Venice (see _Letters_, 1900, iv. 252), but did not see him. His account
of his interview with Napoleon is attached to his narrative of a _Voyage
to Java_, 1840. It is not included in the earlier editions of Hall's
_Voyage to the Corea and the Loochoo Islands_, but is quoted by Scott,
in his _Life of Napoleon_, 1827.]

[269] [Barry Edward O'Meara (1786-1836) began life as assistant-surgeon
to the 62nd Regiment, then stationed in Sicily and Calabria. In 1815 he
was surgeon on board the _Bellerophon_, under Captain F. L. Maitland.
Napoleon took a fancy to him because he could speak Italian, and, as his
own surgeon Mengeaud would not follow him into exile, requested that
O'Meara might accompany him, in the _Northumberland_, to St. Helena. His
position was an ambiguous one. He was to act as Napoleon's medical and,
_quoad hoc_, confidential attendant, but he was not to be subservient to
him or dependent on him. At St. Helena Lowe expected him to be something
between an intermediary and a spy, and, for a time, O'Meara discharged
both functions to the Governor's satisfaction (statements by Dr. O'Meara
are quoted by Lowe in his letter to Lord Bathurst [_Life of Napoleon,
etc._, by Sir W. Scott, 1828, p. 763]). As time went on, the surgeon
yielded to the glamour of Napoleon's influence, and more and more
disliked and resented the necessity of communicating private
conversations to Lowe. He "withheld his confidence," with the result
that the Governor became suspicious, and treated O'Meara with
reprobation and contempt. At length, on July 18, 1818, on a renewed
accusation of "irregularities," Lord Bathurst dismissed him from his
post, and ordered him to quit St. Helena. He returned to England, and,
October 28, 1818, addressed a letter (see Forsyth's _Napoleon, etc._,
iii. 432, 433) to J. W. Croker, the Secretary to the Admiralty, in which
he argued against the justice of his dismissal. One sentence which
asserted that Lowe had dwelt upon the "benefit which would result to
Europe from the death of Napoleon," was seized upon by Croker as
calumnious, and in answer to his remonstrance, O'Meara's name was struck
off the list of naval surgeons. He published, in 1819, a work entitled
_Exposition of some of the Transactions that have taken place at St.
Helena since the appointment of Sir Hudson Lowe as Governor_, which was
afterwards expanded into _Napoleon in Exile, or a Voice from St. Helena_
(2 vols., 1822). The latter work made a great sensation, and passed
through five editions. It was republished in 1888. O'Meara was able, and
generously disposed, but he was not "stiff" (_vide infra_, 489). "He
was," says Lord Rosebery (_Napoleon, The Last Phase_, 1900, p. 31), "the
confidential servant of Napoleon: unknown to Napoleon, he was the
confidential agent of Lowe; and behind both their backs he was the
confidential informant of the British Government.... Testimony from such
a source is ... tainted." Neither men nor angels will disentangle the
wheat from the tares.]

[270] {547}[Buonaparte died the 5th of May, 1821.]

[271] [At the end of vol. ii. of O'Meara's _Voice, etc._ (ed. 5), there
is a statement, signed by Count Montholon, to the effect that he wished
the following inscription to be placed on Napoleon's coffin--

              "Napoleon.

      Ne a Ajaccio le 15 Aout, 1769,
    Mort a Ste. Helene le 5 Mai, 1821;"

but that the Governor said, "that his instructions would not allow him
to sanction any other name being placed on the coffin than that of
'General Bonaparte.'" Lowe would have sanctioned "Napoleon Bonaparte,"
but, on his own admission, _did_ refuse the inscription of the one word
"Napoleon."--Forsyth, iii. 295, 296, note 3.]

[272] {548}[Hall, in his interview with Napoleon at St. Helena,
_Narrative of a Voyage to Java_, 1840, p. 77, testifies that, weeks
before the vessel anchored at St. Helena, August 11, 1817, "the
probability of seeing him [Napoleon] had engrossed the thoughts of every
one on board.... Even those of our number who, from their situation,
could have no chance of seeing him, caught the fever of the moment, and
the most cold and indifferent person on board was roused on the occasion
into unexpected excitement."]

[273] [The Colonne Vendome, erected to commemorate the Battle of
Austerlitz, was inaugurated in 1810.]

[274] [Pompey's, i.e. Diocletian's Pillar stands on a mound near the
Arabian cemetery, about three quarters of a mile from Alexandria,
between the city and Lake Mareotis.]

[275] [Napoleon was buried, May 9, 1821, in a garden in the middle of a
deep ravine, under the shade of two willow trees.]

[276] [Byron took for granted that Napoleon's remains would one day rest
under the dome of the Pantheon, where Mirabeau is buried, and where
cenotaphs have been erected to Voltaire and Rousseau. As it is (since
December 15, 1840) he sleeps under the Dome des Invalides. Above the
entrance are these words, which are taken from his will: "Je desire que
mes cendres reposent sur les bords de la Seine, au milieu de ce peuple
Francais que j'ai tant aime."]

[277] {549} Guesclin died during the siege of a city; it surrendered,
and the keys were brought and laid upon his bier, so that the place
might appear rendered to his ashes. [Bertrand du Guesclin, born 1320,
first distinguished himself in the service of King John II. of France,
in defending Rennes against Henry Duke of Lancaster, 1356-57. He was
made Constable of France in 1370, and died before the walls of
Chateauneuf-de-Randon (Lozere). July 13, 1380. He was buried by the
order of Charles V. in Saint-Denis, hard by the tomb which the king had
built for himself. In _La Vie vaillant Bertran du Guesclin_ [_Chronique,
etc._ (par E. Charriere), 1839, tom. ii. p. 321, lines 22716, _sq._],
the English do not place the keys of the castle on Du Guesclin's bier,
but present them to him as he lies tossing on his death-bed ("a son lit
agite"). So, too, _Histoire de Messire Bertrand du Guesclin_, par Claude
Menard, 1618, 540: "Et Engloiz se accorderent a ce faire. Lors issirent
dudit Chastel, et vindrent a Bertran, et lui presenterent les clefs. Et
ne demora gueres, qu'il getta le souppir de la mort."]

[278] [John of Trocnow, surnamed Zi?ka, or the "One-eyed," was born
circ. 1360, and died while he was besieging a town on the Moravian
border, October 11, 1424. He was the hero of the Hussite or Taborite
crusade (1419-1422), the _malleus Catholicorum_. The story is that on
his death-bed he was asked where he wished to be buried, and replied,
"that it mattered not, that his flesh might be thrown to the vulture and
eagles; but his skin was to be carefully preserved and made into a drum,
to be carried in the front of the battle, that the very sound might
disperse their enemies." Voltaire, in his _Essai sur Les Moeurs et
L'Esprit des Nations_ (cap. lxxiii. s.f. _OEuvres Completes, etc._,
1836, iii. 256), mentions the legend as a fact, "Il ordonna qu' apres sa
mort on fit un tambour de sa peau." Compare _Werner_, act i. sc. I,
lines 693, 694.]

Petersburg, December 9, 1770; and it seems now to be certain that the
first open proposal of a dismemberment of Poland arose in his
conversations with the Empress.... Catherine said to the Prince, 'I will
frighten Turkey and flatter England. It is your business to gain
Austria, that she may lull France to sleep;' and she became at length so
eager, that ... she dipt her finger into ink, and drew with it the lines
of partition on a map of Poland which lay before them."--_Edinburgh

and Fall of Napoleon_, 1893, p. 19), "thrust itself most inconveniently
before him. In early life all his sympathies ... were with the Poles,
and he had regarded the partition of their country as a crime.... As a
very young man liberty was his only religion; but he had now learned to
hate and to fear that term.... He had no desire ... to be the Don
Quixote of Poland by reconstituting it as a kingdom. To fight Russia by
the re-establishment of Polish independence was not, therefore, to be
thought of."]

[285] [The final partition of Poland took place after the Battle of
Maciejowice, October 12, 1794, when "Freedom shrieked when Kosciusko
fell." Tyrants, _e.g._ Napoleon in 1806, and Alexander in 1814 and again
in 1815, approached Kosciusko with respect, and loaded him with flattery
and promises, and then "passed by on the other side."]

[286] [The reference is to Charles's chagrin when the Grand Vizier
allowed the Russians to retire in safety from the banks of the Pruth,
and assented to the Treaty of Jassy, July 21, 1711. Charles, "impatient
for the fight, and to behold the enemy in his power," had ridden above
fifty leagues from Bender to Jassy, swam the Pruth at the risk of his
life, and found that the Czar had marched off in triumph. He contrived
to rip up the Vizier's robe with his spur, "remonta a cheval, et
retourna a Bender le desespoir dans le coeur" (_Histoire de Charles

Wilna_, published in 1816, pp. 133-141. "I hurried out, and arrived at
the Hotel d'Angleterre.... [Warsaw, December 10, 1812]. I saw a small
carriage body placed on a sledge made of four pieces of fir: it had
stood some crashes, and was much damaged.... The ministers joined me in
addressing to him ... wishes for the preservation of his health and the
prosperity of his journey. He replied, 'I never was better; if I carried
the devil with me, I should be all the better for that (_Quand j'aurai
le diable je ne m'en porterai que mieux_).' These were his last words.
He then mounted the humble sledge, which bore Caesar and his fortune, and
disappeared." The passage is quoted in the _Quarterly Review_, October,

Grenada to Venezuela under the name of the Republic of Columbia, and on
the 1st of September he made a solemn entry into Lima. He was greeted
with acclaim, but in accepting the honours which his fellow-citizens
showered upon him, he warned them against the dangers of tyranny.
"Beware," he said, "of a Napoleon or an Iturbide." Byron, at one time,
had a mind to settle in "Bolivar's country" (letter to Ellice, June 12,

engaged single-handed with the whole force of the Ottoman Empire,
etc.... Byron's Grecian bard can no longer exclaim--

    'My country! on thy voiceless shore
    The heroic lay is tuneless now--
    The heroic bosom beats no more.'

"Greece is no longer a 'nation's sepulchre,' the foul abode of slaves,
but the living theatre of the patriot's toils and the hero's
achievements. Her banners once more float on the mountains, and the
battles she has already won show that in every glen and valley, as well
as on

[310] [Patrick Henry, born May 29, 1736, died June 6, 1799, was one of
the leading spirits of the American Revolution. His father, John Henry,
a Scotchman, a cousin of the historian, William Robertson, had acquired
a small property in Virginia. Patrick was not exactly "forest born,"
but, as a child, loved to play truant "in the forest with his gun or
over his angle-rod." He first came into notice as an orator in the
"Parson's Cause," a suit brought by a minister of the Established Church
to recover his salary, which had been fixed at 16,000 lbs. of tobacco.
In his speech he is said to have struck the key-note of the Revolution
by arguing that "a king, by disallowing acts of a salutary nature, from
being the father of his people, degenerates into a tyrant, and forfeits
all right to his subjects' obedience." His famous speech against the
"Stamps Act" was delivered in the House of Burgesses of Virginia, May
29, 1765. One passage, with which, no doubt, Byron was familiar, has
passed into history. "Caesar had his Brutus--Charles the First had his
Cromwell--and George the Third--" Henry was interrupted with a shout of
"Treason! treason!!" but finished the sentence with, and "George the
Third _may profit by their example_. If _this_ be treason, make the most
of it."

Henry was delegate to the first Continental Congress, five times
Governor of Virginia, and was appointed U.S. Senator in 1794.

His contemporaries said that he was "the greatest orator that ever
lived." He seems to have exercised a kind of magical influence over his
hearers, which they could not explain, which charmed and overwhelmed
them, and "has left behind a tradition of bewitching persuasiveness and
almost prophetic sublimity."--See _Life of Patrick Henry_, by William
Wirt, 1845, _passim._]

leaves in it, in a wild and desolate conventual garden, once a cemetery,
now ruined to the very graves. The situation struck me as very

The tombs of the Scaligers are close to the Church of Santa Maria

_Orfanotrofio_, between the Via Cappucini and the Adige. It is not "that
ancient vault where all the kindred of the Capulets lie," which has long

[316] {563}[Alexander I. (Paulowitsch), 1777-1825, succeeded his father
in 1801. He began his reign well. Taxation was diminished, judicial
penalties were remitted, universities were founded and reorganized,
personal servitude was abolished or restricted throughout the empire. At
the height of his power and influence, when he was regarded as the
Liberator of Europe, he granted a Constitution to Poland, based on
liberal if not democratic principles (June 21, 1815). But after a time
he reverted to absolutism. Autocracy at home, a mystical and sentimental
alliance with autocrats abroad, were incompatible with the indulgence of
liberal proclivities. "After the Congresses of Aix-la-Chapelle and
Troppau," writes M. Rambaud (_History of Russia_, 1888, ii. 384), "he
was no longer the same man.... From that time he considered himself the
dupe of his generous ideas ... at Carlsbad, at Laybach, and at Verona,
Alexander was already the leader of the European reaction." But even to
the last he believed that he could run with the hare and hunt with the
hounds. "They may say of me," he exclaimed, "what they will; but I have
lived and shall die republican" (ibid., p. 398).

Alexander was a man of ideas, a sentimentalist, and a _poseur_, but he
had an eye to the main chance. Whatever cause or dynasty suffered, the
Emperor Alexander was still triumphant. Byron's special grudge against
him at this time was due to his vacillation with regard to the cause of
Greek Independence. But he is too contemptuous. There were points in
common between the "Coxcomb Czar" and his satirist; and it is far from
certain that if the twain had changed places Byron might not have proved
just "such an Alexander." In one respect their destiny was alike. The
greatest sorrow of their lives was the death of a natural daughter.]

[319] [Frederic Cesar La Harpe (1754-1838) was appointed by Catherine
II. Governor to the Grand-Dukes Alexander and Constantine. It was from
La Harpe's teaching that Alexander imbibed his liberal ideas. In 1816,
when Byron passed the summer in Switzerland, La Harpe was domiciled at
Lausanne, and it is possible that a meeting took place.]

[320] [Alexander's platonic attachment to the Baronne de Krudener (Barbe
Julie de Wietenhoff), beauty, novelist, _illuminee_, was the source of
amusement rather than scandal. The Baronne, then in her fiftieth year,
was the channel through which Franz Bader's theory or doctrine of the
"Holy Alliance" was conveyed to the enthusiastic and receptive Czar. It
was only a passing whim. Alexander's mysticism was for ornament, not for
use, and, before very long, Egeria and her Muscovite Numa parted
company.]

20, 1711.]

[326] {566} [Constant (Henri Benjamin de Rebecque, 1767-1830) was the
"stormy petrel" of debate in the French Chamber. For instance, in a
discussion on secret service money for the police (July 27, 1822), he
exclaimed, "Vous les representez-vous payant d'une main le salaire du
vol, et tenant peut-etre un crucifix de l'autre?" No wonder that there
were "violens murmures, cris d'indignation a droite." The duel, however,
did not arise out of a speech in the Chamber, but from a letter of June
5, 1822, in _La Quotidienne_, in which the Marquis de Forbin des Issarts
replied to some letters of Constant, which had appeared in the
_Courrier_ and _Constitutionnel_. Constant was lame, and accordingly
both combatants "out ete places a dix petits pas sur des chaises." Both
fired twice, but neither "was a penny the worse." (See _La Grande
Encyclopedie_, art. "Constant;" and, for details, _La Quotidienne_, June
8, 1822. See, too, for "session de 1822," _Opinions el Discours_ de M.

[327] [Louis XVIII. (Louis Stanislas Xavier, 1755-1824) passed several
years of exile in England, at Goswell, Wanstead, and latterly at
Hartwell, near Aylesbury, in Buckinghamshire. When he entered Paris as
king, in May, 1814, he was in his fifty-ninth year, inordinately bulky
and unwieldy--a king _pour rire_. "C'est ce gros goutteux," explained an
_ouvrier_ to a bystander, who had asked, "Which is the king?" Fifteen
mutton cutlets, "sautees au jus," for breakfast; fifteen mutton cutlets
served with a "sauce a la champagne," for dinner; to say nothing of
strawberries, and sweet apple-puffs between meals, made digestion and
locomotion difficult. It was no wonder that he was a martyr to the gout.
But he cared for nature and for books as well as for eating. His
_Lettres d'Artwell_ (Paris, 1830), which profess to be selections from
his correspondence with a friend, give a pleasant picture of the _roi en
exil_. His wife, Louise de Savoie, died November, 1810, and in the
following April he writes (_Lettres_, pp. 70, 71), "Mars a maintenu le
bien d'un hiver fort doux; point encore de goutte; _a brebis tondue,
Dieu measure le vent_. Helas! je l'eprouve bien qu'elle est tondue cette
pauvre brebis!... je me promene dans le jardin, je vois mes rosiers qui
poussent bien; a qui offrirai-je les roses?... Eh bien! je ne voudrais
pas que cette goutte d'absinthe cessat, car pour cela il faudrait
l'oublier. L'oublier! Ah Dieu! Je suis comme les enfans d'Israel qui
disaient: _Super flumina Babylonis ... Sion._ Mais ajoutons tout de
suite: _Si oblitus fuero hit, Jerusalem, oblivioni detur dextera mea_."
In another letter, June 8, 1811, he criticizes some translations of
Horace, and laments that the good Pere Sanadon has confined himself to
the _Opera Expurgata_. Not, he adds, that he would not have excluded one
or two odes, "mais on a impitoyablement sabre des choses delicieuses"
(_Lettres_, p. 98).

To his wit, Chateaubriand testifies (_The Congress, etc._, 1838, i.
262). At the council, when affairs of state were being discussed, the
king "would say in his clear shrill voice, 'I am going to make you
laugh, M. de Chateaubriand.' The other ministers fumed with impatience,
but Chateaubriand laughed, not as a courtier, but as a human being."]

[330] [Robert Stewart, Viscount Castlereagh, afterwards Marquis of
Londonderry (1769-1822), who had been labouring under a "mental
delirium" (Letter of Duke of Wellington, August 9, 1822), committed
suicide by cutting his throat with a penknife (August 12, 1822). He was
the uncompromising and successful opponent of popular causes in Ireland,
Italy, and elsewhere, and, as such, Byron assailed him, alive and dead,
with the bitterest invective. (See, for instance, the "Dedication" to
_Don Juan_, stanzas xi.-xvi., sundry epigrams, and an "Epitaph.") In the
Preface to Cantos VI., VII., VIII., of _Don Juan_, he justifies the
inclusion of a stanza or two on Castlereagh, which had been written
"before his decease," and, again, alludes to his suicide. (For an
estimate of his career and character, see _Letters_, 1900, iv. 108, 109,

IV., who had been offended by Canning's neutral attitude, as a minister,
on the question of the Queen's message (June 7, 1820), and by his avowal
"of an unaltered regard and affection" for that "illustrious personage"
herself. There was, too, the prospect of Catholic Emancipation. In 1821
he had spoken in favour of Plunket's bills, and, the next year (April
30, 1822), he had brought in a bill to remove the disabilities of Roman
Catholic peers from sitting in the House of Lords. If Canning persisted
in his advocacy of Catholic claims, the king's conscience might turn
restive, and urge him to effectual resistance. Hence the warning in
lines 563-567.]

[335] {572}[Peel's bill for the resumption of cash payments (Act 59 Geo.
III. cap. 49) was passed June 14, 1819. The "landed interest" attributed
the fall of prices and the consequent fall of rent to this measure, and
hinted more or less plainly that the fund-holders should share the loss.
They had lent their money when the currency was inflated, and should not
now be paid off in gold.

"But _you_," exclaims Cobbett [Letter to Mr. Western (_Weekly Register_,
November 23, 1822)], "what can induce you to stickle for the Pitt system
[i.e. paper-money]? I will tell you what it is: you loved the _high
prices_, and the domination that they gave you.... Besides this, you
think that the _boroughs can be preserved_ by a return to paper-money,
and along with them the hare-and-pheasant law and justice. You loved the
glorious times of paper-money, and you want them back again. You think
that they could go on for ever.... The bill of 1819 was really a great
relaxation of the Pitt system, and when you are crying out _spoliation_
and _confiscation_, when you are bawling out so lustily about the robbery
committed on you by the fund-holders and the placemen, and are praising
the infernal Pitt system at the same time, ... you say they are
receiving, the fund-vagabonds in particular, _more_ than they ought." It
is evident that Byron's verse is a reverberation of Cobbett's prose.]

1792-1868. In 1821 Austria raised 37-1/2 million guldens through the
firm, and, as an acknowledgment of their services, the Emperor raised
the brothers to the rank of baron, and appointed Baron Nathan Mayer
Consul-General in London, and Baron James to the same post in Paris. In
1822 both Russia (see line 684) and England raised 3-1/2 millions sterling
through the Rothschilds. The "two Jews" (line 686, etc.) are, probably,
the two Consuls-General. In 1822 their honours were new, and some
mocked. There is the story that Talleyrand once presented the Parisian
brother to Montmorenci as _M. le premier Juif_ to _M. le premier Baron
Chretien_; while another tale, parent or offspring of the preceding,
which appeared in _La Quotidienne_, December 21, 1822, testifies to the
fact, not recorded, that a Rothschild was at Verona during the Congress:
"M. de Rotschild, baron et banquier general des gouvernemens absolus,

believed that Capo d'Istria was still in the service of the Czar, but,
according to Allison, his advocacy of his compatriots the Greeks had led
to his withdrawal from the Russian Foreign Office, and prevented his
taking part in the Congress. It was, however, stated in the papers that
he had been summoned, and was on his way to Verona.]

[344] [Jean Mathieu Felicite, Duc de Montmorenci (1766-1826), was, in
his youth, a Jacobin. He proposed, August 4, 1789, to abrogate feudal
rights, and June 15, 1790, to abolish the nobility. He was superseded as
plenipotentiary by Chateaubriand, and on his return to Paris created a
duke. Before the end of the year he was called upon to resign his
portfolio as Minister of Foreign Affairs. The king disliked him, and
there were personal disagreements between him and the Prime Minister, M.
de Villele.

accordance with the Treaty of Paris, she left France April 26, 1814,
renounced the title of Empress, and was created Duchess of Parma,
Placentia, and Guastalla. After Napoleon's death (May 5, 1821). "Proud
Austria's mournful flower" did not long remain a widow, but speedily and
secretly married her chamberlain and gentleman of honour, Count Adam de
Neipperg (_ce polisson_ Neipperg, as Napoleon called him), to whom she
had long been attached. It was supposed that she attended the Congress
of Verona in the interest of her son, the ex-King of Rome, to whom
Napoleon had bequeathed money and heirlooms. She was a solemn stately
personage, _tant soit peu declassee_, and the other potentates whispered
and joked at her expense. Chateaubriand says that when the Duke of
Wellington was bored with the meetings of the Congress, he would while
away the time in the company of the Orsini, who scribbled on the margin
of intercepted French despatches, "Pas pour Mariee." Not for Madame de
Neipperg.]

importance to the "galanterie respectueuse que le duc de Wellington

victorious foe, the King of Prussia, giving "la main a l'archduchesse
Marie-Louise jusqu'a son carrosse" (_Le Constitutionnel_, November 19,
1822). "All the world wondered" what Andromache did, and how she would
fare--_dans ce galere_. It is difficult to explain the allusion to
Pyrrhus. Andromache was the unwilling bride of Pyrrhus or Neoptolemus,
whose father had slain her husband, Hector; Marie Louise the willing
bride of Neipperg, who had certainly fought at Leipsic, but who could
not be said to have given the final blow to Napoleon at Waterloo.
Pyrrhus must stand for the victorious foe, and the right arm on which
the too-forgiving Andromache leant, must have been offered by "the
respectful gallantry" of the Duke of Wellington.]

with him in his gorgeously appointed yacht. When the king visited
Scotland in August, 1822, Curtis followed in his train. On first landing
at Leith, "Sir William Curtis, who had _celtified_ himself on the

                                THE ISLAND

                                    OR,

                          CHRISTIAN AND HIS COMRADES.




                       INTRODUCTION TO _THE ISLAND_

The first canto of _The Island_ was finished January 10, 1823. We know
that Byron was still at work on "the poeshie," January 25 (_Letters_,
1901, vi. 164), and may reasonably conjecture that a somewhat illegible
date affixed to the fourth canto, stands for February 14, 1823. The MS.
had been received in London before April 9 (_ibid_., p. 192); and on
June 26, 1823, _The Island; or, The Adventures of Christian and his
Comrades_, was published by John Hunt.

Byron's "Advertisement," or note, prefixed to _The Island_ contains all
that need be said with regard to the "sources" of the poem.

Two separate works were consulted: (1) _A Narrative of the Mutiny on
board His Majesty's Ship Bounty, and the subsequent Voyage of ... the
Ship's Boat from Tafoa, one of the Friendly Islands, to Timor, a Dutch
Settlement in the East Indies_, written by Lieutenant William Bligh,
1790; and (2) _An Account of the Natives of the Tonga Islands_, Compiled
and Arranged from the Extensive Communications of Mr. William Mariner,
by John Martin, M.D., 1817.

According to George Clinton (_Life and Writings of Lord Byron_, 1824, p.
656), Byron was profoundly impressed by Mariner's report of the scenery
and folklore of the _Friendly Islands_, was "never tired of talking of
it to his friends," and, in order to turn this poetic material to
account, finally bethought him that Bligh's _Narrative_ of the mutiny of
the _Bounty_ would serve as a framework or structure "for an embroidery
of rare device"--the figures and foliage of a tropical pattern. That, at
least, is the substance of Clinton's analysis of the "sources" of _The
Island_, and whether he spoke, or only feigned to speak, with authority,
his criticism is sound and to the point. The story of the mutiny of the
_Bounty_, which is faithfully related in the first canto, is not, as the
second title implies, a prelude to the "Adventures of Christian and his
Comrades," but to a description of "The Island," an Ogygia of the South
Seas.

It must be borne in mind that Byron's acquaintance with the details of
the mutiny of the _Bounty_ was derived exclusively from Bligh's
_Narrative_; that he does not seem to have studied the minutes of the
court-martial on Peter Heywood and the other prisoners (September,
1792), or to have possessed the information that in 1809, and, again, in
1815, the Admiralty received authentic information with regard to the
final settlement of Christian and his comrades on Pitcairn Island.
Articles, however, had appeared in the _Quarterly Review_, February,
1810, vol. iii. pp. 23, 24, and July, 1815, vol. xiii. pp. 376-378,
which contained an extract from the log-book of Captain Mayhew Folger,
of the American ship _Topaz_, dated September 29, 1808, and letters from
Folger (March 1, 1813), and Sir Thomas Staines, October 18, 1814, which
solved the mystery. Moreover, the article of February, 1810, is quoted
in the notes (pp. 313-318) affixed to Miss Mitford's _Christina, the
Maid of the South Seas_, 1811, a poem founded on Bligh's _Narrative_, of
which neither Byron or his reviewers seem to have heard.

But whatever may have been his opportunities of ascertaining the facts
of the case, it is certain (see his note to Canto IV. section vi. line
122) that he did not know what became of Christian, and that whereas in
the first canto he follows the text of Bligh's _Narrative_, in the three
last cantos he draws upon his imagination, turning Tahiti into Toobonai
(Tubuai), and transporting Toobonai from one archipelago to
another--from the Society to the Friendly Islands.

Another and still more surprising feature of _The Island_ is that Byron
accepts, without qualification or reserve, the guilt of the mutineers
and the innocence and worth of Lieutenant Bligh. It is true that by
inheritance he was imbued with the traditions of the service, and from
personal experience understood the necessity of discipline on board
ship; but it may be taken for granted that if he had known that the
sympathy, if not the esteem, of the public had been transferred from
Bligh to Christian, that in the opinion of grave and competent writers,
the guilt of mutiny on the high seas had been almost condoned by the
violence and brutality of the commanding officer, he would have sided
with the oppressed rather than the oppressor. As it is, he takes Bligh
at his own valuation, and carefully abstains from "eulogizing mutiny."
(Letter to L. Hunt, January 25, 1823.)

The story of the "mutiny of the _Bounty_" happened in this wise. In 1787
it occurred to certain West India planters and merchants, resident in
London, that it would benefit the natives, and perhaps themselves, if
the bread-fruit tree, which flourished in Tahiti (the Otaheite of
Captain Cook and Sir Joseph Banks, see _Poetical Works_, 1899, ii. 7,
note 2) and other islands of the South Seas, could be acclimatized in
the West Indies. A petition was addressed to the king, with the result
that a vessel, with a burden of 215 tons, which Banks christened the
_Bounty_, sailed from Spithead December 23, 1787. Lieutenant William
Bligh, who had sailed with Cook in the _Resolution_, acted as commanding
officer, and under him were five midshipmen, a master, two master's
mates, etc.--forty-four persons all told. The _Bounty_ arrived at Tahiti
October 26, 1788, and there for six delightful months the ship's company
tarried, "fleeting the time carelessly, as in the elder world." But
"Scripture saith an ending to all fine things must be," and on April 4,
1789, the _Bounty_, with a cargo of over a thousand bread-fruit trees,
planted in pots, tubs, and boxes (see for plate of the pots, etc., _A
Voyage, etc._, 1792, p. 1), sailed away westward for the Cape of Good
Hope, and the West Indies. All went well at first, but "just before
sun-rising" on Tuesday, April 28, 1789, "the north-westernmost of the
Friendly Islands, called Tofoa, bearing north-east," Fletcher Christian,
who was mate of the watch, assisted by Charles Churchill,
master-at-arms, Alexander Smith (the John Adams of Pitcairn Island), and
Thomas Burkitt, able seamen, seized the captain, tied his hands behind
his back, hauled him out of his berth, and forced him on deck. The
boatswain, William Cole, was ordered to hoist out the ship's launch,
which measured twenty-three feet from stem to stern, and into this open
boat Bligh, together with eighteen of the crew, who were or were
supposed to be on his side, were thrust, on pain of instant death. When
they were in the boat they were "veered round with a rope, and finally
cast adrift." Bligh and his eighteen innocent companions sailed
westward, and, after a voyage of "twelve hundred leagues," during which
they were preserved from death and destruction by the wise ordering and
patient heroism of the commander, safely anchored in Koepang Bay, on the
north-west coast of the Isle of Timor, June 14, 1789. (See Bligh's
_Narrative, etc._, 1790, pp. 11-88; and _The Island_, Canto I. section
ix. lines 169-201.)

The _Bounty_, with the remainder of the crew, twenty-five in number,
"the most able of the ship's company," sailed eastward, first to
Toobooai, or Tubuai, an island to the south of the Society Islands,
thence to Tahiti (June 6), back to Tubuai (June 26), and yet again, to
Tahiti (September 20), where sixteen of the mutineers, including the
midshipman George Stewart (the "Torquil" of _The Island_), were put on
shore. Finally, September 21, 1789, Fletcher Christian, with the
_Bounty_ and eight of her crew, six Tahitian men, and twelve women,
sailed away still further east to unknown shores, and, so it was
believed, disappeared for good and all. Long afterwards it was known
that they had landed on Pitcairn Island, broken up the _Bounty_, and
founded a permanent settlement.

When Bligh returned to England (March 14, 1790), and acquainted the
Government "with the atrocious act of piracy and mutiny" which had been
committed on the high seas, the _Pandora_ frigate, with Captain Edwards,
was despatched to apprehend the mutineers, and bring them back to
England for trial and punishment. The _Pandora_ reached Tahiti March 23,
1791, set sail, with fourteen prisoners, May 8, and was wrecked on the
"Great Barrier Reef" north-east of Queensland, August 29, 1791. Four of
the prisoners, including George Stewart, who had been manacled, and were
confined in "Pandora's box," perished in the wreck, and the remaining
ten were brought back to England, and tried by court-martial. (See _The
Eventful History of the Mutiny, etc._ (by Sir John Barrow), 1831, pp.
205-244.)

The story, which runs through the second, third, and fourth cantos, may
possibly owe some of its details to a vague recollection of incidents
which happened, or were supposed to happen, at Tahiti, in the interval
between the final departure of the _Bounty_, September 21, 1789, and the
arrival of the _Pandora_, March 23, 1791; but, as a whole, it is a work
of fiction.

With the exception of the fifteenth and sixteenth cantos of _Don Juan_,
_The Island_ was the last poem of any importance which Byron lived to
write, and the question naturally suggests itself--Is the new song as
good as the old? Byron answers the question himself. He tells Leigh Hunt
(January 25, 1823) that he hopes the "poem will be a little above the
ordinary run of periodical poesy," and that, though portions of the
Toobonai (_sic_) islanders are "pamby," he intends "to scatter some
_un_common places here and there nevertheless." On the whole, in point
of conception and execution, _The Island_ is weaker and less coherent
than the _Corsair_; but it contains lines and passages (_e.g._ Canto I.
lines 107-124, 133-140; Canto II. lines 272-297; Canto IV. lines 94-188)
which display a finer feeling and a more "exalted wit" than the "purple
patches" of _The Turkish Tales_.

The poetic faculty is somewhat exhausted, but the poetic vision has been
purged and heightened by suffering and self-knowledge.

_The Island_ was reviewed in the _Monthly Review_, July, 1823, E.S.,
vol. 101, pp. 316-319; the _New Monthly Magazine_, N.S., 1823, vol. 8,
pp. 136-141; the _Atlantic Magazine_, April, 1826, vol. 2, pp. 333-337;
in the _Literary Chronicle_, June 21, 1823; and the _Literary Gazette_,
June 21, 1823.

    Her course, and gently made her liquid way;[ex]

    Behind, the South Sea's many an islet shore.

    Dividing darkness from the dawning main;
    The dolphins, not unconscious of the day,
    Swam high, as eager of the coming ray;
    The stars from broader beams began to creep,
    And lift their shining eyelids from the deep;[ey]
    The sail resumed its lately shadowed white,
    And the wind fluttered with a freshening flight;
    The purpling Ocean owns the coming Sun,
    But ere he break--a deed is to be done.

    The gallant Chief[352] within his cabin slept,
    Secure in those by whom the watch was kept:

    The worst was over, and the rest seemed sure,[353]

    Alas! his deck was trod by unwilling feet,
    And wilder hands would hold the vessel's sheet;
    Young hearts, which languished for some sunny isle,
    Where summer years and summer women smile;
    Men without country, who, too long estranged,
    Had found no native home, or found it changed,                      30
    And, half uncivilised, preferred the cave
    Of some soft savage to the uncertain wave--
    The gushing fruits that nature gave unfilled;
    The wood without a path--but where they willed;
    The field o'er which promiscuous Plenty poured
    Her horn; the equal land without a lord;
    The wish--which ages have not yet subdued
    In man--to have no master save his mood;[354]
    The earth, whose mine was on its face, unsold,
    The glowing sun and produce all its gold;                           40
    The Freedom which can call each grot a home;
    The general garden, where all steps may roam,
    Where Nature owns a nation as her child,
    Exulting in the enjoyment of the wild;[ez]
    Their shells, their fruits, the only wealth they know,
    Their unexploring navy, the canoe;[fa]
    Their sport, the dashing breakers and the chase;
    Their strangest sight, an European face:--
    Such was the country which these strangers yearned
    To see again--a sight they dearly earned.                           50


                    III.

    Awake, bold Bligh! the foe is at the gate!
    Awake! awake!----Alas! it is too late!
    Fiercely beside thy cot the mutineer
    Stands, and proclaims the reign of rage and fear.
    Thy limbs are bound, the bayonet at thy breast;
    The hands, which trembled at thy voice, arrest;
    Dragged o'er the deck, no more at thy command
    The obedient helm shall veer, the sail expand;
    That savage Spirit, which would lull by wrath
    Its desperate escape from Duty's path,                              60
    Glares round thee, in the scarce believing eyes
    Of those who fear the Chief they sacrifice:
    For ne'er can Man his conscience all assuage,
    Unless he drain the wine of Passion--Rage.


                    IV.

    In vain, not silenced by the eye of Death,
    Thou call'st the loyal with thy menaced breath:--
    They come not; they are few, and, overawed,
    Must acquiesce, while sterner hearts applaud.
    In vain thou dost demand the cause: a curse
    Is all the answer, with the threat of worse.                        70
    Full in thine eyes is waved the glittering blade,
    Close to thy throat the pointed bayonet laid.
    The levelled muskets circle round thy breast
    In hands as steeled to do the deadly rest.
    Thou dar'st them to their worst, exclaiming--"Fire!"
    But they who pitied not could yet admire;
    Some lurking remnant of their former awe
    Restrained them longer than their broken law;
    They would not dip their souls at once in blood,
    But left thee to the mercies of the flood.[355]                     80


                    V.

    "Hoist out the boat!" was now the leader's cry;
    And who dare answer "No!" to Mutiny,
    In the first dawning of the drunken hour,
    The Saturnalia of unhoped-for power?
    The boat is lowered with all the haste of hate,
    With its slight plank between thee and thy fate;
    Her only cargo such a scant supply
    As promises the death their hands deny;
    And just enough of water and of bread
    To keep, some days, the dying from the dead:                        90
    Some cordage, canvass, sails, and lines, and twine,
    But treasures all to hermits of the brine,
    Were added after, to the earnest prayer
    Of those who saw no hope, save sea and air;
    And last, that trembling vassal of the Pole--
    The feeling compass--Navigation's soul.[356]


                    VI.

    And now the self-elected Chief finds time
    To stun the first sensation of his crime,
    And raise it in his followers--"Ho! the bowl!"[357]
    Lest passion should return to reason's shoal.[fb]                  100
    "Brandy for heroes!"[358] Burke could once exclaim--
    No doubt a liquid path to Epic fame;
    And such the new-born heroes found it here,
    And drained the draught with an applauding cheer.
    "Huzza! for Otaheite!"[359] was the cry.
    How strange such shouts from sons of Mutiny!
    The gentle island, and the genial soil,
    The friendly hearts, the feasts without a toil,
    The courteous manners but from nature caught,
    The wealth unhoarded, and the love unbought;                       110
    Could these have charms for rudest sea-boys, driven
    Before the mast by every wind of heaven?
    And now, even now prepared with others' woes
    To earn mild Virtue's vain desire, repose?
    Alas! such is our nature! all but aim
    At the same end by pathways not the same;
    Our means--our birth--our nation, and our name,
    Our fortune--temper--even our outward frame,
    Are far more potent o'er our yielding clay
    Than aught we know beyond our little day.                          120
    Yet still there whispers the small voice within,
    Heard through Gain's silence, and o'er Glory's din:
    Whatever creed be taught, or land be trod,
    Man's conscience is the Oracle of God.[360]


                    VII.

    The launch is crowded with the faithful few
    Who wait their Chief, a melancholy crew:
    But some remained reluctant on the deck
    Of that proud vessel--now a moral wreck--
    And viewed their Captain's fate with piteous eyes;
    While others scoffed his augured miseries,                         130
    Sneered at the prospect of his pigmy sail,
    And the slight bark so laden and so frail.
    The tender nautilus, who steers his prow,
    The sea-born sailor of his shell canoe,
    The ocean Mab, the fairy of the sea,
    Seems far less fragile, and, alas! more free.
    He, when the lightning-winged Tornados sweep
    The surge, is safe--his port is in the deep--
    And triumphs o'er the armadas of Mankind,
    Which shake the World, yet crumble in the wind.                    140


                    VIII.

    When all was now prepared, the vessel clear
    Which hailed her master in the mutineer,
    A seaman, less obdurate than his mates,
    Showed the vain pity which but irritates;
    Watched his late Chieftain with exploring eye,
    And told, in signs, repentant sympathy;
    Held the moist shaddock to his parched mouth,
    Which felt Exhaustion's deep and bitter drouth.
    But soon observed, this guardian was withdrawn,
    Nor further Mercy clouds Rebellion's dawn.[361]                    150
    Then forward stepped the bold and froward boy
    His Chief had cherished only to destroy,
    And, pointing to the helpless prow beneath,
    Exclaimed, "Depart at once! delay is death!"
    Yet then, even then, his feelings ceased not all:
    In that last moment could a word recall
    Remorse for the black deed as yet half done,
    And what he hid from many showed to one:
    When Bligh in stern reproach demanded where
    Was now his grateful sense of former care?                         160
    Where all his hopes to see his name aspire,
    And blazon Britain's thousand glories higher?
    His feverish lips thus broke their gloomy spell,
    "Tis that! 'tis that! I am in hell! in hell!"[362]
    No more he said; but urging to the bark
    His Chief, commits him to his fragile ark;
    These the sole accents from his tongue that fell,
    But volumes lurked below his fierce farewell.



                    IX.

    The arctic[363] Sun rose broad above the wave;
    The breeze now sank, now whispered from his cave;                  170
    As on the AEolian harp, his fitful wings
    Now swelled, now fluttered o'er his Ocean strings.[fc]
    With slow, despairing oar, the abandoned skiff
    Ploughs its drear progress to the scarce seen cliff,
    Which lifts its peak a cloud above the main:
    _That_ boat and ship shall never meet again!

    But 'tis not mine to tell their tale of grief,
    Their constant peril, and their scant relief;
    Their days of danger, and their nights of pain;
    Their manly courage even when deemed in vain;                      180
    The sapping famine, rendering scarce a son
    Known to his mother in the skeleton;[364]
    The ills that lessened still their little store,
    And starved even Hunger till he wrung no more;
    The varying frowns and favours of the deep,
    That now almost ingulfs, then leaves to creep
    With crazy oar and shattered strength along
    The tide that yields reluctant to the strong;
    The incessant fever of that arid thirst[365]
    Which welcomes, as a well, the clouds that burst                   190
    Above their naked bones, and feels delight
    In the cold drenching of the stormy night,
    And from the outspread canvass gladly wrings
    A drop to moisten Life's all-gasping springs;
    The savage foe escaped, to seek again
    More hospitable shelter from the main;
    The ghastly Spectres which were doomed at last
    To tell as true a tale of dangers past,
    As ever the dark annals of the deep
    Disclosed for man to dread or woman weep.                          200


                    X.

    We leave them to their fate, but not unknown
    Nor unredressed. Revenge may have her own:[fd]
    Roused Discipline aloud proclaims their cause,
    And injured Navies urge their broken laws.
    Pursue we on his track the mutineer,
    Whom distant vengeance had not taught to fear.
    Wide o'er the wave--away! away! away!
    Once more his eyes shall hail the welcome bay;
    Once more the happy shores without a law
    Receive the outlaws whom they lately saw;                          210
    Nature, and Nature's goddess--Woman--woos
    To lands where, save their conscience, none accuse;
    Where all partake the earth without dispute,[fe]
    And bread itself is gathered as a fruit;[366]
    Where none contest the fields, the woods, the streams:--
    The goldless Age, where Gold disturbs no dreams,
    Inhabits or inhabited the shore,
    Till Europe taught them better than before;
    Bestowed her customs, and amended theirs,
    But left her vices also to their heirs.[367]                       220
    Away with this! behold them as they were,
    Do good with Nature, or with Nature err.
    "Huzza! for Otaheite!" was the cry,
    As stately swept the gallant vessel by.
    The breeze springs up; the lately flapping sail
    Extends its arch before the growing gale;
    In swifter ripples stream aside the seas,
    Which her bold bow flings off with dashing ease.
    Thus Argo ploughed the Euxine's virgin foam,[ff]
    But those she wafted still looked back to home;                    230
    These spurn their country with their rebel bark,
    And fly her as the raven fled the Ark;
    And yet they seek to nestle with the dove,
    And tame their fiery spirits down to Love.

                        End of Canto 1^st^, J^n 14.




                            CANTO THE SECOND.


                    I.

    How pleasant were the songs of Toobonai,[368]
    When Summer's Sun went down the coral bay!
    Come, let us to the islet's softest shade,
    And hear the warbling birds! the damsels said:
    The wood-dove from the forest depth shall coo,
    Like voices of the Gods from Bolotoo;[369]
    We'll cull the flowers that grow above the dead,
    For these most bloom where rests the warrior's head;
    And we will sit in Twilight's face, and see
    The sweet Moon glancing through the Tooa[370] tree,                 10
    The lofty accents of whose sighing bough
    Shall sadly please us as we lean below;
    Or climb the steep, and view the surf in vain
    Wrestle with rocky giants o'er the main,
    Which spurn in columns back the baffled spray.
    How beautiful are these! how happy they,
    Who, from the toil and tumult of their lives,
    Steal to look down where nought but Ocean strives!
    Even He too loves at times the blue lagoon,
    And smooths his ruffled mane beneath the Moon.                      20


                    II.

    Yes--from the sepulchre we'll gather flowers,
    Then feast like spirits in their promised bowers,
    Then plunge and revel in the rolling surf,
    Then lay our limbs along the tender turf,
    And, wet and shining from the sportive toil,
    Anoint our bodies with the fragrant oil,
    And plait our garlands gathered from the grave,
    And wear the wreaths that sprung from out the brave.
    But lo! night comes, the Mooa[371] woos us back,
    The sound of mats[372] are heard along our track;                   30
    Anon the torchlight dance shall fling its sheen
    In flashing mazes o'er the Marly's[373] green;
    And we too will be there; we too recall
    The memory bright with many a festival,
    Ere Fiji blew the shell of war, when foes
    For the first time were wafted in canoes.[fg]
    Alas! for them the flower of manhood bleeds;
    Alas! for them our fields are rank with weeds:
    Forgotten is the rapture, or unknown,[fh]
    Of wandering with the Moon and Love alone.                          40
    But be it so:--_they_ taught us how to wield
    The club, and rain our arrows o'er the field:
    Now let them reap the harvest of their art!
    But feast to-night! to-morrow we depart.
    Strike up the dance! the Cava bowl[374] fill high!
    Drain every drop!--to-morrow we may die.
    In summer garments be our limbs arrayed;
    Around our waists the Tappa's white displayed;
    Thick wreaths shall form our coronal,[375] like Spring's,
    And round our necks shall glance the Hooni strings;                 50
    So shall their brighter hues contrast the glow
    Of the dusk bosoms that beat high below.


                    III.

    But now the dance is o'er--yet stay awhile;
    Ah, pause! nor yet put out the social smile.
    To-morrow for the Mooa we depart,
    But not to-night--to-night is for the heart.
    Again bestow the wreaths we gently woo,
    Ye young Enchantresses of gay Licoo![376]
    How lovely are your forms! how every sense
    Bows to your beauties, softened, but intense,[fi]                   60
    Like to the flowers on Mataloco's steep,
    Which fling their fragrance far athwart the deep!--
    We too will see Licoo; but--oh! my heart!--
    What do I say?--to-morrow we depart!


                    IV.

    Thus rose a song--the harmony of times
    Before the winds blew Europe o'er these climes.
    True, they had vices--such are Nature's growth--
    But only the barbarian's--we have both;
    The sordor of civilisation, mixed
    With all the savage which Man's fall hath fixed.                    70
    Who hath not seen Dissimulation's reign,
    The prayers of Abel linked to deeds of Cain?
    Who such would see may from his lattice view
    The Old World more degraded than the New,--
    Now _new_ no more, save where Columbia rears
    Twin giants, born by Freedom to her spheres,
    Where Chimborazo, over air,--earth,--wave,--
    Glares with his Titan eye, and sees no slave.[fj][377]


                    V.

    Such was this ditty of Tradition's days,
    Which to the dead a lingering fame conveys                          80
    In song, where Fame as yet hath left no sign
    Beyond the sound whose charm is half divine;
    Which leaves no record to the sceptic eye,
    But yields young History all to Harmony;
    A boy Achilles, with the Centaur's lyre
    In hand, to teach him to surpass his sire.
    For one long-cherished ballad's[378] simple stave,
    Rung from the rock, or mingled with the wave,
    Or from the bubbling streamlet's grassy side,
    Or gathering mountain echoes as they glide,                         90
    Hath greater power o'er each true heart and ear,
    Than all the columns Conquest's minions rear;[fk]
    Invites, when Hieroglyphics[379] are a theme
    For sages' labours, or the student's dream;
    Attracts, when History's volumes are a toil,--
    The first, the freshest bud of Feeling's soil.
    Such was this rude rhyme--rhyme is of the rude--
    But such inspired the Norseman's solitude,
    Who came and conquered; such, wherever rise
    Lands which no foes destroy or civilise,                           100
    Exist: and what can our accomplished art
    Of verse do more than reach the awakened heart?[380]


                    VI.

    And sweetly now those untaught melodies
    Broke the luxurious silence of the skies,
    The sweet siesta of a summer day,
    The tropic afternoon of Toobonai,
    When every flower was bloom, and air was balm,
    And the first breath began to stir the palm,
    The first yet voiceless wind to urge the wave
    All gently to refresh the thirsty cave,                            110
    Where sat the Songstress with the stranger boy,
    Who taught her Passion's desolating joy,
    Too powerful over every heart, but most
    O'er those who know not how it may be lost;
    O'er those who, burning in the new-born fire,
    Like martyrs revel in their funeral pyre,
    With such devotion to their ecstacy,
    That Life knows no such rapture as to die:
    And die they do; for earthly life has nought
    Matched with that burst of Nature, even in thought;                120
    And all our dreams of better life above
    But close in one eternal gush of Love.


                    VII.

    There sat the gentle savage of the wild,
    In growth a woman, though in years a child,
    As childhood dates within our colder clime,
    Where nought is ripened rapidly save crime;
    The infant of an infant world, as pure
    From Nature--lovely, warm, and premature;
    Dusky like night, but night with all her stars;
    Or cavern sparkling with its native spars;                         130
    With eyes that were a language and a spell,
    A form like Aphrodite's in her shell,
    With all her loves around her on the deep,
    Voluptuous as the first approach of sleep;
    Yet full of life--for through her tropic cheek
    The blush would make its way, and all but speak;
    The sun-born blood suffused her neck, and threw
    O'er her clear nut-brown skin a lucid hue,
    Like coral reddening through the darkened wave,
    Which draws the diver to the crimson cave.                         140
    Such was this daughter of the southern seas,
    Herself a billow in her energies,[fl]
    To bear the bark of others' happiness,
    Nor feel a sorrow till their joy grew less:
    Her wild and warm yet faithful bosom knew
    No joy like what it gave; her hopes ne'er drew
    Aught from Experience, that chill touchstone, whose
    Sad proof reduces all things from their hues:
    She feared no ill, because she knew it not,
    Or what she knew was soon--too soon--forgot:                       150
    Her smiles and tears had passed, as light winds pass
    O'er lakes to ruffle, not destroy, their glass,
    Whose depths unsearched, and fountains from the hill,
    Restore their surface, in itself so still,
    Until the Earthquake tear the Naiad's cave,
    Root up the spring, and trample on the wave,
    And crush the living waters to a mass,
    The amphibious desert of the dank morass!
    And must their fate be hers? The eternal change
    But grasps Humanity with quicker range;                            160
    And they who fall but fall as worlds will fall,
    To rise, if just, a Spirit o'er them all.


                    VIII.

    And who is he? the blue-eyed northern child[381]
    Of isles more known to man, but scarce less wild;
    The fair-haired offspring of the Hebrides,
    Where roars the Pentland with its whirling seas;
    Rocked in his cradle by the roaring wind,
    The tempest-born in body and in mind,
    His young eyes opening on the ocean-foam,
    Had from that moment deemed the deep his home,                     170
    The giant comrade of his pensive moods,
    The sharer of his craggy solitudes,
    The only Mentor of his youth, where'er
    His bark was borne; the sport of wave and air;
    A careless thing, who placed his choice in chance,
    Nursed by the legends of his land's romance;
    Eager to hope, but not less firm to bear,
    Acquainted with all feelings save despair.
    Placed in the Arab's clime he would have been
    As bold a rover as the sands have seen,                            180
    And braved their thirst with as enduring lip
    As Ishmael, wafted on his Desert-Ship;[382]
    Fixed upon Chili's shore, a proud cacique:
    On Hellas' mountains, a rebellious Greek;[383]
    Born in a tent, perhaps a Tamerlane;
    Bred to a throne, perhaps unfit to reign.
    For the same soul that rends its path to sway,
    If reared to such, can find no further prey
    Beyond itself, and must retrace its way,[384]
    Plunging for pleasure into pain: the same                          190
    Spirit which made a Nero, Rome's worst shame,
    A humbler state and discipline of heart,
    Had formed his glorious namesake's counterpart;[385]
    But grant his vices, grant them all his own,
    How small their theatre without a throne!


                    IX.

    Thou smilest:--these comparisons seem high
    To those who scan all things with dazzled eye;
    Linked with the unknown name of one whose doom
    Has nought to do with glory or with Rome,
    With Chili, Hellas, or with Araby;--                               200
    Thou smilest?--Smile; 'tis better thus than sigh;
    Yet such he might have been; he was a man,
    A soaring spirit, ever in the van,
    A patriot hero or despotic chief,[fm]
    To form a nation's glory or its grief,
    Born under auspices which make us more
    Or less than we delight to ponder o'er.
    But these are visions; say, what was he here?
    A blooming boy, a truant mutineer.
    The fair-haired Torquil, free as Ocean's spray,                    210
    The husband of the bride of Toobonai.


                    X.

    By Neuha's side he sate, and watched the waters,--
    Neuha, the sun-flower of the island daughters,
    Highborn, (a birth at which the herald smiles,
    Without a scutcheon for these secret isles,)
    Of a long race, the valiant and the free,
    The naked knights of savage chivalry,
    Whose grassy cairns ascend along the shore;
    And thine--I've seen--Achilles! do no more.[386]
    She, when the thunder-bearing strangers came,                      220
    In vast canoes, begirt with bolts of flame,
    Topped with tall trees, which, loftier than the palm,
    Seemed rooted in the deep amidst its calm:
    But when the winds awakened, shot forth wings
    Broad as the cloud along the horizon flings,
    And swayed the waves, like cities of the sea,
    Making the very billows look less free;--
    She, with her paddling oar and dancing prow,
    Shot through the surf, like reindeer through the snow,
    Swift-gliding o'er the breaker's whitening edge,                   230
    Light as a Nereid in her ocean sledge,
    And gazed and wondered at the giant hulk,
    Which heaved from wave to wave its trampling bulk.
    The anchor dropped; it lay along the deep,
    Like a huge lion in the sun asleep,
    While round it swarmed the Proas' flitting chain,
    Like summer bees that hum around his mane.


                    XI.

    The white man landed!--need the rest be told?
    The New World stretched its dusk hand to the Old;
    Each was to each a marvel, and the tie                             240
    Of wonder warmed to better sympathy.
    Kind was the welcome of the sun-born sires,
    And kinder still their daughters' gentler fires.
    Their union grew: the children of the storm
    Found beauty linked with many a dusky form;
    While these in turn admired the paler glow,
    Which seemed so white in climes that knew no snow.
    The chace, the race, the liberty to roam,
    The soil where every cottage showed a home;
    The sea-spread net, the lightly launched canoe,                    250
    Which stemmed the studded archipelago,
    O'er whose blue bosom rose the starry isles;
    The healthy slumber, earned by sportive toils;
    The palm, the loftiest Dryad of the woods,
    Within whose bosom infant Bacchus broods,
    While eagles scarce build higher than the crest
    Which shadows o'er the vineyard in her breast;
    The Cava feast, the Yam, the Cocoa's root,
    Which bears at once the cup, and milk, and fruit;
    The Bread-tree, which, without the ploughshare, yields             260
    The unreaped harvest of unfurrowed fields,
    And bakes its unadulterated loaves
    Without a furnace in unpurchased groves,
    And flings off famine from its fertile breast,
    A priceless market for the gathering guest;--
    These, with the luxuries of seas and woods,
    The airy joys of social solitudes,
    Tamed each rude wanderer to the sympathies
    Of those who were more happy, if less wise,
    Did more than Europe's discipline had done,                        270
    And civilised Civilisation's son!


                    XII.

    Of these, and there was many a willing pair,
    Neuha[387] and Torquil were not the least fair:
    Both children of the isles, though distant far;
    Both born beneath a sea-presiding star;
    Both nourished amidst Nature's native scenes,
    Loved to the last, whatever intervenes
    Between us and our Childhood's sympathy,
    Which still reverts to what first caught the eye.
    He who first met the Highlands' swelling blue                      280
    Will love each peak that shows a kindred hue,
    Hail in each crag a friend's familiar face,
    And clasp the mountain in his Mind's embrace.
    Long have I roamed through lands which are not mine,
    Adored the Alp, and loved the Apennine,
    Revered Parnassus, and beheld the steep
    Jove's Ida and Olympus crown the deep:
    But 'twas not all long ages' lore, nor all
    _Their_ nature held me in their thrilling thrall;
    The infant rapture still survived the boy,                         290
    And Loch-na-gar with Ida looked o'er Troy,[388]
    Mixed Celtic memories with the Phrygian mount,
    And Highland linns with Castalie's clear fount.
    Forgive me, Homer's universal shade!
    Forgive me, Phoebus! that my fancy strayed;
    The North and Nature taught me to adore
    Your scenes sublime, from those beloved before.


                    XIII.

    The love which maketh all things fond and fair,
    The youth which makes one rainbow of the air,
    The dangers past, that make even Man enjoy                         300
    The pause in which he ceases to destroy,
    The mutual beauty, which the sternest feel
    Strike to their hearts like lightning to the steel,
    United the half savage and the whole,
    The maid and boy, in one absorbing soul.
    No more the thundering memory of the fight
    Wrapped his weaned bosom in its dark delight;
    No more the irksome restlessness of Rest
    Disturbed him like the eagle in her nest,
    Whose whetted beak[389] and far-pervading eye                      310
    Darts for a victim over all the sky:
    His heart was tamed to that voluptuous state,
    At once Elysian and effeminate,
    Which leaves no laurels o'er the Hero's urn;--
    These wither when for aught save blood they burn;
    Yet when their ashes in their nook are laid,
    Doth not the myrtle leave as sweet a shade?
    Had Caesar known but Cleopatra's kiss,
    Rome had been free, the world had not been his.
    And what have Caesar's deeds and Caesar's fame                       320
    Done for the earth? We feel them in our shame.
    The gory sanction of his Glory stains
    The rust which tyrants cherish on our chains.
    Though Glory--Nature--Reason--Freedom, bid
    Roused millions do what single Brutus did--
    Sweep these mere mock-birds of the Despot's song
    From the tall bough where they have perched so long,--
    Still are we hawked at by such mousing owls,[390]
    And take for falcons those ignoble fowls,
    When but a word of freedom would dispel                            330
    These bugbears, as their terrors show too well.


                    XIV.

    Rapt in the fond forgetfulness of life,
    Neuha, the South Sea girl, was all a wife,
    With no distracting world to call her off
    From Love; with no Society to scoff
    At the new transient flame; no babbling crowd
    Of coxcombry in admiration loud,
    Or with adulterous whisper to alloy
    Her duty, and her glory, and her joy:
    With faith and feelings naked as her form,                         340
    She stood as stands a rainbow in a storm,
    Changing its hues with bright variety,
    But still expanding lovelier o'er the sky,
    Howe'er its arch may swell, its colours move,
    The cloud-compelling harbinger of Love.


                    XV.

    Here, in this grotto of the wave-worn shore,
    They passed the Tropic's red meridian o'er;
    Nor long the hours--they never paused o'er time,
    Unbroken by the clock's funereal chime,[391]
    Which deals the daily pittance of our span,                        350
    And points and mocks with iron laugh at man.[fn]
    What deemed they of the future or the past?
    The present, like a tyrant, held them fast:
    Their hour-glass was the sea-sand, and the tide,
    Like her smooth billow, saw their moments glide
    Their clock the Sun, in his unbounded tower
    They reckoned not, whose day was but an hour;
    The nightingale, their only vesper-bell,
    Sung sweetly to the rose the day's farewell;[392]
    The broad Sun set, but not with lingering sweep,                   360
    As in the North he mellows o'er the deep;
    But fiery, full, and fierce, as if he left
    The World for ever, earth of light bereft,
    Plunged with red forehead down along the wave,
    As dives a hero headlong to his grave.
    Then rose they, looking first along the skies,
    And then for light into each other's eyes,
    Wondering that Summer showed so brief a sun,
    And asking if indeed the day were done.


                    XVI.

    And let not this seem strange: the devotee                         370
    Lives not in earth, but in his ecstasy;
    Around him days and worlds are heedless driven,
    His Soul is gone before his dust to Heaven.
    Is Love less potent? No--his path is trod,
    Alike uplifted gloriously to God;
    Or linked to all we know of Heaven below,
    The other better self, whose joy or woe
    Is more than ours; the all-absorbing flame
    Which, kindled by another, grows the same,[fo]
    Wrapt in one blaze; the pure, yet funeral pile,                    380
    Where gentle hearts, like Bramins, sit and smile.
    How often we forget all time, when lone,
    Admiring Nature's universal throne,
    Her woods--her wilds--her waters--the intense
    Reply of _hers_ to our intelligence!
    Live not the Stars and Mountains? Are the Waves
    Without a spirit? Are the dropping caves
    Without a feeling in their silent tears?[393]
    No, no;--they woo and clasp us to their spheres,
    Dissolve this clog and clod of clay before                         390
    Its hour, and merge our soul in the great shore.
    Strip off this fond and false identity!--
    Who thinks of self when gazing on the sky?
    And who, though gazing lower, ever thought,
    In the young moments ere the heart is taught
    Time's lesson, of Man's baseness or his own?
    All Nature is his realm, and Love his throne.


                    XVII.

    Neuha arose, and Torquil: Twilight's hour
    Came sad and softly to their rocky bower,
    Which, kindling by degrees its dewy spars,                         400
    Echoed their dim light to the mustering stars.
    Slowly the pair, partaking Nature's calm,
    Sought out their cottage, built beneath the palm;
    Now smiling and now silent, as the scene;
    Lovely as Love--the Spirit!--when serene.
    The Ocean scarce spoke louder with his swell,
    Than breathes his mimic murmurer in the shell,[394]
    As, far divided from his parent deep,
    The sea-born infant cries, and will not sleep,
    Raising his little plaint in vain, to rave                         410
    For the broad bosom of his nursing wave:
    The woods drooped darkly, as inclined to rest,
    The tropic bird wheeled rockward to his nest,
    And the blue sky spread round them like a lake
    Of peace, where Piety her thirst might slake.


                    XVIII.

    But through the palm and plantain, hark, a Voice!
    Not such as would have been a lover's choice,
    In such an hour, to break the air so still;
    No dying night-breeze, harping o'er the hill,
    Striking the strings of nature, rock and tree,                     420
    Those best and earliest lyres of Harmony,
    With Echo for their chorus; nor the alarm
    Of the loud war-whoop to dispel the charm;
    Nor the soliloquy of the hermit owl,
    Exhaling all his solitary soul,
    The dim though large-eyed winged anchorite,
    Who peals his dreary Paean o'er the night;
    But a loud, long, and naval whistle, shrill
    As ever started through a sea-bird's bill;
    And then a pause, and then a hoarse "Hillo!                        430
    Torquil, my boy! what cheer? Ho! brother, ho!"
    "Who hails?" cried Torquil, following with his eye
    The sound. "Here's one," was all the brief reply.



                    XIX.

    But here the herald of the self-same mouth[395]
    Came breathing o'er the aromatic south,
    Not like a "bed of violets" on the gale,
    But such as wafts its cloud o'er grog or ale,
    Borne from a short frail pipe, which yet had blown
    Its gentle odours over either zone,
    And, puffed where'er winds rise or waters roll,                    440
    Had wafted smoke from Portsmouth to the Pole,
    Opposed its vapour as the lightning flashed,
    And reeked, 'midst mountain-billows, unabashed,
    To AEolus a constant sacrifice,
    Through every change of all the varying skies.
    And what was he who bore it?--I may err,
    But deem him sailor or philosopher.[396]
    Sublime Tobacco! which from East to West
    Cheers the tar's labour or the Turkman's rest;
    Which on the Moslem's ottoman divides                              450
    His hours, and rivals opium and his brides;
    Magnificent in Stamboul, but less grand,
    Though not less loved, in Wapping or the Strand;
    Divine in hookas, glorious in a pipe,
    When tipped with amber, mellow, rich, and ripe:
    Like other charmers, wooing the caress,
    More dazzlingly when daring in full dress;
    Yet thy true lovers more admire by far[fp]
    Thy naked beauties--Give me a cigar![397]



                    XX.

    Through the approaching darkness of the wood                       460
    A human figure broke the solitude,
    Fantastically, it may be, arrayed,
    A seaman in a savage masquerade;
    Such as appears to rise out from the deep,
    When o'er the line the merry vessels sweep,
    And the rough Saturnalia of the tar
    Flock o'er the deck, in Neptune's borrowed car;[398]
    And, pleased, the God of Ocean sees his name
    Revive once more, though but in mimic game
    Of his true sons, who riot in the breeze                           470
    Undreamt of in his native Cyclades.
    Still the old God delights, from out the main,
    To snatch some glimpses of his ancient reign.
    Our sailor's jacket, though in ragged trim,
    His constant pipe, which never yet burned dim,
    His foremast air, and somewhat rolling gait,
    Like his dear vessel, spoke his former state;
    But then a sort of kerchief round his head,
    Not over tightly bound, nor nicely spread;
    And, 'stead of trowsers (ah! too early torn!                       480
    For even the mildest woods will have their thorn)
    A curious sort of somewhat scanty mat
    Now served for inexpressibles and hat;
    His naked feet and neck, and sunburnt face,
    Perchance might suit alike with either race.
    His arms were all his own, our Europe's growth,
    Which two worlds bless for civilising both;
    The musket swung behind his shoulders broad,
    And somewhat stooped by his marine abode,
    But brawny as the boar's; and hung beneath,                        490
    His cutlass drooped, unconscious of a sheath,
    Or lost or worn away; his pistols were
    Linked to his belt, a matrimonial pair--
    (Let not this metaphor appear a scoff,
    Though one missed fire, the other would go off);
    These, with a bayonet, not so free from rust
    As when the arm-chest held its brighter trust,
    Completed his accoutrements, as Night
    Surveyed him in his garb heteroclite.


                    XXI.

    "What cheer, Ben Bunting?" cried (when in full view                500
    Our new acquaintance) Torquil. "Aught of new?"
    "Ey, ey!" quoth Ben, "not new, but news enow;
    A strange sail in the offing."--"Sail! and how?
    What! could you make her out? It cannot be;
    I've seen no rag of canvass on the sea."
    "Belike," said Ben, "you might not from the bay,
    But from the bluff-head, where I watched to-day,
    I saw her in the doldrums; for the wind
    Was light and baffling."--"When the Sun declined
    Where lay she? had she anchored?"--"No, but still                  510
    She bore down on us, till the wind grew still."
    "Her flag?"--"I had no glass: but fore and aft,
    Egad! she seemed a wicked-looking craft."
    "Armed?"--"I expect so;--sent on the look-out:
    'Tis time, belike, to put our helm about."
    "About?--Whate'er may have us now in chase,
    We'll make no running fight, for that were base;
    We will die at our quarters, like true men."
    "Ey, ey! for that 'tis all the same to Ben."
    "Does Christian know this?"--"Aye; he has piped all hands          520
    To quarters. They are furbishing the stands
    Of arms; and we have got some guns to bear,
    And scaled them. You are wanted."--"That's but fair;
    And if it were not, mine is not the soul
    To leave my comrades helpless on the shoal.
    My Neuha! ah! and must my fate pursue
    Not me alone, but one so sweet and true?
    But whatsoe'er betide, ah, Neuha! now
    Unman me not: the hour will not allow
    A tear; I am thine whatever intervenes!"                           530
    "Right," quoth Ben; "that will do for the marines."[399]




                             CANTO THE THIRD.


                    I.

    The fight was o'er; the flashing through the gloom,
    Which robes the cannon as he wings a tomb,
    Had ceased; and sulphury vapours upward driven
    Had left the Earth, and but polluted Heaven:
    The rattling roar which rung in every volley
    Had left the echoes to their melancholy;
    No more they shrieked their horror, boom for boom;
    The strife was done, the vanquished had their doom;
    The mutineers were crushed, dispersed, or ta'en,
    Or lived to deem the happiest were the slain.                       10
    Few, few escaped, and these were hunted o'er
    The isle they loved beyond their native shore.
    No further home was theirs, it seemed, on earth,
    Once renegades to that which gave them birth;
    Tracked like wild beasts, like them they sought the wild,
    As to a Mother's bosom flies the child;
    But vainly wolves and lions seek their den,
    And still more vainly men escape from men.


                    II.

    Beneath a rock whose jutting base protrudes
    Far over Ocean in its fiercest moods,                               20
    When scaling his enormous crag the wave
    Is hurled down headlong, like the foremost brave,
    And falls back on the foaming crowd behind,
    Which fight beneath the banners of the wind,
    But now at rest, a little remnant drew
    Together, bleeding, thirsty, faint, and few;
    But still their weapons in their hands, and still
    With something of the pride of former will,
    As men not all unused to meditate,
    And strive much more than wonder at their fate.                     30
    Their present lot was what they had foreseen,
    And dared as what was likely to have been;
    Yet still the lingering hope, which deemed their lot
    Not pardoned, but unsought for or forgot,
    Or trusted that, if sought, their distant caves
    Might still be missed amidst the world of waves,
    Had weaned their thoughts in part from what they saw
    And felt, the vengeance of their country's law.
    Their sea-green isle, their guilt-won Paradise,
    No more could shield their Virtue or their Vice:                    40
    Their better feelings, if such were, were thrown
    Back on themselves,--their sins remained alone.
    Proscribed even in their second country, they
    Were lost; in vain the World before them lay;
    All outlets seemed secured. Their new allies
    Had fought and bled in mutual sacrifice;
    But what availed the club and spear, and arm
    Of Hercules, against the sulphury charm,
    The magic of the thunder, which destroyed
    The warrior ere his strength could be employed?                     50
    Dug, like a spreading pestilence, the grave
    No less of human bravery than the brave![400]
    Their own scant numbers acted all the few
    Against the many oft will dare and do;
    But though the choice seems native to die free,
    Even Greece can boast but one Thermopylae,
    Till _now_, when she has forged her broken chain
    Back to a sword, and dies and lives again!



                    III.

    Beside the jutting rock the few appeared,
    Like the last remnant of the red-deer's herd;                       60
    Their eyes were feverish, and their aspect worn,
    But still the hunter's blood was on their horn.
    A little stream came tumbling from the height,
    And straggling into ocean as it might,
    Its bounding crystal frolicked in the ray,
    And gushed from cliff to crag with saltless spray;
    Close on the wild, wide ocean, yet as pure
    And fresh as Innocence, and more secure,
    Its silver torrent glittered o'er the deep,
    As the shy chamois' eye o'erlooks the steep,                        70
    While far below the vast and sullen swell
    Of Ocean's alpine azure rose and fell.
    To this young spring they rushed,--all feelings first
    Absorbed in Passion's and in Nature's thirst,--
    Drank as they do who drink their last, and threw
    Their arms aside to revel in its dew;
    Cooled their scorched throats, and washed the gory stains
    From wounds whose only bandage might be chains;
    Then, when their drought was quenched, looked sadly round,
    As wondering how so many still were found                           80
    Alive and fetterless:--but silent all,
    Each sought his fellow's eyes, as if to call
    On him for language which his lips denied,
    As though their voices with their cause had died.


                    IV.

    Stern, and aloof a little from the rest,
    Stood Christian, with his arms across his chest.
    The ruddy, reckless, dauntless hue once spread
    Along his cheek was livid now as lead;
    His light-brown locks, so graceful in their flow,
    Now rose like startled vipers o'er his brow.                        90
    Still as a statue, with his lips comprest
    To stifle even the breath within his breast,
    Fast by the rock, all menacing, but mute,
    He stood; and, save a slight beat of his foot,
    Which deepened now and then the sandy dint
    Beneath his heel, his form seemed turned to flint.
    Some paces further Torquil leaned his head
    Against a bank, and spoke not, but he bled,--
    Not mortally:--his worst wound was within;
    His brow was pale, his blue eyes sunken in,                        100
    And blood-drops, sprinkled o'er his yellow hair,
    Showed that his faintness came not from despair,
    But Nature's ebb. Beside him was another,
    Rough as a bear, but willing as a brother,--
    Ben Bunting, who essayed to wash, and wipe,
    And bind his wound--then calmly lit his pipe,
    A trophy which survived a hundred fights,
    A beacon which had cheered ten thousand nights.
    The fourth and last of this deserted group
    Walked up and down--at times would stand, then stoop               110
    To pick a pebble up--then let it drop--
    Then hurry as in haste--then quickly stop--
    Then cast his eyes on his companions--then
    Half whistle half a tune, and pause again--
    And then his former movements would redouble,
    With something between carelessness and trouble.
    This is a long description, but applies
    To scarce five minutes passed before the eyes;
    But yet _what_ minutes! Moments like to these
    Rend men's lives into immortalities.                               120


                    V.

    At length Jack Skyscrape, a mercurial man,
    Who fluttered over all things like a fan,
    More brave than firm, and more disposed to dare
    And die at once than wrestle with despair,
    Exclaimed, "G--d damn!"--those syllables intense,--
    Nucleus of England's native eloquence,
    As the Turk's "Allah!" or the Roman's more
    Pagan "Proh Jupiter!" was wont of yore
    To give their first impressions such a vent,
    By way of echo to embarrassment.[fq]                               130
    Jack was embarrassed,--never hero more,
    And as he knew not what to say, he swore:
    Nor swore in vain; the long congenial sound
    Revived Ben Bunting from his pipe profound;
    He drew it from his mouth, and looked full wise,
    But merely added to the oath his _eyes_;
    Thus rendering the imperfect phrase complete,
    A peroration I need not repeat.


                    VI.

    But Christian,[401] of a higher order, stood
    Like an extinct volcano in his mood;                               140
    Silent, and sad, and savage,--with the trace
    Of passion reeking from his clouded face;
    Till lifting up again his sombre eye,
    It glanced on Torquil, who leaned faintly by.
    "And is it thus?" he cried, "unhappy boy!
    And thee, too, _thee_--my madness must destroy!"
    He said, and strode to where young Torquil stood,
    Yet dabbled with his lately flowing blood;
    Seized his hand wistfully, but did not press,
    And shrunk as fearful of his own caress;                           150
    Enquired into his state: and when he heard
    The wound was slighter than he deemed or feared,
    A moment's brightness passed along his brow,
    As much as such a moment would allow.
    "Yes," he exclaimed, "we are taken in the toil,
    But not a coward or a common spoil;
    Dearly they have bought us--dearly still may buy,--
    And I must fall; but have _you_ strength to fly?
    'Twould be some comfort still, could you survive;
    Our dwindled band is now too few to strive.                        160
    Oh! for a sole canoe! though but a shell,
    To bear you hence to where a hope may dwell!
    For me, my lot is what I sought; to be,
    In life or death, the fearless and the free."


                    VII.

    Even as he spoke, around the promontory,
    Which nodded o'er the billows high and hoary,
    A dark speck dotted Ocean: on it flew
    Like to the shadow of a roused sea-mew;
    Onward it came--and, lo! a second followed--
    Now seen--now hid--where Ocean's vale was hollowed;                170
    And near, and nearer, till the dusky crew
    Presented well-known aspects to the view,
    Till on the surf their skimming paddles play,
    Buoyant as wings, and flitting through the spray;--
    Now perching on the wave's high curl, and now
    Dashed downward in the thundering foam below,
    Which flings it broad and boiling sheet on sheet,
    And slings its high flakes, shivered into sleet:
    But floating still through surf and swell, drew nigh
    The barks, like small birds through a lowering sky.                180
    Their art seemed nature--such the skill to sweep
    The wave of these born playmates of the deep.


                    VIII.

    And who the first that, springing on the strand,
    Leaped like a Nereid from her shell to land,
    With dark but brilliant skin, and dewy eye
    Shining with love, and hope, and constancy?
    Neuha--the fond, the faithful, the adored--
    Her heart on Torquil's like a torrent poured;
    And smiled, and wept, and near, and nearer clasped,
    As if to be assured 'twas _him_ she grasped;                       190
    Shuddered to see his yet warm wound, and then,
    To find it trivial, smiled and wept again.
    She was a warrior's daughter, and could bear
    Such sights, and feel, and mourn, but not despair.
    Her lover lived,--nor foes nor fears could blight
    That full-blown moment in its all delight:
    Joy trickled in her tears, joy filled the sob
    That rocked her heart till almost heard to throb;
    And Paradise was breathing in the sigh
    Of Nature's child in Nature's ecstasy.                             200


                    IX.

    The sterner spirits who beheld that meeting
    Were not unmoved; who are, when hearts are greeting?
    Even Christian gazed upon the maid and boy
    With tearless eye, but yet a gloomy joy
    Mixed with those bitter thoughts the soul arrays
    In hopeless visions of our better days,
    When all's gone--to the rainbow's latest ray.
    "And but for me!" he said, and turned away;
    Then gazed upon the pair, as in his den
    A lion looks upon his cubs again;                                  210
    And then relapsed into his sullen guise,
    As heedless of his further destinies.


                    X.

    But brief their time for good or evil thought;
    The billows round the promontory brought
    The plash of hostile oars.--Alas! who made
    That sound a dread? All around them seemed arrayed
    Against them, save the bride of Toobonai:
    She, as she caught the first glimpse o'er the bay
    Of the armed boats, which hurried to complete
    The remnant's ruin with their flying feet,[fr]                     220
    Beckoned the natives round her to their prows,
    Embarked their guests and launched their light canoes;
    In one placed Christian and his comrades twain--
    But she and Torquil must not part again.
    She fixed him in her own.--Away! away!
    They cleared the breakers, dart along the bay,
    And towards a group of islets, such as bear
    The sea-bird's nest and seal's surf-hollowed lair,
    They skim the blue tops of the billows; fast
    They flew, and fast their fierce pursuers chased.                  230
    They gain upon them--now they lose again,--
    Again make way and menace o'er the main;
    And now the two canoes in chase divide,
    And follow different courses o'er the tide,
    To baffle the pursuit.--Away! away!
    As Life is on each paddle's flight to-day,
    And more than Life or lives to Neuha: Love
    Freights the frail bark and urges to the cove;
    And now the refuge and the foe are nigh--
    Yet, yet a moment! Fly, thou light ark, fly!                       240




                            CANTO THE FOURTH.


                    I.

    White as a white sail on a dusky sea,
    When half the horizon's clouded and half free,
    Fluttering between the dun wave and the sky,
    Is Hope's last gleam in Man's extremity.
    Her anchor parts; but still her snowy sail
    Attracts our eye amidst the rudest gale:
    Though every wave she climbs divides us more,
    The heart still follows from the loneliest shore.


                    II.

    Not distant from the isle of Toobonai,
    A black rock rears its bosom o'er the spray,                        10
    The haunt of birds, a desert to mankind,
    Where the rough seal reposes from the wind,
    And sleeps unwieldy in his cavern dun,
    Or gambols with huge frolic in the sun:
    There shrilly to the passing oar is heard
    The startled echo of the Ocean bird,
    Who rears on its bare breast her callow brood,
    The feathered fishers of the solitude.
    A narrow segment of the yellow sand
    On one side forms the outline of a strand;[402]                     20
    Here the young turtle, crawling from his shell,
    Steals to the deep wherein his parents dwell;
    Chipped by the beam, a nursling of the day,
    But hatched for ocean by the fostering ray;
    The rest was one bleak precipice, as e'er
    Gave mariners a shelter and despair;
    A spot to make the saved regret the deck
    Which late went down, and envy the lost wreck.
    Such was the stern asylum Neuha chose
    To shield her lover from his following foes;                        30
    But all its secret was not told; she knew
    In this a treasure hidden from the view.


                    III.

    Ere the canoes divided, near the spot,
    The men that manned what held her Torquil's lot,
    By her command removed, to strengthen more
    The skiff which wafted Christian from the shore.
    This he would have opposed; but with a smile
    She pointed calmly to the craggy isle,
    And bade him "speed and prosper." _She_ would take
    The rest upon herself for Torquil's sake.                           40
    They parted with this added aid; afar,
    The Proa darted like a shooting star,
    And gained on the pursuers, who now steered
    Right on the rock which she and Torquil neared.
    They pulled; her arm, though delicate, was free
    And firm as ever grappled with the sea,
    And yielded scarce to Torquil's manlier strength.
    The prow now almost lay within its length
    Of the crag's steep inexorable face,
    With nought but soundless waters for its base;                      50
    Within a hundred boats' length was the foe,
    And now what refuge but their frail canoe?
    This Torquil asked with half upbraiding eye,
    Which said--"Has Neuha brought me here to die?
    Is this a place of safety, or a grave,
    And yon huge rock the tombstone of the wave?"


                    IV.

    They rested on their paddles, and uprose
    Neuha, and pointing to the approaching foes,
    Cried, "Torquil, follow me, and fearless follow!"
    Then plunged at once into the Ocean's hollow.                       60
    There was no time to pause--the foes were near--
    Chains in his eye, and menace in his ear;
    With vigour they pulled on, and as they came,
    Hailed him to yield, and by his forfeit name.
    Headlong he leapt--to him the swimmer's skill
    Was native, and now all his hope from ill:
    But how, or where? He dived, and rose no more;
    The boat's crew looked amazed o'er sea and shore.
    There was no landing on that precipice,
    Steep, harsh, and slippery as a berg of ice.                        70
    They watched awhile to see him float again,
    But not a trace rebubbled from the main:
    The wave rolled on, no ripple on its face,
    Since their first plunge recalled a single trace;
    The little whirl which eddied, and slight foam,
    That whitened o'er what seemed their latest home,
    White as a sepulchre above the pair
    Who left no marble (mournful as an heir)
    The quiet Proa wavering o'er the tide
    Was all that told of Torquil and his bride;                         80
    And but for this alone the whole might seem
    The vanished phantom of a seaman's dream.
    They paused and searched in vain, then pulled away;
    Even Superstition now forbade their stay.
    Some said he had not plunged into the wave,
    But vanished like a corpse-light from a grave;
    Others, that something supernatural
    Glared in his figure, more than mortal tall;
    While all agreed that in his cheek and eye
    There was a dead hue of Eternity.                                   90
    Still as their oars receded from the crag,
    Round every weed a moment would they lag,
    Expectant of some token of their prey;
    But no--he had melted from them like the spray.


                    V.

    And where was he the Pilgrim of the Deep,
    Following the Nereid? Had they ceased to weep
    For ever? or, received in coral caves,
    Wrung life and pity from the softening waves?
    Did they with Ocean's hidden sovereigns dwell,
    And sound with Mermen the fantastic shell?                         100
    Did Neuha with the mermaids comb her hair
    Flowing o'er ocean as it streamed in air?
    Or had they perished, and in silence slept
    Beneath the gulf wherein they boldly leapt?


                    VI.

    Young Neuha plunged into the deep, and he
    Followed: her track beneath her native sea
    Was as a native's of the element,
    So smoothly--bravely--brilliantly she went,
    Leaving a streak of light behind her heel,
    Which struck and flashed like an amphibious steel,                 110
    Closely, and scarcely less expert to trace
    The depths where divers hold the pearl in chase,
    Torquil, the nursling of the northern seas,
    Pursued her liquid steps with heart and ease.
    Deep--deeper for an instant Neuha led
    The way--then upward soared--and as she spread
    Her arms, and flung the foam from off her locks,
    Laughed, and the sound was answered by the rocks.
    They had gained a central realm of earth again,
    But looked for tree, and field, and sky, in vain.                  120
    Around she pointed to a spacious cave,
    Whose only portal was the keyless wave,[403]
    (A hollow archway by the sun unseen,
    Save through the billows' glassy veil of green,
    In some transparent ocean holiday,
    When all the finny people are at play,)
    Wiped with her hair the brine from Torquil's eyes,
    And clapped her hands with joy at his surprise;
    Led him to where the rock appeared to jut,
    And form a something like a Triton's hut;                          130
    For all was darkness for a space, till day,
    Through clefts above let in a sobered ray;
    As in some old cathedral's glimmering aisle
    The dusty monuments from light recoil,
    Thus sadly in their refuge submarine
    The vault drew half her shadow from the scene.



                    VII.

    Forth from her bosom the young savage drew
    A pine torch, strongly girded with gnatoo;
    A plantain-leaf o'er all, the more to keep
    Its latent sparkle from the sapping deep.                          140
    This mantle kept it dry; then from a nook
    Of the same plantain-leaf a flint she took,
    A few shrunk withered twigs, and from the blade
    Of Torquil's knife struck fire, and thus arrayed
    The grot with torchlight. Wide it was and high,
    And showed a self-born Gothic canopy;
    The arch upreared by Nature's architect,
    The architrave some Earthquake might erect;
    The buttress from some mountain's bosom hurled,
    When the Poles crashed, and water was the world;                   150
    Or hardened from some earth-absorbing fire,
    While yet the globe reeked from its funeral pyre;
    The fretted pinnacle, the aisle, the nave,[404]
    Were there, all scooped by Darkness from her cave.
    There, with a little tinge of phantasy,
    Fantastic faces moped and mowed on high,
    And then a mitre or a shrine would fix
    The eye upon its seeming crucifix.
    Thus Nature played with the stalactites,[405]
    And built herself a Chapel of the Seas.                            160



                    VIII.

    And Neuha took her Torquil by the hand,
    And waved along the vault her kindled brand,
    And led him into each recess, and showed
    The secret places of their new abode.
    Nor these alone, for all had been prepared
    Before, to soothe the lover's lot she shared:
    The mat for rest; for dress the fresh gnatoo,
    And sandal oil to fence against the dew;
    For food the cocoa-nut, the yam, the bread
    Born of the fruit; for board the plantain spread                   170
    With its broad leaf, or turtle-shell which bore
    A banquet in the flesh it covered o'er;
    The gourd with water recent from the rill,
    The ripe banana from the mellow hill;
    A pine-torch pile to keep undying light,
    And she herself, as beautiful as night,
    To fling her shadowy spirit o'er the scene,
    And make their subterranean world serene.
    She had foreseen, since first the stranger's sail
    Drew to their isle, that force or flight might fail,               180
    And formed a refuge of the rocky den
    For Torquil's safety from his countrymen.[fs]
    Each dawn had wafted there her light canoe,
    Laden with all the golden fruits that grew;
    Each eve had seen her gliding through the hour
    With all could cheer or deck their sparry bower;
    And now she spread her little store with smiles,
    The happiest daughter of the loving isles.


                    IX.

    She, as he gazed with grateful wonder, pressed
    Her sheltered love to her impassioned breast;                      190
    And suited to her soft caresses, told
    An olden tale of Love,--for Love is old,
    Old as eternity, but not outworn
    With each new being born or to be born:[406]
    How a young Chief, a thousand moons ago,
    Diving for turtle in the depths below,
    Had risen, in tracking fast his ocean prey,
    Into the cave which round and o'er them lay;
    How, in some desperate feud of after-time,
    He sheltered there a daughter of the clime,                        200
    A foe beloved, and offspring of a foe,
    Saved by his tribe but for a captive's woe;
    How, when the storm of war was stilled, he led
    His island clan to where the waters spread
    Their deep-green shadow o'er the rocky door,
    Then dived--it seemed as if to rise no more:
    His wondering mates, amazed within their bark,
    Or deemed him mad, or prey to the blue shark;
    Rowed round in sorrow the sea-girded rock,
    Then paused upon their paddles from the shock;                     210
    When, fresh and springing from the deep, they saw
    A Goddess rise--so deemed they in their awe;
    And their companion, glorious by her side,
    Proud and exulting in his Mermaid bride;
    And how, when undeceived, the pair they bore
    With sounding conchs and joyous shouts to shore;
    How they had gladly lived and calmly died,--
    And why not also Torquil and his bride?
    Not mine to tell the rapturous caress
    Which followed wildly in that wild recess                          220
    This tale; enough that all within that cave
    Was love, though buried strong as in the grave,
    Where Abelard, through twenty years of death,
    When Eloisa's form was lowered beneath
    Their nuptial vault, his arms outstretched, and pressed
    The kindling ashes to his kindled breast.[407]
    The waves without sang round their couch, their roar
    As much unheeded as if life were o'er;
    Within, their hearts made all their harmony,
    Love's broken murmur and more broken sigh.                         230


                    X.

    And they, the cause and sharers of the shock
    Which left them exiles of the hollow rock,
    Where were they? O'er the sea for life they plied,
    To seek from Heaven the shelter men denied.
    Another course had been their choice--but where?
    The wave which bore them still their foes would bear,
    Who, disappointed of their former chase,
    In search of Christian now renewed their race.
    Eager with anger, their strong arms made way,
    Like vultures baffled of their previous prey.                      240
    They gained upon them, all whose safety lay
    In some bleak crag or deeply-hidden bay:
    No further chance or choice remained; and right
    For the first further rock which met their sight
    They steered, to take their latest view of land,
    And yield as victims, or die sword in hand;
    Dismissed the natives and their shallop, who
    Would still have battled for that scanty crew;
    But Christian bade them seek their shore again,
    Nor add a sacrifice which were in vain;                            250
    For what were simple bow and savage spear
    Against the arms which must be wielded here?



                    XI.

    They landed on a wild but narrow scene,
    Where few but Nature's footsteps yet had been;
    Prepared their arms, and with that gloomy eye,
    Stern and sustained, of man's extremity,
    When Hope is gone, nor Glory's self remains
    To cheer resistance against death or chains.--
    They stood, the three, as the three hundred stood
    Who dyed Thermopylae with holy blood.                              260
    But, ah! how different! 'tis the _cause_ makes all,
    Degrades or hallows courage in its fall.
    O'er them no fame, eternal and intense,
    Blazed through the clouds of Death and beckoned hence;
    No grateful country, smiling through her tears,
    Begun the praises of a thousand years;
    No nation's eyes would on their tomb be bent,
    No heroes envy them their monument;
    However boldly their warm blood was spilt,
    Their Life was shame, their Epitaph was guilt.                     270
    And this they knew and felt, at least the one,
    The leader of the band he had undone;
    Who, born perchance for better things, had set
    His life upon a cast which lingered yet:
    But now the die was to be thrown, and all
    The chances were in favour of his fall:
    And such a fall! But still he faced the shock,
    Obdurate as a portion of the rock
    Whereon he stood, and fixed his levelled gun,
    Dark as a sullen cloud before the sun.                             280


                    XII.

    The boat drew nigh, well armed, and firm the crew
    To act whatever Duty bade them do;
    Careless of danger, as the onward wind
    Is of the leaves it strews, nor looks behind.
    And, yet, perhaps, they rather wished to go
    Against a nation's than a native foe,
    And felt that this poor victim of self-will,
    Briton no more, had once been Britain's still.
    They hailed him to surrender--no reply;
    Their arms were poised, and glittered in the sky.                  290
    They hailed again--no answer; yet once more
    They offered quarter louder than before.
    The echoes only, from the rock's rebound,
    Took their last farewell of the dying sound.
    Then flashed the flint, and blazed the volleying flame,
    And the smoke rose between them and their aim,
    While the rock rattled with the bullets' knell,
    Which pealed in vain, and flattened as they fell;
    Then flew the only answer to be given
    By those who had lost all hope in earth or heaven.                 300
    After the first fierce peal as they pulled nigher,
    They heard the voice of Christian shout, "Now, fire!"
    And ere the word upon the echo died,
    Two fell; the rest assailed the rock's rough side,
    And, furious at the madness of their foes,
    Disdained all further efforts, save to close.
    But steep the crag, and all without a path,
    Each step opposed a bastion to their wrath,
    While, placed 'midst clefts the least accessible,
    Which Christian's eye was trained to mark full well,               310
    The three maintained a strife which must not yield,
    In spots where eagles might have chosen to build.
    Their every shot told; while the assailant fell,
    Dashed on the shingles like the limpet shell;
    But still enough survived, and mounted still,
    Scattering their numbers here and there, until
    Surrounded and commanded, though not nigh
    Enough for seizure, near enough to die,
    The desperate trio held aloof their fate
    But by a thread, like sharks who have gorged the bait;             320
    Yet to the very last they battled well,
    And not a groan informed their foes _who_ fell.
    Christian died last--twice wounded; and once more
    Mercy was offered when they saw his gore;
    Too late for life, but not too late to die,[ft]
    With, though a hostile hand, to close his eye.
    A limb was broken, and he drooped along
    The crag, as doth a falcon reft of young.[fu]
    The sound revived him, or appeared to wake
    Some passion which a weakly gesture spake:                         330
    He beckoned to the foremost, who drew nigh,
    But, as they neared, he reared his weapon high--
    His last ball had been aimed, but from his breast
    He tore the topmost button from his vest,[408][fv]
    Down the tube dashed it--levelled--fired, and smiled
    As his foe fell; then, like a serpent, coiled
    His wounded, weary form, to where the steep
    Looked desperate as himself along the deep;
    Cast one glance back, and clenched his hand, and shook
    His last rage 'gainst the earth which he forsook;                  340
    Then plunged: the rock below received like glass
    His body crushed into one gory mass,
    With scarce a shred to tell of human form,
    Or fragment for the sea-bird or the worm;
    A fair-haired scalp, besmeared with blood and weeds,
    Yet reeked, the remnant of himself and deeds;
    Some splinters of his weapons (to the last,
    As long as hand could hold, he held them fast)
    Yet glittered, but at distance--hurled away
    To rust beneath the dew and dashing spray.                         350
    The rest was nothing--save a life mis-spent,
    And soul--but who shall answer where it went?
    'Tis ours to bear, not judge the dead; and they
    Who doom to Hell, themselves are on the way,
    Unless these bullies of eternal pains
    Are pardoned their bad hearts for their worse brains.



                    XIII.

    The deed was over! All were gone or ta'en,
    The fugitive, the captive, or the slain.
    Chained on the deck, where once, a gallant crew,
    They stood with honour, were the wretched few                      360
    Survivors of the skirmish on the isle;
    But the last rock left no surviving spoil.
    Cold lay they where they fell, and weltering,
    While o'er them flapped the sea-birds' dewy wing,
    Now wheeling nearer from the neighbouring surge,
    And screaming high their harsh and hungry dirge:
    But calm and careless heaved the wave below,
    Eternal with unsympathetic flow;
    Far o'er its face the Dolphins sported on,
    And sprung the flying fish against the sun,                        370
    Till its dried wing relapsed from its brief height,
    To gather moisture for another flight.


                    XIV.

    'Twas morn; and Neuha, who by dawn of day
    Swam smoothly forth to catch the rising ray,
    And watch if aught approached the amphibious lair
    Where lay her lover, saw a sail in air:
    It flapped, it filled, and to the growing gale
    Bent its broad arch: her breath began to fail
    With fluttering fear, her heart beat thick and high,
    While yet a doubt sprung where its course might lie.               380
    But no! it came not; fast and far away
    The shadow lessened as it cleared the bay.
    She gazed, and flung the sea-foam from her eyes,
    To watch as for a rainbow in the skies.
    On the horizon verged the distant deck,
    Diminished, dwindled to a very speck--
    Then vanished. All was Ocean, all was Joy!
    Down plunged she through the cave to rouse her boy;
    Told all she had seen, and all she hoped, and all
    That happy love could augur or recall;                             390
    Sprung forth again, with Torquil following free
    His bounding Nereid over the broad sea;
    Swam round the rock, to where a shallow cleft
    Hid the canoe that Neuha there had left
    Drifting along the tide, without an oar,
    That eve the strangers chased them from the shore;
    But when these vanished, she pursued her prow,
    Regained, and urged to where they found it now:
    Nor ever did more love and joy embark,
    Than now were wafted in that slender ark.                          400


                    XV.

    Again their own shore rises on the view,
    No more polluted with a hostile hue;
    No sullen ship lay bristling o'er the foam,
    A floating dungeon:--all was Hope and Home!
    A thousand Proas darted o'er the bay,
    With sounding shells, and heralded their way;
    The chiefs came down, around the people poured,
    And welcomed Torquil as a son restored;
    The women thronged, embracing and embraced
    By Neuha, asking where they had been chased,                       410
    And how escaped? The tale was told; and then
    One acclamation rent the sky again;
    And from that hour a new tradition gave
    Their sanctuary the name of "Neuha's Cave."
    A hundred fires, far flickering from the height,[fw]
    Blazed o'er the general revel of the night,
    The feast in honour of the guest, returned
    To Peace and Pleasure, perilously earned;
    A night succeeded by such happy days
    As only the yet infant world displays.[fx]                         420

[352] [William Bligh, the son of Cornish parents, was born September 9
1754 (? 1753). He served under Cook in his second voyage in the
_Resolution_, 1772-75, as sailing-master; and, in 1782, fought under
Lord Howe at Gibraltar. He married a daughter of William Betham, first
collector of customs in the Isle of Man, and hence his connection with
Fletcher Christian, who belonged to a Manx family, and the midshipman
Peter Hayward, who was the son of a Deemster. He was appointed to the
_Bounty_ in December, 1787, and in 1791 to the _Providence_, which was
despatched to the Society Islands to obtain a fresh cargo of bread-fruit
trees in place of those which were thrown overboard by the mutineers. He
commanded the _Glatton_ at Copenhagen, May 21, 1801, and on that and
other occasions served with distinction. He was made Governor of New
South Wales in 1805, but was forcibly deposed in an insurrection headed
by Major Johnston, January, 1808. He was kept in prison till 1810, but
on his return to England his administration of his office was approved,
and Johnston was cashiered. He was advanced to the rank of Vice-Admiral
of the Blue in 1814, and died, December 7, 1817.

In his _Narrative_ Bligh describes the mutiny as "a close-planned act of
villainy," and attributes the conspiracy not to his own harshness, or to
disloyalty provoked by "real or imaginary grievances," but to the
contrast of life on board ship, "in ever climbing up the climbing wave,"
with the unearned luxuries of Tahiti, "the allurements of dissipation
... the female connections," which the sailors had left behind. Besides
his own apology, there are the sworn statements of the two midshipmen,
Hayward and Hallet, and others, which Bligh published in answer to a
pamphlet which Edward Christian, afterwards Chief Justice of Ely, wrote
in defence of his brother Fletcher. The evidence against Bligh is
contained in the MS. journal of the boatswain's mate, James Morrison,
which was saved, as by a miracle, from the wreck of the _Pandora_, and
is quoted by Sir John Barrow, Lady Belcher, and other authorities. There
is, too, the testimony of John Adams (Alexander Smith), as recorded by
Captain Beachey, and, as additional proof of indifference and tyrannical
behaviour, there are Bligh's own letters to Peter Hayward's mother and
uncle (March 26, April 2, 1790), and W. C. Wentworth's account of his
administration as Governor of New South Wales (see _A Statistical
Description_, etc., 1819, p. 166). It cannot be gainsaid that Bligh was
a man of integrity and worth, and that he was upheld and esteemed by the
Admiralty. Morrison's Journal, though in parts corroborated by Bligh's
MS. Journal, is not altogether convincing, and the testimony of John
Adams in his old age counts for little. But according to his own
supporters he "damned" his men though not the officers, and his own
_Narrative_, as well as Morrison's Journal, proves that he was
suspicious, and that he underrated and misunderstood the character and
worth of his subordinates. He was responsible for the prolonged sojourn
at Tahiti, and he should have remembered that time and distance are
powerful solvents, and that between Portsmouth Hard and the untracked
waters of the Pacific, "all Arcadia" had intervened. He was a man of
imperfect sympathies, wanting in tact and fineness, but in the hour of
need he behaved like a hero, and saved himself and others by submission
to duty and strenuous self-control. Moreover, he "helped England" not
once or twice, "in the brave days of old." (See _A_ _Narrative, etc._,
1790; _The Naval History of Great Britain_, by E. P. Brenton, 1823, i.
96, _sq._; _Royal Naval Biography_, by John Marshall, 1823-35, ii. pp.

[353] {589}["A few hours before, my situation had been peculiarly
flattering. I had a ship in the most perfect order, and well stored with
every necessary, both for service and health; ... the voyage was two
thirds completed, and the remaining part in a very promising way."--_A
Narrative of the Mutiny, etc._, by Lieut. W. Bligh, 1790, p. 9.]

[354] ["The women at Otaheite are handsome, mild, and cheerful in their
manners and conversation, possessed of great sensibility, and have
sufficient delicacy to make them admired and beloved. The chiefs were so
much attached to our people, that they rather encouraged their stay
among them than otherwise, and even made them promises of large
possessions. Under these and many other attendant circumstances equally
desirable, it is now, perhaps, not so much to be wondered at ... that a
set of sailors, most of them void of connections, should be led away,
especially when they imagined it in their power to fix themselves, in
the midst of plenty, ... on the finest island in the world, where they
need not labour, and where the allurements of dissipation are beyond
anything that can be conceived,"--_Ibid._, p. 10.]

[355] {591}["Just before sunrising Mr. Christian, with the
master-at-arms, gunner's mate, and Thomas Burkitt, seaman, came into my
cabin while I was asleep, and, seizing me, tied my hands with a cord
behind my back, and threatened me with instant death if I spoke or made
the least noise. I, however, called out so loud as to alarm every one;
but they had already secured the officers who were not of their party,
by placing sentinels at their doors. There were three men at my cabin
door, besides the four within; Christian had only a cutlass in his hand,
the others had muskets and bayonets. I was hauled out of bed, and forced
on deck in my shirt, suffering great pain from the tightness with which
they had tied my hands.... The boatswain was now ordered to hoist the
launch out. The boat being hoisted out, Mr. Hayward and Mr. Hallet,
midshipmen, were ordered into it; upon which I demanded the cause of
such an order, and endeavoured to persuade some one to a sense of duty;
but it was to no effect: 'Hold your tongue, sir, or you are dead this
instant,' was constantly repeated to me."--_A Narrative of the Mutiny,
etc._, by Lieut. W. Bligh, 1790, pp. 1, 2.]

[356] ["The boatswain, and seamen who were to go in the boat, were
allowed to collect twine, canvass, lines, sails, cordage, an
eight-and-twenty-gallon cask of water, and the carpenter to take his
tool-chest. Mr. Samuel got one hundred and fifty pounds of bread with a
small quantity of rum and wine ... also a quadrant and
compass."--_Ibid._, p. 3.]

[357] {592}["The mutineers now hurried those they meant to get rid of
into the boat, ... Christian directed a dram to be served to each of his
own crew."--_A Narrative, etc._, 1790, p. 3.]

[358] [It was Johnson, not Burke, who upheld the claims of brandy.--"He
was persuaded," says Boswell, "to drink one glass of it [claret]. He
shook his head, and said, 'Poor stuff!--No, Sir, claret is the liquor
for boys; port for men; but he who aspires to be a hero (smiling) must
drink brandy.'"--Boswell's _Life of Johnson_, 1848, p. 627.]

[359] ["While the ship ... was in sight she steered to the W.N.W., but I
considered this only a feint; for when we were sent away, 'Huzza for
Otaheite!' was frequently heard among the mutineers."--_A Narrative,
etc._, 1790, pp. 4-8. This statement is questioned by Sir John Barrow
(_The Eventful History, etc._, 1831, p. 91), on the grounds that the
mutiny was the result of a sudden determination on the part of
Christian, and that liberty, and not the delights of Tahiti, was the
object which the mutineers had in view.]

[361] ["Isaac Martin, one of the guard over me, I saw, had an
inclination to assist me; and as he fed me with shaddock (my lips being
quite parched with my endeavours to bring about a change), we explained
our wishes to each other by our looks; but this being observed, Martin
was instantly removed from me."--_A Narrative, etc._, 1790, p. 4.]

[362] {594}["Christian ... then ... said, 'Come, Captain Bligh, your
officers and men are now in the boat; and you must go with them; if you
attempt to make the least resistance you will instantly be put to
death;' and without any farther ceremony, holding me by the cord that
tied my hands, with a tribe of armed ruffians about me, I was forced
over the side, where they untied my hands. Being in the boat, we were
veered astern by a rope. A few pieces of pork were thrown to me and some
clothes.... After having undergone a great deal of ridicule, and being
kept for some time to make sport for these unfeeling wretches, we were
at length cast adrift in the open ocean.... When they were forcing me
out of the ship, I asked him [Christian] if this treatment was a proper
return for the many instances he had received of my friendship? He
appeared disturbed at the question, and answered, with much emotion,
'That,--Captain Bligh,--that is the thing;--I am in hell--I am in
hell.'"--_A Narrative, etc._, 1790, pp. 4-8.

Bligh's testimony on this point does not correspond with Morrison's
journal, or with the evidence of the master, John Fryer, given at the
court-martial, September 12, 1792. According to Morrison, when the
boatswain tried to pacify Christian, he replied, "It is too late, I have
been in hell for this fortnight past, and am determined to bear it no
longer." The master's version is that he appealed to Christian, and that
Christian exclaimed, "Hold your tongue, sir, I have been in hell for
weeks past; Captain Bligh has brought all this on himself." Bligh seems
to have flattered himself that in the act of mutiny Christian was seized
with remorse, but it is clear that the wish was father to the thought.
Moreover, on being questioned, Fryer, who was a supporter of the
captain, explained that Christian referred to quarrels, to abuse in
general, and more particularly to a recent accusation of stealing
cocoa-nuts. (See _The Eventful History_, etc., 1831, pp. 84, 208, 209.)]

when the launch reached Timor, he speaks of the crew as "so many
spectres, whose ghastly countenances, if the cause had been unknown,
would have excited terror rather than pity."]

have altered and added, but have retained as much as possible of the
original.

["Whilst we were talking of _Vavaoo tooa Lico_, the women said to us,
'Let us repair to the back of the island to contemplate the setting sun:
there let us listen to the warbling of the birds, and the cooing of the
wood-pigeon. We will gather flowers from the burying-place at _Matawto_,
and partake of refreshments prepared for us at _Lico O'n?_: we will
then bathe in the sea, and rinse ourselves in the _Vaoo A'ca_; we will
anoint our skins in the sun with sweet-scented oil, and will plait in
wreaths the flowers gathered at _Matawto_.' And now as we stand
motionless on the eminence over _Anoo Manoo_, the whistling of the wind
among the branches of the lofty _toa_ shall fill us with a pleasing
melancholy; or our minds shall be seized with astonishment as we behold
the roaring surf below, endeavouring but in vain to tear away the firm
rocks. Oh! how much happier shall we be thus employed, than when engaged
in the troublesome and insipid cares of life!

"Now as night comes on, we must return to the _Mooa_. But hark!--hear
you not the sound of the mats?--they are practising a _bo-oola_ ['a kind
of dance performed by torch-light'], to be performed to-night on the
_malai_, at _Tanea_. Let us also go there. How will that scene of
rejoicing call to our minds the many festivals held there, before
_Vavdoo_ was torn to pieces by war! Alas! how destructive is war!
Behold! how it has rendered the land productive of weeds, and opened
untimely graves for departed heroes! Our chiefs can now no longer enjoy
the sweet pleasure of wandering alone by moonlight in search of their
mistresses. But let us banish sorrow from our hearts: since we are at
war, we must think and act like the natives of _Fiji_, who first taught
us this destructive art. Let us therefore enjoy the present time, for
to-morrow perhaps, or the next day, we may die. We will dress ourselves
with _chi coola_, and put bands of white _tappa_ round our waists. We
will plait thick wreaths of _jiale_ for our heads, and prepare strings
of _hooni_ for our necks, that their whiteness may show off the colour
of our skins. Mark how the uncultivated spectators are profuse of their
applause! But now the dance is over: let us remain here to-night and
feast and be cheerful, and to-morrow we will depart for the Mooa. How
troublesome are the young men, begging for our wreaths of flowers! while
they say in their flattery, 'See how charming these young girls look
coming from _Licoo_!--how beautiful are their skins, diffusing around a
fragrance like the flowering precipice of _Mataloco_:--Let us also visit
_Licoo_. We will depart to-morrow.'"--_An Account of the Natives of the
Tonga Islands, etc._, 1817, i. 307, 308. See, too, for another version,

morning," says Mariner, "when the air is calm and still, the beating of
the _gnatoo_ at all the plantations about has a very pleasing effect;
some sounds being near at hand, and others almost lost by the distance,
some a little more acute, others more grave, and all with remarkable
regularity, produce a musical variety that is ... heightened by the
singing of the birds, and the cheerful influence of the

[374] [Cava, "kava," or "ava," is an intoxicating drink, prepared from
the roots and stems of a kind of pepper (_Piper methysticum_). Mariner
(_An Account, etc._, 1817, ii. 183-206) gives a highly interesting and
suggestive account of the process of brewing the kava, and of the solemn
"kava-drinking," which was attended with ceremonial rites. Briefly, a
large wooden bowl, about three feet in diameter, and one foot in depth
in the centre (see, for a typical specimen, King Thakombau's kava-bowl,
in the British Museum), is placed in front of the king or chief, who
sits in the midst, surrounded by his guests and courtiers. A portion of
kava root is handed to each person present, who chews it to a pulp, and
then deposits his quid in the kava bowl. Water being gradually added,
the roots are well squeezed and twisted by various "curvilinear turns"
of the hands and arms through the "fow," _i.e._ shavings of fibrous
bark. When the "kava is in the cup," quaighs made of the "unexpanded
leaf of the banana" are handed round to the guests, and the symposium
begins. Mariner (_ibid._, p. 205, note) records a striking feature of
the preliminary rites, a consecration or symbolic "grace before"
drinking. "When a god has no priest, as Tali-y-Toobo [the Supreme Deity
of the Tongans], no person ... presides at the head of his cava circle,
the place being left ... vacant, but which it is supposed the god
invisibly occupies.... And they go through the usual form of words, as
if the first cup was actually filled and presented to the god: thus,
before any cup is filled, the man by the side of the bowl says ... 'The
cava is in the cup:' the mataboole answers ... 'Give it to our god:' but
this is mere form, for there is no cup filled for the god." (See, too,
_The Making of Religion_, by A. Lang, 1900, p. 279.)]

[381] {605}[George Stewart was born at Ronaldshay (circ. 1764), but was
living at Stromness in 1780 (where his father's house, "The White
House," is still shown), when, on the homeward voyage of the Resolution,
Cook and Bligh were hospitably entertained by his parents. He was of
honourable descent. His mother's ancestors were sprung from a
half-brother of Mary Stuart's, and his father's family dated back to
1400. When he was at Timor, Bligh gave a "description of the pirates"
for purposes of identification by the authorities at Calcutta and
elsewhere. "George Stewart, midshipman, aged 23 years, is five feet
seven inches high, good complexion, dark hair, slender made ... small
face, and black eyes; tatowed on the left breast with a star," etc.
Lieutenant Bligh took Stewart with him, partly in return for the
"civilities" at Stromness, but also because "he was a seaman, and had
always borne a good character." Alexander Smith told Captain Beachey
(_Narrative of a Voyage to the Pacific_, 1831, Part I. p. 53) that it
was Stewart who advised Christian "to take possession of the ship," but
Peter Hayward, who survived to old age, strenuously maintained that this
was a calumny, that Stewart was forcibly detained in his cabin, and that
he would not, in any case, have taken part in the mutiny. He had,
perhaps, already wooed and won a daughter of the isles, and when the
_Bounty_ revisited Tahiti, September 20, 1789, he was put ashore, and
took up his quarters in her father's house. There he remained till
March, 1791, when he "voluntarily surrendered himself" to the captain of
the _Pandora_, and was immediately put in irons. The story of his
parting from his bride is told in _A Missionary Voyage to the Southern
Pacific Ocean in the Ship Duff_ (by W. Wilson), 1799, p. 360: "The
history of Peggy Stewart marks a tenderness of heart that never will be
heard without emotion.... They had lived with the old chief in the most
tender state of endearment; a beautiful little girl had been the fruit
of their union, and was at the breast when the Pandora arrived....
Frantic with grief, the unhappy Peggy ... flew with her infant in a
canoe to the arms of her husband. She was separated from him by
violence, and conveyed on shore in a state of despair and grief too big
for utterance ... she sank into the deepest dejection, pined under a
rapid decay ... and fell a victim to her feelings, dying literally of a
broken heart." Stewart was drowned or killed by an accident during the
wreck of the _Pandora_, August 29, 1791. _Sunt lacrymae rerum!_ It is a
mournful tale.]

[382] {606} The "ship of the desert" is the Oriental figure for the
camel or dromedary; and they deserve the metaphor well,--the former for
his endurance, the latter for his swiftness. [Compare _The Deformed

[385] The consul Nero, who made the unequalled march which deceived
Hannibal, and defeated Asdrubal; thereby accomplishing an achievement
almost unrivalled in military annals. The first intelligence of his
return, to Hannibal, was the sight of Asdrubal's head thrown into his
camp. When Hannibal saw this, he exclaimed with a sigh, that "Rome would
now be the mistress of the world." And yet to this victory of Nero's it
might be owing that his imperial namesake reigned at all. But the infamy
of one has eclipsed the glory of the other. When the name of "Nero" is
heard, who thinks of the consul?--But such are human things! [For

[388] When very young, about eight years of age, after an attack of the
scarlet fever at Aberdeen, I was removed by medical advice into the
Highlands. Here I passed occasionally some summers, and from this period
I date my love of mountainous countries. I can never forget the effect,
a few years afterwards, in England, of the only thing I had long seen,
even in miniature, of a mountain, in the Malvern Hills. After I returned
to Cheltenham, I used to watch them every afternoon, at sunset, with a
sensation which I cannot describe. This was boyish enough: but I was
then only thirteen years of age, and it was in the holidays. [Byron
spent his summer holidays, 1796-98, at the farm-house of Ballatrich, on
Deeside. (See _Poetical Works_, 1898, i. 192, note 2. For his visit to
Cheltenham, in the summer of 1801, see _Life_, pp. 8, 19.)

the Western as to the Eastern reader. [Compare _Werner_, act iv. sc. 1,

[394] {613} If the reader will apply to his ear the sea-shell on his
chimney-piece, he will be aware of what is alluded to. If the text
should appear obscure, he will find in _Gebir_ the same idea better
expressed in two lines. The poem I never read, but have heard the lines
quoted, by a more recondite reader--who seems to be of a different
opinion from the editor of the _Quarterly Review_, who qualified it in
his answer to the Critical Reviewer of his _Juvenal_, as trash of the
worst and most insane description. It is to Mr. Landor, the author of
_Gebir_, so qualified, and of some Latin poems, which vie with Martial
or Catullus in obscenity, that the immaculate Mr. Southey addresses his
declamation against impurity!

[These are the lines in _Gebir_ to which Byron alludes--

    "But I have sinuous shells of pearly hue.

           *       *       *       *       *

    Shake one and it awakens; then apply
    Its polisht lips to your attentive ear,
    And it remembers its august abodes,
    And murmurs as the ocean murmurs there."

Compare, too, _The Excursion_, bk. iv.--

                           "I have seen
    A curious child, who dwelt upon a tract
    Of inland ground, applying to his ear
    The convolutions of a smooth-lipped shell,
    To which, in silence hushed, his very soul
    Listened intently," etc.

Landor, in his _Satire upon Satirists_, 1836, p. 29, commenting on
Wordsworth's alleged remark that he "would not give five shillings for
all the poetry that Southey had written" (see _Letters_, 1900, iv.
Appendix IX. pp. 483, 484), calls attention to this unacknowledged
borrowing, "It would have been honester," he says, "and more decorous if
the writer of the following verses had mentioned from what bar he drew
his wire." According to H. C. Robinson (_Diary_, 1869, iii. 114),
Wordsworth acknowledged no obligation to Landor's _Gebir_ for the image
of the sea-shell. "From his childhood the shell was familiar to him,
etc. The 'Satire' seemed to give Wordsworth little annoyance."]

[395] {615}[In his Preface to Cantos I., II. of _Childe Harold_
(_Poetical Works_, 1899, ii. 5), Byron relies on the authority of
"Ariosto Thomson and Beattie" for the inclusion of droll or satirical
"variations" in a serious poem. Nevertheless, Dallas prevailed on him to
omit certain "ludicrous stanzas." It is to be regretted that no one
suggested the excision of sections xix.-xxi. from the second canto of
The Island.]

[396] Hobbes, the father of Locke's and other philosophy, was an
inveterate smoker,--even to pipes beyond computation.

["Soon after dinner he [Hobbes] retired to his study, and had his
candle, with ten or twelve pipes of tobacco laid by him; then, shutting
his door, he fell to smoking, and thinking, and writing for several
hours."--_Memoirs of the Family of Cavendish_, by White Kennet, D.D.,
1708, pp. 14, 15.]

[fp] _Yet they who love thee best prefer by far_.--[MS. D. erased.]

[397] ["I shall now smoke two cigars, and get me to bed.... The Havannah
are the best;--but neither are so pleasant as a hooka or
chiboque."--_Journal_, December 6, 1813, _Letters_, 1898, ii. 368.]

[398] {616} This rough but jovial ceremony, used in crossing the line,
has been so often and so well described, that it need not be more than
alluded to.

[399] {617} "That will do for the marines, but the sailors won't believe
it," is an old saying: and one of the few fragments of former jealousies
which still survive (in jest only) between these gallant services.

[400] {619} Archidamus, King of Sparta, and son of Agesilaus, when he
saw a machine invented for the casting of stones and darts, exclaimed
that it was the "grave of valour." The same story has been told of some
knights on the first application of gunpowder; but the original anecdote
is in Plutarch. [The Greek is "????????, ?????? ????? [A)po/lolen,
a)ndro\s a)reta/]," Plutarch's _Scripta Moralia_, 1839, i. 230.]

[fq] {621} _To people in a small embarrassment_.--[MS. D. erased.]

[401] {622} [Fletcher Christian, born 1763, was the fourth son of
Charles Christian, an attorney, of Moreland Close, in the parish of
Brigham, Cumberland. His family, which was of Manx extraction, was
connected with the Christians of Ewanrigg, and the Curwens of Workington
Hall. His brother Edward became Chief Justice of Ely, and was well known
as the editor of _Blackstones Commentaries_. For purposes of
verification (see _An Answer to certain Assertions, etc._, 1794, p. 9),
Bligh described him as "aged 24 years, five feet nine inches high,
blackish or very dark brown complexioned, dark brown hair, strong made,
star tatowed on the left breast," etc. According to "Morrison's
Journal," high words had passed between Bligh and Christian on more than
one occasion, and, on the day before the mutiny, a question having
arisen with regard to the disappearance of some cocoa-nuts, Christian
was cross-examined by the captain as to his share of the plunder. "I
really do not know, sir," he replied; "but I hope you do not think me so
mean as to be guilty of stealing yours." "Yes," said Bligh,
"you ---- hound, I do think so, or you could have given a better account
of them." It was after this offensive accusation that Christian
determined, in the first instance, to quit the ship, and on the morning
of April 28, 1788, finding the mate of the watch asleep, on the spur of
the moment resolved to lay violent hands on the captain, and assume the
command of the _Bounty_. The language attributed to Bligh reads like a
translation into the vernacular, but if Christian kept his designs to
himself, it is strange that they were immediately understood and acted
upon by a body of impromptu conspirators. Testimony, whether written or
spoken, with regard to the succession of events "in moments like to
these," is worth very little; but it is pretty evident that Christian
was a gentleman, and that Bligh's violent and unmannerly ratings were
the immediate cause of the mutiny.

Contradictory accounts are given of Christian's death. It is generally
believed that in the fourth year of the settlement on Pitcairn Island
the Tahitians formed a plot to massacre the Englishmen, and that
Christian was shot when at work in his plantation (_The Mutineers,
etc._, by Lady Belcher, 1870, p. 163; _The Mutiny, etc._, by Rosalind A.
Young, 1894, p. 28). On the other hand, Amasa Delano, in his _Narrative
of Voyages, etc._ (Boston, 1817, cap. v. p. 140), asserts that Captain
Mayhew Folger, who was the first to visit the island in 1808, "was very
explicit in his inquiry at the time, as well as in his account of it to
me, that they lived under Christian's government several years after
they landed; that during the whole time they enjoyed tolerable harmony;
that Christian became sick, and died a natural death." It stands to
reason that the ex-pirate, Alexander Smith, who had developed into John
Adams, the pious founder of a patriarchal colony, would be anxious to
draw a veil over the early years of the settlement, and would satisfy
the curiosity of visitors who were officers of the Royal Navy, as best
he could, and as the spirit moved him.]

[fr] {625} _The ruined remnant of the land's defeat_.--[MS. D. erased.]

[402] {626}[Compare _The Siege of Corinth_, lines 438, 439, Poetical
Works, 1900, iii. 467.]

[403] {629} Of this cave (which is no fiction) the original will be
found in the ninth chapter of "Mariner's Account of the Tonga Islands"
[1817, i. 267-279]. I have taken the poetical liberty to transplant it
to Toobonai, the last island where any distinct account is left of
Christian and his comrades.

[The following is the account given by Mariner: "On this island [Hoonga]
there is a peculiar cavern, which was first discovered by a young chief,
whilst diving after a turtle. The nature of this cavern will be better
understood if we imagine a hollow rock rising sixty feet or more above
the surface of the water, into the cavity of which there is no known
entrance but one, and that is on the side of the rock, as low down as
six feet under the water, into which it flows; and, consequently, the
base of the cavern may be said to be the sea itself." Mariner seeing
some young chiefs diving into the water one after another, and not rise
again, he inquired of the last, ... what they were about? "'Follow me,'"
said he, "'and I will take you where you have never been before....'"
Mariner prepared to follow his companion, and, guided by the light
reflected from his heels, entered the opening in the rock, and rose into
the cavern. The light was sufficient, after remaining about five
minutes, to show objects with some little distinctness; ...
Nevertheless, as it was desirable to have a stronger light, Mariner
dived out again, and, priming his pistol, tied plenty of gnatoo tight
round it, and wrapped the whole up in a plantain-leaf: he directed an
attendant to bring a torch in the same way. Thus prepared, he re-entered
the cavern, unwrapped the gnatoo, fired it by the flash of the powder,
and lighted the torch. "The place was now illuminated tolerably well....
It appeared (by guess) to be about forty feet wide in the main part, but
it branched off, on one side, in two narrower portions. The medium
height seemed also about forty feet. The roof was hung with stalactites
in a very curious way, resembling, upon a cursory view, the Gothic
arches and ornaments of an old church." According to one of the
matabooles present, the entire family of a certain chief had, in former
times, been condemned to death for conspiring against a rival
tyrant--the chief to be taken out to sea and drowned, the rest of the
family to be massacred. One of the chiefs daughters was a beautiful
girl, to whom the youth who discovered the cave was attached. "He had
long been enamoured of this young maiden, but had never dared to make
her acquainted with the soft emotions of his heart, knowing that she was
betrothed to a chief of higher rank and greater power, but now, ... no
time was to be lost; he flew to her abode ... declared himself her
deliverer if she would trust to his honour.... Soon her consenting hand
was clasped in his: the shades of evening favoured their escape ... till
her lover had brought a small canoe to a lonely part of the beach. In
this they speedily embarked.... They soon arrived at the rock, he leaped
into the water, and she, instructed by him, followed close after; they
rose into the cavern, and rested from their fatigue, partaking of some
refreshments which he had brought there for himself...." Here she
remained, visited from time to time by her more fortunate Leander, until
he was enabled to carry her off to the Fiji islands, where they dwelt
till the death of the tyrant, when they returned to Vavaoo, "and lived
long in peace and happiness."]

[404] {631} This may seem too minute for the general outline (in
Mariner's Account) from which it is taken. But few men have travelled
without seeing something of the kind--on _land_, that is. Without
adverting to Ellora, in Mungo Park's last journal, he mentions having
met with a rock or mountain so exactly resembling a Gothic cathedral,
that only minute inspection could convince him that it was a work of
nature.

[Ellora, a village in the Nizam's dominions, is thirteen miles
north-west of Aurangabad. "It is famous for its rock-caves and temples.
The chief building, called the kailas, ... is a great monolithic temple,
isolated from surrounding rock, and carved outside as well as in.... It
is said to have been built about the eighth century by Raja Edu of
Ellichpur."--Hunter's _Imperial Gazetteer of India_, 1885, iv. 348-351.
The passage in Mungo Park's _Journal of a Mission to the Interior of
Africa_, 1815, p. 75, runs thus: "June 24th [1805],--Left Sullo, and
travelled through a country beautiful beyond imagination, with all the
possible diversities of _rock_, sometimes towering up like ruined
castles, spires, pyramids, etc. We passed one place so like a ruined
Gothic abbey, that we halted a little, before we could satisfy ourselves
that the niches, windows, etc., were all natural rock."]

[405] [Byron's quadrisyllable was, probably, a poetic licence. There is,
however, an obsolete plural, _stalactitae_, to be found in the works of
John Woodward, M.D., _Fossils of England_, 1729, i. 155.]

[fs] {632} _Where Love and Torquil might lie safe from men_.--[MS. D.
erased.]

[406] {633} The reader will recollect the epigram of the Greek
anthology, or its translation into most of the modern languages--

    "Whoe'er thou art, thy master see--
    He was, or is, or is to be."

[Byron is quoting from memory an "Illustration" in the notes to
_Collections from the Greek Anthology_, by the Rev. Robert Bland, 1813,
p. 402--

    "Whoe'er thou art, thy Lord and master see.
    Thou wast my Slave, thou art, or thou shall be."

The couplet was written by George Granville, Lord Lansdowne (1667-1735),
as an _Inscription for a Figure representing the God of Love_. (See _The
Genuine Works, etc._, 1732, I. 129.)]

[407] {634} The tradition is attached to the story of Eloisa, that when
her body was lowered into the grave of Abelard (who had been buried
twenty years), he opened his arms to receive her.

[The story is told by Bayle, who quotes from a manuscript chronicle of
Tours, preserved in the notes of Andreas Quercetanus, affixed to the
_Historia Calamitatum Abaelardi_: "Eadem defuncta ad tumulam apertum
depertata, maritus ejus qui multis diebus ante eam defunctus fuerat,
elevatis brachiis eam recepit, et ita earn amplexatus brachia sua
strinxit."--See Petri Abelardi _Opera_, Paris, 1616, ii. 1195.]

[ft] {636} _Too late it might be still at least to die_.--[MS. D.
erased.]

[fu] {637} _The crag as droop a bird without her young_.--[MS. D.
erased.]

[408] In Thibault's account of Frederick the Second of Prussia, there is
a singular relation of a young Frenchman, who with his mistress appeared
to be of some rank. He enlisted and deserted at Schweidnitz; and after a
desperate resistance was retaken, having killed an officer, who
attempted to seize him after he was wounded, by the discharge of his
musket loaded with a _button_ of his uniform. Some circumstances on his
court-martial raised a great interest amongst his judges, who wished to
discover his real situation in life, which he offered to disclose, but
to the king only, to whom he requested permission to write. This was
refused, and Frederic was filled with the greatest indignation, from
baffled curiosity or some other motive, when he understood that his
request had been denied. [_Mes Souvenirs de vingt ans de sejour a

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

PREFACE TO THE SEVENTH VOLUME.


Of the seventy-three "Epigrams and Jeux d'Esprit," which are printed at
the commencement of this volume, forty-five were included in Murray's
one-volume edition of 1837, eighteen have been collected from various
publications, and ten are printed and published for the first time.

The "Devil's Drive," which appears in Moore's _Letters and Journals_,
and in the sixth volume of the Collected Edition of 1831 as an
"Unfinished Fragment" of ninety-seven lines, is now printed and
published for the first time in its entirety (248 lines), from a MS. in
the possession of the Earl of Ilchester. "A Farewell Petition to J.C.H.
Esq.;" "My Boy Hobbie O;" "[Love and Death];" and "Last Words on
Greece," are reprinted from the first volume of _Murray's Magazine_
(1887).

A few imperfect and worthless poems remain in MS.; but with these and
one or two other unimportant exceptions, the present edition of the
Poetical Works may be regarded as complete.

In compiling a "Bibliography of the successive Editions and Translations
of Lord Byron's Poetical Works," I have endeavoured, in the first
instance, to give a full and particular account of the collected
editions and separate issues of the poems and dramas which were open to
my inspection; and, secondly, to extract from general bibliographies,
catalogues of public and private libraries, and other sources
bibliographical records of editions which I have been unable to examine,
and were known to me only at second-hand. It will be observed that the
_title-pages_ of editions which have passed through my hands are
aligned; the _titles_ of all other editions are italicized.

I cannot pretend that this assortment of bibliographical entries is even
approximately exhaustive; but as "a sample" of a bibliography it will, I
trust, with all its imperfections, be of service to the student of
literature, if not to the amateur or bibliophile. With regard to
nomenclature and other technicalities, my aim has been to put the
necessary information as clearly and as concisely as possible, rather
than to comply with the requirements of this or that formula. But the
path of the bibliographer is beset with difficulties. "Al Sirat's
arch"--"the bridge of breadth narrower than the thread of a famished
spider, and sharper than the edge of a sword" (see _The Giaour_, line
483, _note_ I)--affords an easier and a safer foothold.

To the general reader a bibliography says little or nothing; but, in one
respect, a bibliography of Byron is of popular import. It affords
scientific proof of an almost unexampled fame, of a far-reaching and
still potent influence. Teuton and Latin and Slav have taken Byron to
themselves, and have made him their own. No other English poet except
Shakespeare has been so widely read and so frequently translated. Of
_Manfred_ I reckon one Bohemian translation, two Danish, two Dutch,
three French, nine German, three Hungarian, three Italian, two Polish,
one Romaic, one Roumanian, four Russian, and three Spanish translations,
and, in all probability, there are others which have escaped my net. The
question, the inevitable question, arises--What was, what is, the secret
of Byron's Continental vogue? and why has his fame gone out into all
lands? Why did Goethe enshrine him, in the second part of _Faust_, "as
the representative of the modern era ... undoubtedly to be regarded as
the greatest genius of our century?" (_Conversations of Goethe_, 1874,
p. 265).

It is said, and with truth, that Byron's revolutionary politics
commended him to oppressed nationalities and their sympathizers; that he
was against "the tramplers"--Castlereagh, and the Duke of Wellington,
and the Holy Alliance; that he stood for liberty. Another point in his
favour was his freedom from cant, his indifference to the pieties and
proprieties of the Britannic Muse; that he had the courage of his
opinions. Doubtless in a time of trouble he was welcomed as the champion
of revolt, but deeper reasons must be sought for an almost exclusive
preference for the works of one poet and a comparative indifference to
the works of his rivals and contemporaries. He fulfilled another,
perhaps a greater ideal. An Englishman turns to poetry for the
expression in beautiful words of his happier and better feelings, and he
is not contented unless poetry tends to make him happier or
better--happier because better than he would be otherwise. His favourite
poems are psalms, or at least metrical paraphrases, of life. Men of
other nations are less concerned about their feelings and their souls.
They regard the poet as the creator, the inventor, the maker _par
excellence_, and he who can imagine or make the greatest _eidolon_ is
the greatest poet. _Childe Harold_ and _The Corsair_, _Mazeppa_ and
_Manfred, Cain_ and _Sardanapalus_ were new creations, new types, forms
more real than living man, which appealed to their artistic sense, and
led their imaginations captive. "It is a mark," says Goethe (_Aus meinem
Leben: Dichtung und Wahreit_, 1876, iii. 125), "of true poetry, that, as
a secular gospel, it knows how to free us from the earthly burdens which
press upon us, by inward serenity, by outward charm.... The most lively,
as well as the gravest works have the same end--to moderate both
pleasure and pain through a happy mental representation." It is passion
translated into action, the pageantry of history, the transfiguration
into visible lineaments of living moods and breathing thoughts which are
the notes of this "secular gospel," and for one class of minds work out
a secular redemption.

It was not only the questionable belief that he was on the side of the
people, or his ethical and theological audacities, or his prolonged
Continental exile, which won for Byron a greater name abroad than he has
retained at home; but the character of his poetry. "The English may
think of Byron as they please" (_Conversations of Goethe_, 1874, p.
171), "but this is certain, that they can show no poet who is to be
compared to him. He is different from all the others, and, for the most
part, greater." The English may think of him as they please! and for
them, or some of them, there is "a better oenomel," a _vinum Daemonum_,
which Byron has not in his gift. The evidence of a world-wide fame will
not endear a poet to a people and a generation who care less for the
matter than the manner of verse, or who _believe_ in poetry as the
symbol or "_credo_" of the imagination or the spirit; but it should
arrest attention and invite inquiry. A bibliography is a dull epilogue
to a poet's works, but it speaks with authority, and it speaks last.
_Finis coronat opus!_

I must be permitted to renew my thanks to Mr. G.F. Barwick,
_Superintendent of the Reading Room_, Mr. Cyril Davenport, and other
officials of the British Museum, of all grades and classes, for their
generous and courteous assistance in the preparation and completion of
the Bibliography. The consultation of many hundreds of volumes of one
author, and the permission to retain a vast number in daily use, have
entailed exceptional labour on a section of the staff. I have every
reason to be grateful.

I am indebted to Mr. A.W. Pollard, of the British Museum, for advice and
direction with regard to bibliographical formulas; to Mr. G.L. Calderon,
late of the staff, for the collection and transcription of the
title-pages of Polish, Russian, and Servian translations; and to Mr. R.
Nisbet Bain for the supervision and correction of the proofs of Slavonic
titles.

To Mr. W.P. Courtney, the author of _Bibliotheca Cornubiensis_, I owe
many valuable hints and suggestions, and the opportunity of consulting
some important works of reference.

I have elsewhere acknowledged the valuable information with regard to
certain rare editions and pamphlets which I have received from Mr. H.
Buxton Forman, C.B.

My especial thanks for laborious researches undertaken on my behalf, and
for information not otherwise attainable, are due to M. J.E. Aynard, of
Lyons; Signor F. Bianco; Professor Max von Forster, of Wurtzburg;
Professor Lajos Gurnesovitz, of Buda Pest; Dr. Holzhausen, of Bonn; Mr.
Leonard Mackall, of Berlin; Miss Peacock; Miss K. Schlesinger; M.
Voynich, of Soho Square; Mr. Theodore Bartholomew, of the University
Library of Cambridge; Mr. T.D. Stewart, of the Croydon Public Library;
and the Librarians of Trinity College, Cambridge, and University
College, St. Andrews.

I have also to thank, for special and generous assistance, Mr. J.P.
Anderson, late of the British Museum, the author of the "Bibliography of
Byron's Works" attached to the Life of Lord Byron by the Hon. Roden Noel
(1890); Miss Grace Reed, of Philadelphia, for bibliographical entries of
early American editions; and Professor Vladimir Hrabar, of the
University of Dorpat, for the collection and transcription of numerous
Russian translations of Byron's Works.

To Messrs. Clowes, the printers of these volumes, and to their reader,
Mr. F.T. Peachey, I am greatly indebted for the transcription of
Slavonic titles included in the Summary of the Bibliography, and for
interesting and useful information during the progress of the work.

In conclusion, I must once more express my acknowment of the industry
and literary ability of my friend Mr. F.E. Taylor, of Chertsey, who has
read the proofs of this and the six preceding volumes.

The Index is the work of Mr. C. Eastlake Smith.

JEUX D'ESPRIT AND MINOR POEMS, 1798-1824.



                    EPIGRAM ON AN OLD LADY WHO HAD
              SOME CURIOUS NOTIONS RESPECTING THE SOUL.

    IN Nottingham county there lives at Swan Green,[1]
      As curst an old Lady as ever was seen;
    And when she does die, which I hope will be soon,
      She firmly believes she will go to the Moon!

                                                                     1798.
                   [First published, _Letters and Journals_, 1830, i. 28.]

FOOTNOTES:

[1] "Swan Green" should be "Swine Green." It lay about a quarter of a
mile to the east of St. James's Lane, where Byron lodged in 1799, at the
house of a Mr. Gill. The name appears in a directory of 1799, but by
1815 it had been expunged or changed _euphoniae gratia_. (See _A New Plan
of the Town of Nottingham_, ... 1744.)

Moore took down "these rhymes" from the lips of Byron's nurse, May Gray,
who regarded them as a first essay in the direction of poetry. He
questioned their originality.



                 EPITAPH ON JOHN ADAMS, OF SOUTHWELL,
                 A CARRIER, WHO DIED OF DRUNKENNESS.

    JOHN ADAMS lies here, of the parish of Southwell,
    A _Carrier_ who _carried_ his can to his mouth well;
    He carried so much and he carried so fast,
    He could carry no more--so was carried at last;
    For the liquor he drank being too much for one,
    He could not _carry_ off;--so he's now _carri-on_.

                                                        _September_, 1807.

              A VERSION OF OSSIAN'S ADDRESS TO THE SUN.

                       FROM THE POEM "CARTHON."

    O THOU! who rollest in yon azure field,
    Round as the orb of my forefather's shield,
    Whence are thy beams? From what eternal store
    Dost thou, O Sun! thy vast effulgence pour?
    In awful grandeur, when thou movest on high,
    The stars start back and hide them in the sky;
    The pale Moon sickens in thy brightening blaze,
    And in the western wave avoids thy gaze.
    Alone thou shinest forth--for who can rise
    Companion of thy splendour in the skies!
    The mountain oaks are seen to fall away--
    Mountains themselves by length of years decay--
    With ebbs and flows is the rough Ocean tost;
    In heaven the Moon is for a season lost,
    But thou, amidst the fullness of thy joy,
    The same art ever, blazing in the sky!
    When tempests wrap the world from pole to pole,
    When vivid lightnings flash and thunders roll,
    Thou far above their utmost fury borne,
    Look'st forth in beauty, laughing them to scorn.
    But vainly now on me thy beauties blaze--
    Ossian no longer can enraptured gaze!
    Whether at morn, in lucid lustre gay,
    On eastern clouds thy yellow tresses play,
    Or else at eve, in radiant glory drest,
    Thou tremblest at the portals of the west,
    I see no more! But thou mayest fail at length,
    Like Ossian lose thy beauty and thy strength,
    Like him--but for a season--in thy sphere
    To shine with splendour, then to disappear!
    Thy years shall have an end, and thou no more
    Bright through the world enlivening radiance pour,
    But sleep within thy clouds, and fail to rise,
    Heedless when Morning calls thee to the skies!
    Then now exult, O Sun! and gaily shine,
    While Youth and Strength and Beauty all are thine.
    For Age is dark, unlovely, as the light
    Shed by the Moon when clouds deform the night,
    Glimmering uncertain as they hurry past.
    Loud o'er the plain is heard the northern blast,
    Mists shroud the hills, and 'neath the growing gloom,
    The weary traveller shrinks and sighs for home.

                                                                     1806.
                 [First published, _Atlantic Monthly_, December, 1898.][2]

FOOTNOTES:

[2] [I am indebted to the courtesy of Mr. Pierre De La Rose for sending
me a copy of the foregoing _Version of Ossian's Address to the Sun_,
which was "Privately printed at the Press of Oliver B. Graves,
Cambridge, Massachusetts, June the Tenth, MDCCCXCVIII.," and was
reprinted in the _Atlantic Monthly_ in December, 1898. A prefatory note
entitled, "From Lord Byron's Notes," is prefixed to the Version: "In
Lord Byron's copy of _The Poems of Ossian_ (printed by Dewick and
Clarke, London, 1806), which, since 1874, has been in the possession of
the Library of Harvard University as part of the Sumner Bequest. The
notes which follow appear in Byron's hand." (For the _Notes_, see the
_Atlantic Monthly_, 1898, vol. lxxxii. pp. 810-814.)

It is strange that Byron should have made two versions (for another
"version" from the Newstead MSS., see _Poetical Works_, 1898, i.
229-231) of the "Address to the Sun," which forms the conclusion of
"Carthon;" but the Harvard version appears to be genuine. It is to be
noted that Byron appended to the earlier version eighteen lines of his
own composition, by way of moral or application.]



                        LINES TO MR. HODGSON.

                 WRITTEN ON BOARD THE LISBON PACKET.

                                  1.

    HUZZA! Hodgson[3], we are going,
      Our embargo's off at last;
    Favourable breezes blowing
      Bend the canvas o'er the mast.
    From aloft the signal's streaming,
      Hark! the farewell gun is fired;
    Women screeching, tars blaspheming,
      Tell us that our time's expired.
        Here's a rascal
        Come to task all,
      Prying from the Custom-house;
        Trunks unpacking
        Cases cracking,
      Not a corner for a mouse
    Scapes unsearched amid the racket,
    Ere we sail on board the Packet.

                                  2.

    Now our boatmen quit their mooring,
      And all hands must ply the oar;
    Baggage from the quay is lowering,
      We're impatient, push from shore.
    "Have a care! that case holds liquor--
      Stop the boat--I'm sick--oh Lord!"
    "Sick, Ma'am, damme, you'll be sicker,
      Ere you've been an hour on board."
        Thus are screaming
        Men and women,
      Gemmen, ladies, servants, Jacks;
        Here entangling,
        All are wrangling,
      Stuck together close as wax.--
    Such the general noise and racket,
    Ere we reach the Lisbon Packet.

                                  3.

    Now we've reached her, lo! the Captain,
      Gallant Kidd,[4] commands the crew;
    Passengers their berths are clapt in,
      Some to grumble, some to spew.
    "Hey day! call you that a cabin?
      Why't is hardly three feet square!
    Not enough to stow Queen Mab in--
      Who the deuce can harbour there?"
        "Who, sir? plenty--
        Nobles twenty
      Did at once my vessel fill."--
        "Did they? Jesus,
        How you squeeze us!
      Would to God they did so still!
    Then I'd 'scape the heat and racket
    Of the good ship, Lisbon Packet."

                                  4.

    Fletcher! Murray! Bob![5] where are you?
      Stretched along the deck like logs--
    Bear a hand, you jolly tar, you!
      Here's a rope's end for the dogs.
    Hobhouse muttering fearful curses,
      As the hatchway down he rolls,
    Now his breakfast, now his verses,
      Vomits forth--and damns our souls.
        "Here's a stanza[6]
        On Braganza--
      Help!"--"A couplet?"--"No, a cup
        Of warm water--"
        "What's the matter?"
      "Zounds! my liver's coming up;
    I shall not survive the racket
    Of this brutal Lisbon Packet."

                                  5.

    Now at length we're off for Turkey,
      Lord knows when we shall come back!
    Breezes foul and tempests murky
      May unship us in a crack.
    But, since Life at most a jest is,
      As philosophers allow,
    Still to laugh by far the best is,
      Then laugh on--as I do now.
        Laugh at all things,
        Great and small things,
      Sick or well, at sea or shore;
        While we're quaffing,
        Let's have laughing--
      Who the devil cares for more?--
    Some good wine! and who would lack it,
    Ev'n on board the Lisbon Packet?

                                          Falmouth Roads, _June_ 30, 1809.

                      [TO DIVES.[7] A FRAGMENT.]

    UNHAPPY Dives! in an evil hour
      'Gainst Nature's voice seduced to deeds accurst!
      Once Fortune's minion now thou feel'st her power;
      Wrath's vial on thy lofty head hath burst.
      In Wit, in Genius, as in Wealth the first,
      How wondrous bright thy blooming morn arose!
      But thou wert smitten with th' unhallowed thirst
      Of Crime unnamed, and thy sad noon must close
    In scorn and solitude unsought the worst of woes.

                                                                     1809.

                FAREWELL PETITION TO J.C.H., ESQ^RE^.

    O THOU yclep'd by vulgar sons of Men
    Cam Hobhouse![8] but by wags Byzantian Ben!
    Twin sacred titles, which combined appear
    To grace thy volume's front, and gild its rear,
    Since now thou put'st thyself and work to Sea
    And leav'st all Greece to _Fletcher_[9] and to me,
    Oh, hear my single muse our sorrows tell,
    _One_ song for _self_ and Fletcher quite as well--

    First to the _Castle_ of that man of woes
    Dispatch the letter which _I must_ enclose,
    And when his lone Penelope shall say
    _Why, where_, and _wherefore_ doth my William stay?
    Spare not to move her pity, or her pride--
    By all that Hero suffered, or defied;
    The _chicken's toughness_, and the _lack_ of _ale_
    The _stoney mountain_ and the _miry vale_
    The _Garlick_ steams, which _half_ his meals enrich,
    The _impending vermin_, and the threatened _Itch_,
    That _ever breaking_ Bed, beyond repair!
    The hat too _old_, the coat too _cold_ to wear,
    The Hunger, _which repulsed from Sally's door_
    Pursues her grumbling half from shore to shore,
    Be these the themes to greet his faithful Rib
    So may thy pen be smooth, thy tongue be glib!

    This duty done, let me in turn demand
    Some friendly office in my native land,
    Yet let me ponder well, before I ask,
    And set thee swearing at the tedious task.

    First the Miscellany![10]--to Southwell town
    _Per coach_ for Mrs. _Pigot_ frank it down,
    So may'st them prosper in the paths of Sale,[11]
    And Longman smirk and critics cease to rail.

    All hail to Matthews![12] wash his reverend feet,
    And in my name the man of Method greet,--
    Tell him, my Guide, Philosopher, and Friend,
    Who cannot love me, and who will not mend,
    Tell him, that not in vain I shall assay
    To tread and trace our "old Horatian way,"[13]
    And be (with prose supply my dearth of rhymes)
    What better men have been in better times.

    Here let me cease, for why should I prolong
    My notes, and vex a _Singer_ with a _Song_?
    Oh thou with pen perpetual in thy fist!
    Dubbed for thy sins a stark Miscellanist,
    So pleased the printer's orders to perform
    For Messrs. _Longman_, _Hurst_ and _Rees_ and _Orme_.
    Go--Get thee hence to Paternoster Row,
    Thy patrons wave a duodecimo!
    (Best form for _letters_ from a distant land,
    It fits the pocket, nor fatigues the hand.)
    Then go, once more the joyous work commence[14]
    With stores of anecdote, and grains of sense,
    Oh may Mammas relent, and Sires forgive!
    And scribbling Sons grow dutiful and live!

                   EPITAPH FOR JOSEPH BLACKET, LATE
                       POET AND SHOEMAKER.[17]

    STRANGER! behold, interred together,
    The _souls_ of learning and of leather.
    Poor Joe is gone, but left his _all_:
    You'll find his relics in a _stall_.
    His works were neat, and often found
    Well stitched, and with _morocco_ bound.
    Tread lightly--where the bard is laid--
    He cannot mend the shoe he made;
    Yet is he happy in his hole,
    With verse immortal as his _sole_.
    But still to business he held fast,
    And stuck to Phoebus to the _last_.
    Then who shall say so good a fellow
    Was only "leather and prunella?"
    For character--he did not lack it;
    And if he did, 'twere shame to "Black-it."

        ON MOORE'S LAST OPERATIC FARCE, OR FARCICAL OPERA.[18]

      GOOD plays are scarce,
      So Moore writes _farce_:
    The poet's fame grows brittle[i]--
      We knew before
      That _Little_'s Moore,
    But now't is Moore that's _little_.

           AN ODE[20] TO THE FRAMERS OF THE FRAME BILL.[21]

                                  1.

    OH well done Lord E---- n! and better done R----r![22]
      Britannia must prosper with councils like yours;
    Hawkesbury, Harrowby, help you to guide her,
      Whose remedy only must _kill_ ere it cures:
    Those villains; the Weavers, are all grown refractory,
     Asking some succour for Charity's sake--
    So hang them in clusters round each Manufactory,
      That will at once put an end to _mistake_.[23]

                                  2.

    The rascals, perhaps, may betake them to robbing,
      The dogs to be sure have got nothing to eat--
    So if we can hang them for breaking a bobbin,
      'T will save all the Government's money and meat:
    Men are more easily made than machinery--
      Stockings fetch better prices than lives--
    Gibbets on Sherwood will heighten the scenery,
      Shewing how Commerce, how Liberty thrives!

                                  3.

    Justice is now in pursuit of the wretches,
      Grenadiers, Volunteers, Bow-street Police,
    Twenty-two Regiments, a score of Jack Ketches,
      Three of the Quorum and two of the Peace;
    Some Lords, to be sure, would have summoned the Judges,
      To take their opinion, but that they ne'er shall,
    For LIVERPOOL such a concession begrudges,
      So now they're condemned by _no Judges_ at all.

                                  4.

    Some folks for certain have thought it was shocking,
      When Famine appeals and when Poverty groans,
    That Life should be valued at less than a stocking,
      And breaking of frames lead to breaking of bones.
    If it should prove so, I trust, by this token,
      (And who will refuse to partake in the hope?)
    That the frames of the fools may be first to be _broken_,
      Who, when asked for a _remedy_, sent down a _rope_.

                     ON LORD THURLOW'S POEMS.[30]

                                  1.

    WHEN Thurlow this damned nonsense sent,
    (I hope I am not violent)
    Nor men nor gods knew what he meant.

                                  2.

    And since not even our Rogers' praise
    To common sense his thoughts could raise--
    Why _would_ they let him print his lays?

                                  3.

       *       *       *       *       *

    To me, divine Apollo, grant--O!
    Hermilda's[31] first and second canto,
    I'm fitting up a new portmanteau;

                                  6.

    And thus to furnish decent lining,
    My own and others' bays I'm twining,--
    So, gentle Thurlow, throw me thine in.

                                                             June 2, 1813.

FOOTNOTES:

[30] [One evening, in the late spring or early summer of 1813, Byron and
Moore supped on bread and cheese with Rogers. Their host had just
received from Lord Thurlow [Edward Hovell Thurlow, 1781-1829] a copy of
his _Poems on Several Occasions_ (1813), and Byron lighted upon some
lines to Rogers, "On the Poem of Mr. Rogers, entitled 'An Epistle to a
Friend.'" The first stanza ran thus--

    "When Rogers o'er this labour bent,
    Their purest fire the Muses lent,
    T' illustrate this sweet argument."

"Byron," says Moore, "undertook to read it aloud;--but he found it
impossible to get beyond the first two words. Our laughter had now
increased to such a pitch that nothing could restrain it. Two or three
times he began; but no sooner had the words 'When Rogers' passed his
lips, than our fit burst forth afresh,--till even Mr. Rogers himself ...
found it impossible not to join us. A day or two after, Lord Byron sent
me the following:--'My dear Moore, "When Rogers" must not see the
enclosed, which I send for your perusal.'"--_Life_, p. 181; _Letters_,
1898, ii. 211-213, _note_ 1.]

Thurlow's poems are by no means contemptible. A sonnet, "To a Bird, that
haunted the Water of Lacken, in the Winter," which Charles Lamb
transcribed in one of Coleridge's note-books, should be set over against
the absurd lines, "On the Poems of Mr. Rogers."

    "O melancholy bird, a winter's day
      Thou standest by the margin of the pool;
      And, taught by God, dost thy whole being school
    To Patience, which all evil can allay:
    God has appointed thee the fish thy prey;
      And giv'n thyself a lesson to the fool
      Unthrifty, to submit to moral rule,
    And his unthinking course by thee to weigh.
      There need not schools nor the professor's chair,
    Though these be good, true wisdom to impart;
      He, who has not enough for these to spare
    Of time, or gold, may yet amend his heart,
      And teach his soul by brooks and rivers fair,
    Nature is always wise in every part."

[See "Fragments of Criticism," _Works of Charles Lamb_, 1903, iii. 284.]

[31] [_Hermilda in Palestine_ was published in 1812, in quarto, and
twice reissued in 1813, as part of _Poems on Various Occasions_ (8vo).
The Lines upon Rogers' _Epistle to a Friend_ appeared first in the
_Gentleman's Magazine_ for April, 1813, vol. 83, p. 357, and were
reprinted in the second edition of _Poems, etc._, 1813, pp. 162, 163.
The lines in italics, which precede each stanza, are taken from the last
stanza of Lord Thurlow's poem.]



                         TO LORD THURLOW.[32]

                                  1.

        "_I lay my branch of laurel down_."

    "_THOU_ lay thy branch of _laurel_ down!"
      Why, what thou'st stole is not enow;
    And, were it lawfully thine own,
      Does Rogers want it most, or thou?
    Keep to thyself thy withered bough,
      Or send it back to Doctor Donne:[33]
    Were justice done to both, I trow,
      He'd have but little, and thou--none.

                                  2.

        "_Then, thus, to form Apollo's crown_."

    A crown! why, twist it how you will,
    Thy chaplet must be foolscap still.
    When next you visit Delphi's town,
      Enquire amongst your fellow-lodgers,
    They'll tell you Phoebus gave his crown,
      Some years before your birth, to Rogers.

                                  3.

        "_Let every other bring his own_."

    When coals to Newcastle are carried,
      And owls sent to Athens, as wonders,
    From his spouse when the Regent's unmarried,
      Or Liverpool weeps o'er his blunders;
    When Tories and Whigs cease to quarrel,
      When Castlereagh's wife has an heir,
    Then Rogers shall ask us for laurel,
      And thou shalt have plenty to spare.

    "Then, thus, to form Apollo's crown,

[33] [Lord Thurlow affected an archaic style in his Sonnets and other
verses. In the Preface to the second edition of _Poems, etc._, he

language is in the reign of Queen Elizabeth."]



                      THE DEVIL'S DRIVE.[ii][34]

                                  1.

    THE Devil returned to Hell by two,
      And he stayed at home till five;
    When he dined on some homicides done in _ragout_,
      And a rebel or so in an _Irish_ stew,
    And sausages made of a self-slain Jew,
    And bethought himself what next to do,
      "And," quoth he, "I'll take a drive.
    I walked in the morning, I'll ride to-night;
    In darkness my children take most delight,
      And I'll see how my favourites thrive.                             10

                                  2.

    "And what shall I ride in?" quoth Lucifer, then--
      "If I followed my taste, indeed,
    I should mount in a waggon of wounded men,
      And smile to see them bleed.
    But these will be furnished again and again,
      And at present my purpose is speed;
    To see my manor as much as I may,
    And watch that no souls shall be poached away.

                                  3.

    "I have a state-coach at Carlton House,
      A chariot in Seymour-place;[35]                                    20
    But they're lent to two friends, who make me amends
      By driving my favourite pace:
    And they handle their reins with such a grace,
    I have something for both at the end of the race.

                                  4.

    "So now for the earth to take my chance,"
      Then up to the earth sprung he;
    And making a jump from Moscow to France,
      He stepped across the sea,
    And rested his hoof on a turnpike road,
    No very great way from a Bishop's abode.[36]                         30

                                  5.

    But first as he flew, I forgot to say,
    That he hovered a moment upon his way,
      To look upon Leipsic plain;
    And so sweet to his eye was its sulphury glare,
    And so soft to his ear was the cry of despair,
      That he perched on a mountain of slain;
    And he gazed with delight from its growing height,
    Nor often on earth had he seen such a sight,
      Nor his work done half as well:
    For the field ran so red with the blood of the dead,                 40
      That it blushed like the waves of Hell!
    Then loudly, and wildly, and long laughed he:
    "Methinks they have little need here of _me_!"

                                  6.

    Long he looked down on the hosts of each clime,
      While the warriors hand to hand were--
    Gaul--Austrian and Muscovite heroes sublime,
    And--(Muse of Fitzgerald arise with a rhyme!)
      A quantity of _Landwehr_![37]
          Gladness was there,
    For the men of all might and the monarchs of earth,                  50
    There met for the wolf and the worm to make mirth,
      And a feast for the fowls of the Air!

                                  7.

    But he turned aside and looked from the ridge
      Of hills along the river,
    And the best thing he saw was a broken bridge,[38]
      Which a Corporal chose to shiver;
    Though an Emperor's taste was displeased with his haste,
      The Devil he thought it clever;
    And he laughed again in a lighter strain,
      O'er the torrent swoln and rainy,                                  60
    When he saw "on a fiery steed" Prince Pon,
    In taking care of Number _One_--
    Get drowned with a great _many_!

                                  8.

    But the softest note that soothed his ear
      Was the sound of a widow sighing;
    And the sweetest sight was the icy tear,
    Which Horror froze in the blue eye clear
      Of a maid by her lover lying--
    As round her fell her long fair hair,
    And she looked to Heaven with that frenzied air                      70
    Which seemed to ask if a God were there!
    And stretched by the wall of a ruined hut,
    With its hollow cheek, and eyes half shut,
      A child of Famine dying:
    And the carnage _begun_, when _resistance_ is done,
      And the fall of the vainly flying!

                                  9.

    Then he gazed on a town by besiegers taken,
      Nor cared he who were winning;
    But he saw an old maid, for years forsaken,
      Get up and leave her spinning;                                     80
    And she looked in her glass, and to one that did pass,
    She said--"pray are the rapes beginning?"[39]

                                 10.

    But the Devil has reached our cliffs so white,
      And what did he there, I pray?
    If his eyes were good, he but saw by night
      What we see every day;
    But he made a tour and kept a journal
    Of all the wondrous sights nocturnal,
    And he sold it in shares to the _Men_ of the _Row_,
    Who bid pretty well--but they _cheated_ him, though!                 90

                                 11.

    The Devil first saw, as he thought, the _Mail_,
      Its coachman and his coat;
    So instead of a pistol he cocked his tail,
      And seized him by the throat;
    "Aha!" quoth he, "what have we here?
    'T is a new barouche, and an ancient peer!"[40]

                                 12.

    So he sat him on his box again,
      And bade him have no fear,
    But be true to his club, and staunch to his rein,
      His brothel and his beer;                                         100
    "Next to seeing a Lord at the Council board,
    I would rather see him here."

                                 13.

    Satan hired a horse and gig
      With promises to pay;
    And he pawned his horns for a spruce new wig,
      To redeem as he came away:
    And he whistled some tune, a waltz or a jig,
      And drove off at the close of day.

                                 14.

    The first place he stopped at--he heard the Psalm
      That rung from a Methodist Chapel:                                110
    "'T is the best sound I've heard," quoth he, "since my palm
      Presented Eve her apple!
    When _Faith_ is all, 't is an excellent sign,
    That the _Works_ and Workmen both are mine."

                                 15.

    He passed Tommy Tyrwhitt,[41] that standing jest,
      To princely wit a Martyr:
    But the last joke of all was by far the best,
      When he sailed away with "the Garter"!
    "And"--quoth Satan--"this Embassy's worthy my sight,
    Should I see nothing else to amuse me to night.                     120
    With no one to bear it, but Thomas a Tyrwhitt,
    This ribband belongs to an 'Order of Merit'!"

                                 16.

    He stopped at an Inn and stepped within
      The Bar and read the "Times;"
    And never such a treat, as--the epistle of one "Vetus,"[42]
      Had he found save in downright crimes:
    "Though I doubt if this drivelling encomiast of War
    Ever saw a field fought, or felt a scar,
    Yet his fame shall go farther than he can guess,
    For I'll keep him a place in my _hottest Press_;                    130
    And his works shall be bound in Morocco _d'Enfer_,
    And lettered behind with his _Nom de Guerre_."

                                 17.

    The Devil gat next to Westminster,
      And he turned to "the room" of the Commons;
    But he heard as he purposed to enter in there,
      That "the Lords" had received a summons;
    And he thought, as "a _quondam_ Aristocrat,"
    He might peep at the Peers, though to _hear_ them were flat;
    And he walked up the House so like one of his own,
    That they say that he stood pretty near the throne.                 140

                                 18.

    He saw the Lord Liverpool seemingly wise,
      The Lord Westmoreland certainly silly,
    And Jockey of Norfolk--a man of some size--
      And Chatham, so like his friend Billy;[43]
    And he saw the tears in Lord Eldon's eyes,
      Because the Catholics would _not_ rise,
      In spite of his prayers and his prophecies;
    And he heard--which set Satan himself a staring--
    A certain Chief Justice say something like _swearing_.[44]
    And the Devil was shocked--and quoth he, "I must go,                150
    For I find we have much better manners below.
    If thus he harangues when he passes my border,
    I shall hint to friend Moloch to call him to order."

                                 19.

    Then the Devil went down to the humbler House,
      Where he readily found his way
    As natural to him as its hole to a Mouse,
      He had been there many a day;
    And many a vote and soul and job he
      Had bid for and carried away from the Lobby:
    But there now was a "call" and accomplished debaters                160
    Appeared in the glory of hats, boots and gaiters--
    _Some_ paid rather more--but _all_ worse dressed
          than Waiters!

                                 20.

    There was Canning for War, and Whitbread for peace,
      And others as suited their fancies;
    But all were agreed that our debts should increase
      Excepting the Demagogue Francis.
    That rogue! how could Westminster chuse him again
      To leaven the virtue of these honest men!
    But the Devil remained till the Break of Day
      Blushed upon Sleep and Lord Castlereagh:[45]                      170
    Then up half the house got, and Satan got up
      With the drowsy to snore--or the hungry to sup:--
    But so torpid the power of some speakers, 't is said,
    That they sent even him to his brimstone bed.

                                 21.

    He had seen George Rose--but George was grown dumb,
       And only lied in thought![46]
    And the Devil has all the pleasure to come
      Of hearing him talk as he ought.
    With the falsest of tongues, the sincerest of men--
      His veracity were but deceit--                                    180
    And Nature must first have unmade him again,
    Ere his breast or his face, or his tongue, or his pen,
    Conceived--uttered--looked--or wrote down letters ten,
    Which Truth would acknowledge complete.

                                 22.

    Satan next took the army list in hand,
      Where he found a new "Field Marshal;"
    And when he saw this high command
      Conferred on his Highness of Cumberland,[47]
    "Oh! were I prone to cavil--or were I not the Devil,
      I should say this was somewhat partial;                           190
    Since the only wounds that this Warrior gat,
    Were from God knows whom--and the Devil knows what!"

                                 23.

    He then popped his head in a royal Ball,
      And saw all the Haram so hoary;
    And who there besides but Corinna de Stael![48]
      Turned Methodist and Tory!
    "Aye--Aye"--quoth he--"'t is the way with them all,
      When Wits grow tired of Glory:
    But thanks to the weakness, that thus could pervert her,
    Since the dearest of prizes to me's a deserter:                     200
    _Mem_--whenever a sudden conversion I want,
    To send to the school of Philosopher Kant;
    And whenever I need a critic who can gloss over
    All faults--to send for Mackintosh to write up the Philosopher."[49]

                                 24.

    The Devil waxed faint at the sight of this Saint,
      And he thought himself of eating;
    And began to cram from a plate of ham
      Wherewith a Page was retreating--
    Having nothing else to do (for "the friends" each so near
      Had sold all their souls long before),                            210
    As he swallowed down the bacon he wished himself a Jew
      For the sake of another crime more:
    For Sinning itself is but half a recreation,
    Unless it ensures most infallible Damnation.

                                 25.

    But he turned him about, for he heard a sound
      Which even his ear found faults in;
    For whirling above--underneath--and around--
      Were his fairest Disciples Waltzing![50]
    And quoth he--"though this be--the _premier pas_ to me,
      Against it I would warn all--                                     220
    Should I introduce these revels among my younger devils,
      They would all turn perfectly carnal:
    And though fond of the flesh--yet I never could bear it
    Should quite in my kingdom get the upper hand of Spirit."

                                 26.

    The Devil (but 't was over) had been vastly glad
      To see the new Drury Lane,
    And yet he might have been rather mad
      To see it rebuilt in vain;
    And had he beheld their "Nourjahad,"[51]
      Would never have gone again:                                      230
    And Satan had taken it much amiss,
    They should fasten such a piece on a friend of his--
    Though he knew that his works were somewhat sad,
    He never had found them _quite_ so bad:
    For this was "the book" which, of yore, Job, sorely smitten,
    Said, "Oh that _mine_ enemy, _mine_ enemy had written"!

                                 27.

    Then he found sixty scribblers in separate cells,[52]
      And marvelled what they were doing,
    For they looked like little fiends in their own little hells,
      Damnation for others brewing--                                    240
    Though their paper seemed to shrink, from the heat of their ink,
      They were only _coolly_ reviewing!
    And as one of them wrote down the pronoun "_We_,"
      "That Plural"--says Satan--"means _him_ and _me_,
    With the Editor added to make up the three
    Of an Athanasian Trinity,
    And render the believers in our 'Articles' sensible,
    How many must combine to form _one_ Incomprehensible"!

                                                       _December_ 9, 1813.

FOOTNOTES:

[ii] The Devil's Drive. _A Sequel to Porson's_ Devil's Walk.--[MS. H.]

[34] ["I have lately written a wild, rambling, unfinished rhapsody,
called 'The Devil's Drive,' the notion of which I took from Porson's
_Devil's Walk_."--_Journal_, December 17, 18, 1813, _Letters_, 1898, ii.
378. "Though with a good deal of vigour and imagination, it is," says
Moore, "for the most part rather clumsily executed, wanting the point
and condensation of those clever verses of Coleridge and Southey, which
Lord Byron, adopting a notion long prevalent, has attributed to Porson."
The _Devil's Walk_ was published in the _Morning Post_, September 6,
1799. It has been published under Porson's name (1830, ed. H. Montague,
illustrated by Cruikshank). (See _Poetical Works_, 1898, i. 30, _note_
1.)]

[35] [Lord Yarmouth, nicknamed "Red Herrings," the eldest son of the
Regent's elderly favourite, the Marchioness of Hertford (the "Marchesa"
of the _Twopenny Post-Bag_), lived at No. 7, Seamore Place, Mayfair.
Compare Moore's "Epigram:" "'I want the Court Guide,' said my lady, 'to
look If the House, Seymour Place, be at 30 or 20,'" etc.--_Poetical
Works_, 1850, p. 165.]

[36] [The allusion may be to a case which was before the courts, the
Attorney-General _v_. William Carver and Brownlow Bishop of Winchester
(see _Morning Chronicle_, November 17, 1813). Carver held certain
premises under the Bishop of Winchester, at the entrance of Portsmouth
Harbour, which obstructed the efflux and reflux of the tide. "The fact,"
said Mr. Serjeant Lens, in opening the case for the Crown, "was of great
magnitude to the entire nation, since it effected the security, and even
the existence of one of the principal harbours of Great Britain."]

[37] [The Russian and Austrian troops at the battle of Leipsic, October
16, 1813, were, for the most part, veterans, while the Prussian
contingent included a large body of militia.]

[38] [For the incident of the "broken bridge" Byron was indebted to the
pages of the _Morning Chronicle_ of November 8, 1813, "Paris Papers,
October 30"--

"The Emperor had ordered the engineers to form fougades under the grand
bridge which is between Leipsic and Lindenau, in order to blow it up at
the latest moment, and thus to retard the march of the enemy and give
time to our baggage to file off. General Dulauloy had entrusted the
operation to Colonel Montford. The Colonel, instead of remaining on the
spot to direct it, and to give the signal, ordered a corporal and four
sappers to blow up the bridge the instant the enemy should appear. The
corporal, an ignorant fellow, and ill comprehending the nature of the
duty with which he was charged, upon hearing the first shot discharged
from the ramparts of the city, set fire to the fougades and blew up the
bridge. A part of the army was still on the other side, with a park of
80 pieces of artillery and some hundreds of waggons. The advance of this
part of the army, who were approaching the bridge, seeing it blow up,
conceived it was in the power of the enemy. A cry of dismay spread from
rank to rank. 'The enemy are close upon our rear, and the bridges are
destroyed!' The unfortunate soldiers dispersed, and endeavoured to
effect their escape as well as they could. The Duke of Tarentum swam
across the river. Prince Poniatowsky, mounted on a spirited horse,
darted into the water and appeared no more. The Emperor was not informed
of this disaster until it was too late to remedy it.... Colonel Montfort
and the corporal of the sappers have been handed over to a
court-martial."]

[39] [Compare _Don Juan_, Canto VIII. stanza cxxxii. line 4. Sir Walter
Scott (_Journal_, October 30, 1826 [1890, i. 288]), tells the same story
of "an old woman who, when Carlisle was taken by the Highlanders in
1745, chose to be particularly apprehensive of personal violence, and
shut herself up in a closet, in order that she might escape ravishment.
But no one came to disturb her solitude, and ... by and by she popped
her head out of her place of refuge with the pretty question, 'Good
folks, can you tell me when the ravishing is going to begin?'" In 1813
Byron did not know Scott, and must have stolen the jest from some older
writer. It is, probably, of untold antiquity.]

[40] [The "Four-Horse" Club, founded in 1808, was incorrectly styled the
Four-in-Hand Club, and the Barouche Club. According to the Club rules,
the barouches were "yellow-bodied, with 'dickies,' the horses bay, with
rosettes at their heads, and the harness silver-mounted. The members
wore a drab coat reaching to the ankles, with three tiers of pockets,
and mother-o'-pearl buttons as large as five-shilling pieces. The
waistcoat was blue, with yellow stripes an inch wide; breeches of plush,
with strings and rosettes to each knee; and it was _de rigueur_ that the
hat should be 3-1/2 inches deep in the crown." (See _Driving_, by the
Duke of Beaufort, K.G., 1894, pp. 251-258.)

The "ancient peer" may possibly be intended for the President of the
Club, Philip Henry, fifth Earl of Chesterfield (1755-1815), who was a
member of the Privy Council, and had been Postmaster-General and Master
of the Horse.]

[41] [Sir Thomas Tyrwhitt (_circ_. 1762-1833) was the son of the Rev.
Edmund Tyrwhitt, Rector of Wickham Bishops, etc., and nephew of Thomas
Tyrwhitt, the editor of the _Canterbury Tales_. He was Private Secretary
to the Prince of Wales, auditor of the Duchy of Cornwall (1796), and
Lord Warden of the Stannaries (1805). He was knighted May 8, 1812. He
was sent in the following year in charge of the Garter mission to the
Czar, and on that occasion was made a Knight of the Imperial Order of
St. Anne, First Class. He held the office of Gentleman Usher of the
Black Rod, 1812-1832. "Tommy Tyrwhitt" was an important personage at
Carlton House, and shared with Colonel McMahon the doubtful privilege of
being a confidential servant of the Prince Regent. Compare Letter III.
of Moore's _Twopenny Post-Bag_, 1813, p. 12. "From G.R. to the E. of
Y----th."

    "I write this in bed while my whiskers are airing,
    And M--c has a sly dose of jalap preparing
    For poor T--mm--y T--rr--t at breakfast to quaff--
    As I feel I want something to give me a laugh,
    And there's nothing so good as old T--mm--y kept close
    To his Cornwall accounts, after taking a dose!"

See _Gentleman's Magazine_, March, 1833, vol. 103, pt. i. pp. 275, 276.]

[42] ["Vetus" [Edward Sterling] contributed a series of letters to the
_Times_, 1812, 1813. They were afterwards republished. Vetus was not a
Little Englander, and his political sentiments recall the _obiter dicta_
of contemporary patriots; _e.g._ "the only legitimate basis for a
treaty, if not on the part of the Continental Allies, at least for
England herself [is] that she should conquer all she can, and keep all
she conquers. This is not by way of retaliation, however just, upon so
obdurate and rapacious an enemy--but as an indispensable condition of
her own safety and existence." The letters were reviewed under the
heading of "Illustrations of Vetus," in the _Morning Chronicle_,
December 2, 10, 16, 18; 1813. The reviewer and Byron did not take the
patriotic view of the situation.]

[43] [Robert Banks Jenkinson (1770-1828), second Earl of Liverpool, on
the assassination of Perceval, became Prime Minister, June 7, 1812; John
Fane (1759-1841), tenth Earl of Westmoreland, was Lord Privy Seal,
1798-1827; Charles Howard (1746-1815), eleventh Duke of Norfolk, known
as "Jockey of Norfolk," was a Protestant and a Liberal, and at one time
a friend of the Prince of Wales. Wraxall, _Posthumous Memoirs_, 1836, i.
29, says that "he might have been mistaken for a grazier or a butcher by
his dress and appearance." He figures _largely_ in Gillray, see _e.g._
"Meeting of the Moneyed Interest," December, 1798. John Pitt
(1756-1835), second Earl of Chatham, the hero of the abortive Walcheren
expedition, had been made a general in the army January 1, 1812. He
"inherited," says Wraxall, _ibid._, iii. 129, "his illustrious father's
form and figure; but not his mind."]

[44] [Edward Law (1750-1818), first Baron Ellenborough, Lord Chief
Justice of the King's Bench, 1802-18, was given to the use of strong
language. His temper (see Moore's "Sale of the Tools") was "none of the
best." On one occasion, speaking in the House of Lords (March 22, 1813)
with regard to the "delicate investigation," he asserted that the
accusation ["that the persons intrusted had thought fit to fabricate an
unauthorized document"] "was as false as hell;" and by way of protest
against the tedious harangues of old Lord Darnley, "I am answerable to
God for my time, and what account can I give at the day of judgment if I
stay here longer?"]

[45] [Compare Moore's "Insurrection of the Papers"--

    "Last night I toss'd and turn'd in bed,
    But could not sleep--at length I said,
    'I'll think of Viscount C--stl--r--gh,
    And of his speeches--that's the way.'"]

[46] [George Rose (1744-1818) was at this time Treasurer of the Navy.
Wraxall, who quotes the "Probationary Odes" with regard to his alleged
duplicity, testifies that he "knew him well in his official capacity,
during at least twelve years, and never found him deficient in honour or
sincerity" (_Posthumous Memoirs_, 1836, i. 148). Moore ("Parody of a
Celebrated Letter") makes the Regent conceive how shocked the king would
be to wake up sane and find "that R--se was grown honest, or
W--stm--rel--nd wiser."]

[47] [Ernest Augustus (1771-1851), Duke of Cumberland and King of
Hanover, fifth son of George III., was gazetted as Field-Marshal
November 27, 1813. His "wounds," which, according to the Duke's sworn
testimony, were seventeen in number, were inflicted during an encounter
with his valet, Joseph Sellis (? Selis), a Piedmontese, who had
attempted to assassinate the Prince (June 1, 1810), and, shortly
afterwards, was found with his throat cut. A jury of Westminster
tradesmen brought in a verdict of _felo de se_ against Sellis. The event
itself and the trial before the coroner provoked controversy and the
grossest scandal. The question is discussed and the Duke exonerated of
the charges brought against him, by J.H. Jesse, _Memoirs, etc., of
George III._, 1864, iii. 545, 546, and by George Rose, _Diaries, etc._,
1860, ii. 437-446. The scandal was revived in 1832 by the publication of
a work entitled _The Authentic Memoirs of the Court of England for the
last Seventy Years._ The printer and publisher of the work was found
guilty. (See _The Trial of Josiah Phillips for a Libel on the Duke of

most graciously received the following distinguished characters from the

[49] [In the review of Madame de Stael's _De L'Allemagne_ (_Edinburgh
Review_, October, 1813, vol. 22, pp. 198-238), Sir James Mackintosh
enlarged upon and upheld the "opinions of Kant" as creative and seminal
in the world of thought. In the same article he passes in review the
systems of Hobbes, Paley, Bentham, Reid, etc., and finds words of praise
and admiration for each in turn. See, too, a passage (p. 226) in which
he alludes to Coleridge as a living writer, whose "singular character
and unintelligible style" might, in any other country but England, have
won for him attention if not approval. His own "conversion" from the
extreme liberalism of the _Vindiciae Gallicae_ of 1791 to the philosophic
conservatism of the _Introductory Discourse_ (1798) to his lecture on
_The Law of Nature and Nations_, was regarded with suspicion by
Wordsworth and Coleridge, who, afterwards, were still more effectually
"converted" themselves.]

Frances Sheridan, _nee_ Chamberlaine, 1724-1766), was played for the
first time at Drury Lane Theatre, November 25, 1813. Byron was
exceedingly indignant at being credited with the authorship or
adaptation. (See Letter to Murray, November 27, 1813, _Letters_, 1898,

_Nourjahad_ of Drury Lane.]

is too _farouche_; but truth to say, my satires are not very
playful."--Letter to Moore, March 12, 1814, _Letters_, 1899, iii. 57-58.
Moore had written to him, "Your lines about the bodies of Charles and
Henry are, I find, circulated with wonderful avidity; even some clods in
this neighbourhood have had a copy sent to them by some 'young ladies in

The discovery "that King Charles I. was buried in the vault of King
Henry VIII.," was made on completing the mausoleum which George III.
caused to be built in the tomb-house. The Prince Regent was informed of
the circumstance, and on April 1, 1813, the day after the funeral of his
mother-in-law, the Duchess of Brunswick, he superintended in person the
opening of the leaden coffin, which bore the inscription, "King Charles,
1648" (_sic_). See _An Account of what appeared on Opening the Coffin of
King Charles the First_, by Sir H. Halford, Bart., 1813, pp. 6, 7.
Cornelia Knight, in her _Autobiography_ (1861, i. 227), notes that the
frolic prince, the "Adonis of fifty," who was in a good humour, and "had
given to Princess Charlotte the centre sapphire of Charles's crown,"
acted "the manner of decapitation on my shoulders." He had "forgotten"
Cromwell, who, as Lord Auchinleck reminded Dr. Johnson, had "gart kings

                         CONDOLATORY ADDRESS

         TO SARAH COUNTESS OF JERSEY, ON THE PRINCE REGENT'S
                RETURNING HER PICTURE TO MRS. MEE.[56]

    WHEN the vain triumph of the imperial lord,
    Whom servile Rome obeyed, and yet abhorred,
    Gave to the vulgar gaze each glorious bust,
    That left a likeness of the brave, or just;
    What most admired each scrutinising eye
    Of all that decked that passing pageantry?
    What spread from face to face that wondering air?
    The thought of Brutus[57]--for his was not there!
    That absence proved his worth,--that absence fixed
    His memory on the longing mind, unmixed;                             10
    And more decreed his glory to endure,
    Than all a gold Colossus could secure.

    If thus, fair Jersey, our desiring gaze
    Search for thy form, in vain and mute amaze,
    Amidst those pictured charms, whose loveliness,
    Bright though they be, thine own had rendered less:
    If he, that VAIN OLD MAN, whom truth admits
    Heir of his father's crown, and of his wits,
    If his corrupted eye, and withered heart,
    Could with thy gentle image bear to part;                            20
    That tasteless shame be _his_, and ours the grief,
    To gaze on Beauty's band without its chief:
    Yet Comfort still one selfish thought imparts,
    We lose the portrait, but preserve our hearts.

    What can his vaulted gallery now disclose?
    A _garden_ with all flowers--except the rose;--
    A _fount_ that only wants its living stream;
    A _night_, with every star, save Dian's beam.
    Lost to our eyes the present forms shall be,
    That turn from tracing them to dream of thee;                        30
    And more on that recalled resemblance pause,
    Than all he _shall_ not force on our applause.

    Long may thy yet meridian lustre shine,
    With all that Virtue asks of Homage thine:
    The symmetry of youth--the grace of mien--
    The eye that gladdens--and the brow serene;
    The glossy darkness of that clustering hair,[58]
    Which shades, yet shows that forehead more than fair!
    Each glance that wins us, and the life that throws
    A spell which will not let our looks repose,                         40
    But turn to gaze again, and find anew
    Some charm that well rewards another view.
    These are not lessened, these are still as bright,
    Albeit too dazzling _for a dotard's sight_;
    And those must wait till ev'ry charm is gone,
    To please the paltry heart that pleases none;--
    That dull cold sensualist, whose sickly eye
    In envious dimness passed thy portrait by;
    Who racked his little spirit to combine
    Its hate of _Freedom's_ loveliness, and _thine_.                     50

               FRAGMENT OF AN EPISTLE TO THOMAS MOORE.

    "WHAT say _I_?"--not a syllable further in prose;
    I'm your man "of all measures," dear Tom,--so here goes!
    Here goes, for a swim on the stream of old Time,
    On those buoyant supporters, the bladders of rhyme.
    If our weight breaks them down, and we sink in the flood,
    We are smothered, at least, in respectable mud,
    Where the divers of Bathos lie drowned in a heap,
    And Southey's last Paean has pillowed his sleep;
    That _Felo de se_ who, half drunk with his Malmsey,
    Walked out of his depth and was lost in a calm sea,                  10
    Singing "Glory to God" in a spick and span stanza,
    The like (since Tom Sternhold was choked) never man saw.[59]

    The papers have told you, no doubt, of the fusses,
    The fetes, and the gapings to get at these Russes,[60]--
    Of his Majesty's suite, up from coachman to Hetman,--
    And what dignity decks the flat face of the great man.
    I saw him, last week, at two balls and a party,--
    For a Prince, his demeanour was rather too hearty.
    You know, _we_ are used to quite different graces,

           *       *       *       *       *

    The Czar's look, I own, was much brighter and brisker,               20
    But then he is sadly deficient in whisker;
    And wore but a starless blue coat, and in kersey-
    mere breeches whisked round, in a waltz with the Jersey,[61]
    Who, lovely as ever, seemed just as delighted
    With Majesty's presence as those she invited.

           *       *       *       *       *

           *       *       *       *       *

etc. They have dined, and supped, and shown their flat faces in all

_Letters_, 1899, iii. 93, 94.

From June 6 to June 27, 1814, the Emperor of Russia, and the King of
Prussia were in England. Huge crowds watched all day and night outside
the Pulteney Hotel (105, Piccadilly), where the Emperor of Russia
stayed. Among the foreigners in London were Nesselrode, Metternich,
Blucher, and Platoff, Hetman of the Cossacks. The two latter were the
heroes of the mob. _Ibid_., p. 93, _note_ 1.]

              ANSWER TO----'S PROFESSIONS OF AFFECTION.

    IN hearts like thine ne'er may I hold a place
    Till I renounce all sense, all shame, all grace--
    That seat,--like seats, the bane of Freedom's realm,
    But dear to those presiding at the helm--
    Is basely purchased, not with gold alone;
    Add Conscience, too, this bargain is your own--
    'T is thine to offer with corrupting art
    The _rotten borough_[62] of the human heart.

from the Island of Elba to the palace of the Thuilleries. It seems
certainly more like a jaunt of pleasure than the progress of an invader
through a country to be gained."]



                ENDORSEMENT TO THE DEED OF SEPARATION,
                        IN THE APRIL OF 1816.

    A YEAR ago you swore, fond she!
      "To love, to honour," and so forth:
    Such was the vow you pledged to me,
      And here's exactly what 't is worth.

                    [TO GEORGE ANSON BYRON(?)[64]]

                                  1.

    AND, dost thou ask the reason of my sadness?
      Well, I will tell it thee, unfeeling boy!
    'Twas ill report that urged my brain to madness,
      'Twas thy tongue's venom poisoned all my joy.

                                  2.

    The sadness which thou seest is not sorrow;
      My wounds are far too deep for simple grief;
    The heart thus withered, seeks in vain to borrow
      From calm reflection, comfort or relief.

                                  3.

    The arrow's flown, and dearly shalt thou rue it;
      No mortal hand can rid me of my pain:
    My heart is pierced, but thou canst not subdue it--
      Revenge is left, and is not left in vain.

                                                                    ?1816.

                      SONG FOR THE LUDDITES.[65]

                                  1.

    AS the Liberty lads o'er the sea
    Bought their freedom, and cheaply, with blood,
          So we, boys, we
      Will _die_ fighting, or _live_ free,
    And down with all kings but King Ludd!

                                  2.

    When the web that we weave is complete,
    And the shuttle exchanged for the sword,
      We will fling the winding sheet
      O'er the despot at our feet,
    And dye it deep in the gore he has poured.

                                  3.

    Though black as his heart its hue,
    Since his veins are corrupted to mud,
            Yet this is the dew
            Which the tree shall renew
    Of Liberty, planted by Ludd!

                                                        December 24, 1816.

FOOTNOTES:

[65] [The term "Luddites" dates from 1811, and was applied first to
frame-breakers, and then to the disaffected in general. It was derived
from a half-witted lad named Ned Lud, who entered a house in a fit of
passion, and destroyed a couple of stocking-frames. The song was an
impromptu, enclosed in a letter to Moore of December 24, 1816. "I have
written it principally," he says, "to shock your neighbour [Hodgson?]
who is all clergy and loyalty--mirth and innocence--milk and water." See
_Letters_, 1900, iv. 30; and for General Lud and "Luddites," see

                            TO MR. MURRAY.

    TO hook the Reader, you, John Murray,
      Have published "Anjou's Margaret,"[66]
    Which won't be sold off in a hurry
      (At least, it has not been as yet);
    And then, still further to bewilder him,
      Without remorse, you set up "Ilderim;"[67]
      So mind you don't get into debt,--
    Because--as how--if you should fail,
    These books would be but baddish bail.
    And mind you do _not_ let escape
      These rhymes to _Morning Post_ or Perry,
    Which would be _very_ treacherous--_very_,
    And get me into such a scrape!
      For, firstly, I should have to sally,
      All in my little boat, against a _Galley_;
    And, should I chance to slay the Assyrian wight,
    Have next to combat with the female Knight:
    And pricked to death expire upon her needle,
    A sort of end which I should take indeed ill!

                           TO THOMAS MOORE.

                                  1.

    My boat is on the shore,
      And my bark is on the sea;
    But, before I go, Tom Moore,
      Here's a double health to thee!

                                  2.

    Here's a sigh to those who love me,
      And a smile to those who hate;
    And, whatever sky's above me,
      Here's a heart for every fate.

                                  3.

    Though the Ocean roar around me,
      Yet it still shall bear me on;
    Though a desert shall surround me,
      It hath springs that may be won.

                                  4.

    Were't the last drop in the well,
      As I gasped upon the brink,
    Ere my fainting spirit fell,
      'T is to thee that I would drink.

                                  5.

    With that water, as this wine,
      The libation I would pour
    Should be--peace with thine and mine,
      And a health to thee, Tom Moore.[74]

                                                               July, 1817.

             EPISTLE FROM MR. MURRAY TO DR. POLIDORI.[75]

    DEAR Doctor, I have read your play,
    Which is a good one in its way,--
    Purges the eyes, and moves the bowels,
    And drenches handkerchiefs like towels
    With tears, that, in a flux of grief,
    Afford hysterical relief
    To shattered nerves and quickened pulses,
    Which your catastrophe convulses.

      I like your moral and machinery;
    Your plot, too, has such scope for Scenery!                          10
    Your dialogue is apt and smart;
    The play's concoction full of art;
    Your hero raves, your heroine cries,
    All stab, and every body dies.
    In short, your tragedy would be
    The very thing to hear and see:
    And for a piece of publication,
    If I decline on this occasion,
    It is not that I am not sensible
    To merits in themselves ostensible,                                  20
    But--and I grieve to speak it--plays
    Are drugs--mere drugs, Sir--now-a-days.
    I had a heavy loss by _Manuel_--[76]
    Too lucky if it prove not annual,--
    And Sotheby, with his _Orestes_,[77]
    (Which, by the way, the old Bore's best is),
    Has lain so very long on hand,
    That I despair of all demand;
    I've advertised, but see my books,
    Or only watch my Shopman's looks;--                                  30
    Still _Ivan_, _Ina_,[78] and such lumber,
    My back-shop glut, my shelves encumber.

    There's Byron too, who once did better,
    Has sent me, folded in a letter,
    A sort of--it's no more a drama
    Than _Darnley_, _Ivan_, or _Kehama_;
    So altered since last year his pen is,
    I think he's lost his wits at Venice.

           *       *       *       *       *

           *       *       *       *       *

    In short, Sir, what with one and t' other,
    I dare not venture on another.                                       40
    I write in haste; excuse each blunder;
    The Coaches through the street so thunder!
    My room's so full--we've Gifford here
    Reading MS., with Hookham Frere,
    Pronouncing on the nouns and particles,
    Of some of our forthcoming Articles.

      The _Quarterly_--Ah, Sir, if you
    Had but the Genius to review!--
    A smart Critique upon St. Helena,
    Or if you only would but tell in a                                   50
    Short compass what--but to resume;
    As I was saying, Sir, the Room--
    The Room's so full of wits and bards,
    Crabbes, Campbells, Crokers, Freres, and Wards
    And others, neither bards nor wits:
    My humble tenement admits
    All persons in the dress of Gent.,
    From Mr. Hammond to Dog Dent.[79]

      A party dines with me to-day,
    All clever men, who make their way:                                  60
    Crabbe, Malcolm,[80] Hamilton,[81] and Chantrey,
    Are all partakers of my pantry.
    They're at this moment in discussion
    On poor De Stael's late dissolution.
    Her book,[82] they say, was in advance--
    Pray Heaven, she tell the truth of France!
    'T is said she certainly was married
    To Rocca, and had twice miscarried,
    No--not miscarried, I opine,--
    But brought to bed at forty-nine.                                    70
    Some say she died a Papist; some
    Are of opinion that's a Hum;
    I don't know that--the fellows Schlegel,[83]
    Are very likely to inveigle
    A dying person in compunction
    To try th' extremity of Unction.
    But peace be with her! for a woman
    Her talents surely were uncommon,
    Her Publisher (and Public too)
    The hour of her demise may rue--                                     80
    For never more within his shop he--
    Pray--was not she interred at Coppet?
    Thus run our time and tongues away;--
    But, to return, Sir, to your play:
    Sorry, Sir, but I cannot deal,
    Unless 't were acted by O'Neill.
    My hands are full--my head so busy,
    I'm almost dead--and always dizzy;
    And so, with endless truth and hurry,
    Dear Doctor, I am yours,                                             90
                JOHN MURRAY.

386), "Polidori has sent me his tragedy! Do me the kindness to send by
return of post a _delicate_ declension of it, which I engage faithfully
to copy."

"I never," said Byron, "was much more disgusted with any human
production than with the eternal nonsense, and _tracasseries_, and
emptiness, and ill-humour, and vanity of this young person; but he has
some talent, and is a man of honour, and has dispositions of amendment.
Therefore use your interest for him, for he is improved and improvable;"
and, in a letter to Murray, Aug. 21, 1817, "You want a 'civil and
delicate declension' for the medical tragedy? Take it."--For J.W.

(letter to Murray, June 14, 1817), "the absurd work of a clever
man."--_Letters_, 1900, iv. 134, and _note_ I.]

23, 1815, "was last night damned." See _Letters_, 1898, ii. 332, _note_

State for Foreign Affairs. He is associated with the foundation of the
_Anti-Jacobin_ and the _Quarterly Review_. In the drawing-room of
Albemarle Street, he was Murray's "chief 4-o'clock man," until his
official duties compelled him to settle at Paris.--_Letters_, 1900, iv.

                        EPISTLE TO MR. MURRAY.

                                  1.

    MY dear Mr. Murray,
    You're in a damned hurry
      To set up this ultimate Canto;[84]
    But (if they don't rob us)
    You'll see Mr. Hobhouse
      Will bring it safe in his portmanteau.

                                  2.

    For the Journal you hint of,[85]
    As ready to print off,
      No doubt you do right to commend it;
    But as yet I have writ off
    The devil a bit of
      Our "Beppo:"--when copied, I'll send it.

                                  3.

    In the mean time you've "Galley"[86]
    Whose verses all tally,
      Perhaps you may say he's a Ninny,
    But if you abashed are
    Because of _Alashtar_,
      He'll piddle another _Phrosine_.[87]

                                  4.

    Then you've Sotheby's Tour,--[88]
    No great things, to be sure,--
      You could hardly begin with a less work;
    For the pompous rascallion,
    Who don't speak Italian
      Nor French, must have scribbled by guess-work.

                                  5.

    No doubt he's a rare man
    Without knowing German
      Translating his way up Parnassus,
    And now still absurder
    He meditates Murder
      As you'll see in the trash he calls _Tasso's_.

                                  6.

    But you've others his betters
    The real men of letters
      Your Orators--Critics--and Wits--
    And I'll bet that your Journal
    (Pray is it diurnal?)
      Will pay with your luckiest hits.

                                  7.

    You can make any loss up
    With "Spence"[89] and his gossip,
      A work which must surely succeed;
    Then Queen Mary's Epistle-craft,[90]
    With the new "Fytte" of "Whistlecraft,"
      Must make people purchase and read.

                                  8.

    Then you've General Gordon,[91]
    Who girded his sword on,
      To serve with a Muscovite Master,
    And help him to polish
    A nation so owlish,
      They thought shaving their beards a disaster.

                                  9.

    For the man, "_poor and shrewd_,"[92]
    With whom you'd conclude
      A compact without more delay,
    Perhaps some such pen is
    Still extant in Venice;
      But please, Sir, to mention _your pay_.

                                 10.

    Now tell me some news
    Of your friends and the Muse,
      Of the Bar, or the Gown, or the House,
    From Canning, the tall wit,
    To Wilmot,[93] the small wit,
      Ward's creeping Companion and _Louse_,

                                 11.

    Who's so damnably bit
    With fashion and Wit,
      That he crawls on the surface like Vermin,
    But an Insect in both,--
    By his Intellect's growth,
      Of what size you may quickly determine.[94]

                                                Venice, _January_ 8, 1818.
             [First published, _Letters and Journals_, 1830, ii. 156, 157;
                stanzas 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, first published, _Letters_, 1900,
                                                             iv. 191-193.]

[85] [Murray bought a half-share in _Blackwood's Edinburgh Monthly
Magazine_ in August, 1818, and remained its joint proprietor till
December, 1819, when it became the property of William Blackwood. But
perhaps the reference is to Byron's Swiss Journal of September, 1816.]

[86] [Henry Gaily Knight (1786-1846), who was a contemporary of Byron at
Trinity College, Cambridge, was a poetaster, and, afterwards, a writer
of works on architecture. His Oriental verses supplied Byron with a
subject for more than one indifferent _jeu d'esprit_.]

[87] [_Phrosyne_, a Grecian tale, and _Alashtar_, an Arabian tale, were
published in 1817. In a letter to Murray, September 4, 1817, Byron
writes, "I have received safely, though tardily, the magnesia and
tooth-powder, _Phrosine_ and _Alashtar_. I shall clean my teeth with
one, and wipe my shoes with the other."--_Letters_, 1901, iv.]

[88] [Sotheby's _Farewell to Italy_ and _Occasional Poems_ were
published in 1818, as the record of a tour which he had taken in 1816-17
with his family, Professor Elmsley, and Dr. Playfair. For Byron's
unfinished skit on Sotheby's Tour, see _Letters_, 1900, iv. Appendix V.

years later he visited Ali Pasha (see _Letters_, 1898, i. 246, _note_ 1)
in Albania, and travelled in Persia and Turkey in the East. From 1813 to
1815 he served in the Russian Army. He wrote a _History of the Greek
Revolution_, 1832, 2 vols., but it does not appear that he was
negotiating with Murray for the publication of any work at this period.]

           ON THE BIRTH OF JOHN WILLIAM RIZZO HOPPNER.[95]

    HIS father's sense, his mother's grace,
      In him, I hope, will always fit so;
    With--still to keep him in good case--
      The health and appetite of Rizzo.

                                                      _February_ 20, 1818.
                 [First published, _Letters and Journals_, 1830, ii. 134.]

FOOTNOTES:

[95] [Richard Belgrave Hoppner (1786-1872), second son of John Hoppner,
R.A., was appointed English Consul at Venice, October, 1814. (See
_Letters_, 1900, iv. 83, _note_ I.) The quatrain was translated (see the
following poem) into eleven different languages--Greek, Latin, Italian
(also the Venetian dialect), German, French, Spanish, Illyrian, Hebrew,
Armenian, and Samaritan, and printed "in a small neat volume in the
seminary of Padua." For nine of these translations see _Works_, 1832,
xi. pp. 324-326, and 1891, p. 571. Rizzo was a Venetian surname. See W.
Stewart Rose's verses to Byron, "Grinanis, Mocenijas, Baltis, Rizzi,
Compassionate our cruel case," etc., _Letters_, iv. 212.]



                           [E NIHILO NIHIL;
                                  OR
                        AN EPIGRAM BEWITCHED.]

    OF rhymes I printed seven volumes--[96]
    The list concludes John Murray's columns:
    Of these there have been few translations[97]
    For Gallic or Italian nations;
    And one or two perhaps in German--
    But in this last I can't determine.
    But then I only sung of passions
    That do not suit with modern fashions;
    Of Incest and such like diversions
    Permitted only to the Persians,
    Or Greeks to bring upon their stages--
    But that was in the earlier ages
    Besides my style is the romantic,
    Which some call fine, and some call frantic;
    While others are or would seem _as_ sick
    Of repetitions nicknamed Classic.
    For my part all men must allow
    Whatever I was, I'm classic now.
    I saw and left my fault in time,
    And chose a topic all sublime--
    Wondrous as antient war or hero--
    Then played and sung away like Nero,
    Who sang of Rome, and I of Rizzo:
    The subject has improved my wit so,
    The first four lines the poet sees
    Start forth in fourteen languages!
    Though of seven volumes none before
    Could ever reach the fame of four,
    Henceforth I sacrifice all Glory
    To the Rinaldo of my Story:
    I've sung his health and appetite
    (The last word's not translated right--
    He's turned it, God knows how, to vigour)[98]
    I'll sing them in a book that's bigger.
    Oh! Muse prepare for thy Ascension!
    And generous Rizzo! thou my pension.

                                                         _February_, 1818.

                                          now for the first time printed.]

FOOTNOTES:

[96] [Byron must have added the Fourth Canto of _Childe Harold_ to the
complete edition of the _Poetical Works_ in six volumes. See Murray's
list, dated "Albemarle Street, London, January, 1818." The seventh
volume of the Collected Works was not issued till 1819.]

[97] [A French translation of the _Bride of Abydos_ appeared in 1816, an
Italian translation of the _Lament of Tasso_ in 1817. Goethe (see
_Letters_, 1901, v. 503-521) translated fragments of _Manfred_ in 1817,
1818, but the earliest German translation of the entire text of
_Manfred_ was issued in 1819.]

                            TO MR. MURRAY.

                                  1.

    Strahan, Tonson, Lintot of the times,[99]
    Patron and publisher of rhymes,
    For thee the bard up Pindus climbs,
                          My Murray.


                                  2.

    To thee, with hope and terror dumb,
    The unfledged MS. authors come;
    Thou printest all--and sellest some--
                          My Murray.

                                  3.

    Upon thy table's baize so green
    The last new Quarterly is seen,--
    But where is thy new Magazine,[100]
                          My Murray?

                                  4.

    Along thy sprucest bookshelves shine

    Tours, Travels, Essays, too, I wist,
    And Sermons, to thy mill bring grist;

    And Heaven forbid I should conclude,
    Without "the Board of Longitude,"[102]

between continuing to be his publisher and printing the "Navy Lists,"
and "that there was no hesitation which way he should decide: the
Admiralty carried the day." In his "Notes" to the _Conversations_
(November 2, 1824) Murray characterized "the passage about the
Admiralty" as "unfounded in fact, and no otherwise deserving of notice
than to mark its absurdity."]



         BALLAD. TO THE TUNE OF "SALLEY IN OUR ALLEY."

                                  1.

    OF all the twice ten thousand bards
      That ever penned a canto,
    Whom Pudding or whom Praise rewards
      For lining a portmanteau;
    Of all the poets ever known,
      From Grub-street to Fop's Alley,[103]
    The Muse may boast--the World must own
      There's none like pretty Gally![104]

                                  2.

    He writes as well as any Miss,
      Has published many a poem;
    The shame is yours, the gain is his,
      In case you should not know 'em:
    He has ten thousand pounds a year--
      I do not mean to vally--
    His songs at sixpence would be dear,
      So give them gratis, Gaily!

                                  3.

    And if this statement should seem queer,
      Or set down in a hurry,
    Go, ask (if he will be sincere)
      His bookseller--John Murray.
    Come, say, how many have been sold,
      And don't stand shilly-shally,
    Of bound and lettered, red and gold,
      Well printed works of Gally.

                                  4.

    For Astley's circus Upton[105] writes,
      And also for the Surry; (_sic_)
    Fitzgerald weekly still recites,
      Though grinning Critics worry:
    Miss Holford's Peg, and Sotheby's Saul,
      In fame exactly tally;
    From Stationer's Hall to Grocer's Stall
      They go--and so does Gally.


                                  5.

    He rode upon a Camel's hump[106]
      Through Araby the sandy,
    Which surely must have hurt the rump
      Of this poetic dandy.
    His rhymes are of the costive kind,
      And barren as each valley
    In deserts which he left behind
      Has been the Muse of Gally.

                                  6.

    He has a Seat in Parliament,
      Is fat and passing wealthy;
    And surely he should be content
      With these and being healthy:
    But Great Ambition will misrule
      Men at all risks to sally,--
    Now makes a poet--now a fool,
      And _we_ know _which_--of Gally.

                                  7.

    Some in the playhouse like to row,
      Some with the Watch to battle,
    Exchanging many a midnight blow
      To Music of the Rattle.
    Some folks like rowing on the Thames,
      Some rowing in an Alley,
    But all the Row my fancy claims
      Is _rowing_--of my _Gally_.

                                                    _April_ 11, 1818.[107]

                        ANOTHER SIMPLE BALLAT.

                                  1.

    MRS. WILMOT sate scribbling a play,
      Mr. Sotheby sate sweating behind her;
    But what are all these to the Lay
      Of Gally i.o. the Grinder?
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  2.

    I bought me some books tother day,
      And sent them down stairs to the binder;
    But the Pastry Cook carried away
      My Gally i.o. the Grinder.
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  3.

    I wanted to kindle my taper,
      And called to the Maid to remind her;
    And what should she bring me for paper
      But Gally i.o. the Grinder.
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  4.

    Among my researches for EASE
      I went where one's certain to find her:
    The first thing by her throne that one sees
      Is Gally i.o. the Grinder.
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  5.

    Away with old Homer the blind--
      I'll show you a poet that's blinder:
    You may see him whene'er you've a mind
      In Gally i.o. the Grinder.
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  6.

    Blindfold he runs groping for fame,
      And hardly knows where he will find her:
    She don't seem to take to the name
      Of Gally i.o. the Grinder.
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                  7.

    Yet the Critics have been very kind,
      And Mamma and his friends have been kinder;
    But the greatest of Glory's behind
      For Gally i.o. the Grinder.
          Gally i.o. i.o., etc.

                                                         _April_ 11, 1818.

                               EPIGRAM.

                  FROM THE FRENCH OF RULHIERES.[108]

    IF for silver, or for gold,
      You could melt ten thousand pimples
      Into half a dozen dimples,
    Then your face we might behold,
      Looking, doubtless, much more snugly,
      Yet even _then_ 'twould be damned ugly.

                                                        _August_ 12, 1819.
                 [First published, _Letters and Journals_, 1830, ii. 235.]

FOOTNOTES:

[108] ["Would you like an epigram--a translation? It was written on some
Frenchwoman, by Rulhieres, I believe."--Letter to Murray, August 12,
1819, _Letters_, 1900, iv. 346.

Claude Carloman de Rulhiere (1718-1791), historian, poet, and
epigrammatist, was the author of _Anecdotes sur la revolution de Russie
en l'annee_ 1762, _Histoire de l'anarchie de Pologne_ (1807), etc. His
epigrams are included in "Poesies Diverses," which are appended to _Les
jeux de Mains_, a poem in three cantos, published in 1808, and were
collected in his _Oeuvres Posthumes_, 1819; but there is no trace of the
original of Byron's translation. Perhaps it is _after_ de Rulhiere, who
more than once epigrammatizes "Une Vieille Femme."]



                            EPILOGUE.[109]

                                  1.

    THERE'S something in a stupid ass,
      And something in a heavy dunce;
    But never since I went to school
      I heard or saw so damned a fool
    As William Wordsworth is for once.

                                  2.

    And now I've seen so great a fool
      As William Wordsworth is for once;
    I really wish that Peter Bell
      And he who wrote it were in hell,
    For writing nonsense for the nonce.

                                  3.

    It saw the "light in ninety-eight,"
      Sweet babe of one and twenty years![110]
    And then he gives it to the nation
      And deems himself of Shakespeare's peers!

                                  4.

    He gives the perfect work to light!
      Will Wordsworth, if I might advise,
    Content you with the praise you get
      From Sir George Beaumont, Baronet,
    And with your place in the Excise!

                                                                     1819.

FOOTNOTES:

[109] [The MS. of the "Epilogue" is inscribed on the margin of a copy of
Wordsworth's _Peter Bell_, inserted in a set of Byron's _Works_
presented by George W. Childs to the Drexel Institute. (From information
kindly supplied by Mr. John H. Bewley, of Buffalo, New York.)

The first edition of _Peter Bell_ appeared early in 1819, and a second
edition followed in May, 1819. In Byron's Dedication of _Marino
Faliero_, "To Baron Goethe," dated October 20, 1820 (_Poetical Works_,
1891, iv. 341), the same allusions to Sir George Beaumont, to
Wordsworth's "place in the Excise," and to his admission that _Peter
Bell_ had been withheld "for one and twenty years," occur in an omitted
paragraph first published, _Letters_, 1891, v. 101. So close a
correspondence of an unpublished fragment with a genuine document leaves
little doubt as to the composition of the "Epilogue."]

Normanby, Farnham, till his death in 1835, but were sold in consequence

                        MY BOY HOBBIE O.[113]

                       New Song to the tune of

    "_Whare hae ye been a' day,
      My boy Tammy O.!
    Courting o' a young thing
      Just come frae her Mammie O._"

                                  1.

    HOW came you in Hob's pound to cool,
      My boy Hobbie O?
    Because I bade the people pull
      The House into the Lobby O.

                                  2.

    What did the House upon this call,
      My boy Hobbie O?
    They voted me to Newgate all,
      Which is an awkward Jobby O.

                                  3.

    Who are now the people's men,
      My boy Hobbie O?
    There's I and Burdett--Gentlemen
      And blackguard Hunt and Cobby O.

                                  4.

    You hate the house--_why_ canvass, then?
      My boy Hobbie O?
    Because I would reform the den
      As member for the Mobby O.

                                  5.

    Wherefore do you hate the Whigs,
      My boy Hobbie O?
    Because they want to run their rigs,
      As under Walpole Bobby O.

                                  6.

    But when we at Cambridge were
      My boy Hobbie O,
    If my memory don't err
      You founded a Whig Clubbie O.

                                  7.

    When to the mob you make a speech,
      My boy Hobbie O,
    How do you keep without their reach
      The watch within your fobby O?

                                  8.

    But never mind such petty things,
      My boy Hobbie O;
    God save the people--damn all Kings,
      So let us Crown the Mobby O!

                       Yours truly,

                  (Signed) _INFIDUS SCURRA_.

FOOTNOTES:

[113] [John Cam Hobhouse (1786-1869) (see _Letters_, 1898, i. 163,
_note_ 1) was committed to Newgate in December, 1819, for certain
passages in a pamphlet entitled, _A Trifling Mistake in Thomas Lord
Erskine's recent Preface_, which were voted (December 10) a breach of
privilege. He remained in prison till the dissolution on the king's
death, February 20, 1820, when he stood and was returned for
Westminster. Byron's Liberalism was intermittent, and he felt, or, as
Hobhouse thought, pretended to feel, as a Whig and an aristocrat with
regard to the free lances of the Radical party. The sole charge in this
"filthy ballad," which annoyed Hobhouse, was that he had founded a Whig
Club when he was an undergraduate at Cambridge. He assured Murray (see
his letter, November, 1820, _Letters_, vol. iv. Appendix XI. pp.
498-500) that he was not the founder of the club, and that Byron himself
was a member. "As for his Lordship's vulgar notions about the _mob_" he
adds, "they are very fit for the Poet of the _Morning Post_, and for
nobody else." There is no reason to suppose that Byron was in any way
responsible for the version as sent to the _Morning Post_.]

                 "MY BOY HOBBY O.

                [ANOTHER VERSION.]

        To the Editor of the _Morning Post_.

Sir,--A copy of verses, to the tune of '_My boy Tammy_,' are repeated
in literary circles, and said to be written by a Noble Lord of the
highest poetical fame, upon his quondam friend and annotator. My memory
does not enable me to repeat more than the first two verses quite
accurately, but the humourous spirit of the Song may be gathered from
these:--

                   1.

    Why were you put in Lob's pond,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    For telling folks to pull the House
      By the ears into the Lobby O!

                   2.

    Who are your grand Reformers now,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    There's me and BURDETT,--gentlemen,
      And Blackguards HUNT and COBBY O!

                   3.

    Have you no other friends but these,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    Yes, Southwark's Knight,[*] the County BYNG,
      And in the City, BOBBY O!

[*] "Southwark's Knight" was General Sir Robert Thomas Wilson
(1777-1849), who was returned for Southwark in 1818, and again in 1820;
"County Byng" was George Byng, M.P. for Middlesex; and "Bobby" was Sir
Robert Waithman (1764-1833), who represented the City of London in 1818,
but lost his seat to Sir William Curtis in 1820. All these were advanced
Liberals, and, as such, Parliamentary friends of Hobhouse.

    How do you recreate yourselves,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    We spout with tavern Radicals,
      And drink with them hob-nobby O!

                   5.

    What purpose can such folly work,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    It gives our partisans a chance
      Watches to twitch from fob-by O!

                   6.

    Have they no higher game in view,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    Oh yes; to stir the people up,
      And then to head the mob-by O.

                   7.

    But sure they'll at their ruin pause,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    No! they'd see King and Parliament
      Both d--d without a sob-by O!

                   8.

    But, if they fail, they'll be hanged up,
      My boy, HOBBY O? (_bis_)
    Why, then, they'll swing, like better men,
      And that will end the job-by O!

                        A VOLUME OF NONSENSE.

      DEAR MURRAY,--
              You ask for a "_Volume of Nonsense_,"
      Have all of your authors exhausted their store?
    I thought you had published a good deal not long since.
      And doubtless the Squadron are ready with more.
    But on looking again, I perceive that the Species
    Of "Nonsense" you want must be purely "_facetious_;"
    And, as that is the case, you had best put to press
      Mr. Sotheby's tragedies now in M.S.,
                Some Syrian Sally
                From common-place Gally,
    Or, if you prefer the bookmaking of women,
    Take a spick and span "Sketch" of your feminine _He-Man_.[115]

    WHEN a man hath no freedom to fight for at home,
      Let him combat for that of his neighbours;
    Let him think of the glories of Greece and of Rome,
      And get knocked on the head for his labours.

    To do good to Mankind is the chivalrous plan,
      And is always as nobly requited;
    Then battle for Freedom wherever you can,
      And, if not shot or hanged, you'll get knighted.

                        THE CHARITY BALL.[118]

    WHAT matter the pangs of a husband and father,
      If his sorrows in exile be great or be small,
    So the Pharisee's glories around her she gather,
      And the saint patronises her "Charity Ball!"

    What matters--a heart which, though faulty, was feeling,
      Be driven to excesses which once could appal--
    That the Sinner should suffer is only fair dealing,
      As the Saint keeps her charity back for "the Ball!"

                               EPIGRAM

               ON THE BRAZIERS' ADDRESS TO BE PRESENTED
          IN _ARMOUR_ BY THE COMPANY TO QUEEN CAROLINE.[119]

    IT seems that the Braziers propose soon to pass
    An Address and to bear it themselves all in brass;
    A superfluous pageant, for by the Lord Harry!
    They'll _find_, where they're going, much more than they carry.

Or--

    THE Braziers, it seems, are determined to pass
    An Address, and present it themselves all in brass:--
    A superfluous {pageant/trouble} for, by the Lord Harry!
    They'll find, where they're going, much more than they carry.

                                                        _January 6, 1821._
                 [First published, _Letters and Journals_, 1830, ii. 442.]

FOOTNOTES:

[119] [The allusion is explained in Rivington's _Annual Register_,
October 30, 1820 (vol. lxii. pp. 114, 115)--

"ADDRESSES TO THE QUEEN.

" ... The most splendid exhibition of the day was that of the
brass-founders and braziers. The procession was headed by a man dressed
in a suit of burnished plate armour of brass, and mounted on a handsome
black horse, the reins being held by pages ... wearing brass helmets....
A man in a complete suite of brass armour ... was followed by two
persons, bearing on a cushion a most magnificent imitation of the
imperial Crown of England. A small number of the deputation of
brass-founders were admitted to the presence of her Majesty, and one of
the persons in armour advanced to the throne, and bending on one knee,
presented the address, which was enclosed in a brass case of excellent
workmanship."--See _Letters_, 1901, v. 219, 220, _note_ 2.

In a postscript to a letter to Murray, dated January 19, 1821, he
writes, "I sent you a line or two on the Braziers' Company last week,
_not_ for publication. The lines were even worthy

    'Of ----dsworth the great metaquizzical poet,
    A man of great merit amongst those who know it,
    Of whose works, as I told Moore last autumn at _Mestri_
    I owe all I know to my passion for _Pastry_.'"

He adds, in a footnote, "_Mestri_ and _Fusina_ are the ferry trajects to
Venice: I believe, however, that it was at Fusina that Moore and I
embarked in 1819, when Thomas came to Venice, like Coleridge's Spring,
'slowly up this way.'"

Again, in a letter to Moore, dated January 22, 1821, he encloses
slightly different versions of both epigrams, and it is worth noting
that the first line of the pendant epigram has been bowdlerized, and
runs thus--

    "Of Wordsworth the grand metaquizzical poet."

                     ON MY THIRTY-THIRD BIRTHDAY.

                        JANUARY 22, 1821.[120]

    THROUGH Life's dull road, so dim and dirty,
    I have dragged to three-and-thirty.
    What have these years left to me?
    Nothing--except thirty-three.

[126] [Napoleon bequeathed to Lady Holland a snuff-box which had been
given to him by the Pope for his clemency in sparing Rome. Lord Carlisle
wrote eight (not seven) stanzas, urging her, as Byron told Medwin, to
decline the gift, "for fear that horror and murder should jump out of
the lid every time it is opened."--_Conversations_, 1824, p. 362. The
first stanza of Lord Carlyle's verses, which _teste_ Medwin, Byron
parodied, runs thus--

    "Lady, reject the gift! 'tis tinged with gore!
    Those crimson spots a dreadful tale relate;
    It has been grasp'd by an infernal Power;
    And by that hand which seal'd young Enghien's fate."

                        THE NEW VICAR OF BRAY.

                                  1.

          DO you know Doctor Nott?[127]
          With "a crook in his lot,"
    Who seven years since tried to dish up
          A neat Codi_cil_
          To the Princess's Will,[128]
    Which made Dr. Nott _not_ a bishop.

                                  2.

          So the Doctor being found
          A little unsound
    In his doctrine, at least as a teacher,
          And kicked from one stool
          As a knave or a fool,
    He mounted another as preacher.

                                  3.

          In that Gown (like the Skin
          With no Lion within)
    He still for the Bench would be driving;
          And roareth away,
          A new Vicar of _Bray_,
    Except that _his bray_ lost his living.

                                  4.

          "Gainst Freethinkers," he roars,
          "You should all block your doors
    Or be named in the Devil's indentures:"
          And here I agree,
          For who e'er would be
    A Guest where old Simony enters?

                                  5.

          Let the Priest, who beguiled
          His own Sovereign's child
    To his own dirty views of promotion,
          Wear his Sheep's cloathing still
          Among flocks to his will,
    And dishonour the Cause of devotion.

                                  6.

          The Altar and Throne
          Are in danger alone
    From such as himself, who would render
          The Altar itself
          But a step up to Pelf,
    And pray God to pay his defender.

                                  7.

          But, Doctor, one word
          Which perhaps you have heard
    "He should never throw stones who has windows
          Of Glass to be broken,
          And by this same token
    As a sinner, you can't care what Sin does.

                                  8.

          But perhaps you do well:
          Your own windows, they tell,
    Have long ago suffered censure;
          Not a fragment remains
          Of your character's panes,
    Since the Regent refused you a glazier.

                                  9.

          Though your visions of lawn
          Have all been withdrawn,
    And you missed your bold stroke for a mitre;
          In a very snug way
          You may still preach and pray,
    And from bishop sink into backbiter!"

FOOTNOTES:

[127] [George Frederick Nott (1767-1841), critic and divine, was Rector
of Harrietsham and Woodchurch, a Prebendary of Winchester and of
Salisbury. He was Bampton Lecturer in 1802, and, soon afterwards, was
appointed sub-preceptor to the Princess Charlotte of Wales. He was a
connoisseur of architecture and painting, and passed much of his time in
Italy and at Rome. When he was at Pisa he preached in a private room in
the basement story of the house in Pisa where Shelley was living, and
fell under Byron's displeasure for attacking the Satanic school, and
denouncing _Cain_ as a blasphemous production. "The parsons," he told
Moore (letter, February 20, 1820), "preached at it [_Cain_] from Kentish
Town to Pisa." Hence the apostrophe to Dr. Nott. (See _Records of
Shelley, Byron, and the Author_, by E.T. Trelawny, 1887, pp. 302, 303.)]

[128] [According to Lady Anne Hamilton (_Secret History of the Court of
England_, 1832, i. 198-207), the Princess Charlotte incurred the
suspicion and displeasure of her uncles and her grandmother, the Queen,
by displaying an ardent and undue interest in her sub-preceptor. On
being reproved by the Queen for "condescending to favour persons in low
life with confidence or particular respect, persons likely to take
advantage of your simplicity and innocence," and having learnt that
"persons" meant Mr. Nott, she replied by threatening to sign a will in
favour of her sub-preceptor, and by actually making over to him by a
deed her library, jewels, and all other private property. Lady Anne
Hamilton is not an accurate or trustworthy authority, but her extremely
circumstantial narrative was, no doubt, an expansion of the contemporary
scandal to which Byron's lampoon gave currency.]


                       LUCIETTA. A FRAGMENT.

    LUCIETTA, my deary,
    That fairest of faces!
    Is made up of kisses;
    But, in love, oft the case is
    Even stranger than this is--
    There's another, that's slyer,
    Who touches me nigher,--
    A Witch, an intriguer,
    Whose manner and figure
    Now piques me, excites me,
    Torments and delights me--

                              EPIGRAMS.

    OH, Castlereagh! thou art a patriot now;
    Cato died for his country, so did'st thou:
    He perished rather than see Rome enslaved,
    Thou cut'st thy throat that Britain may be saved!

       *       *       *       *       *

    So Castlereagh has cut his throat!--The worst
    Of this is,--that his own was not the first.

       *       *       *       *       *

    So _He_ has cut his throat at last!--He! Who?
    The man who cut his country's long ago.

                          THE CONQUEST.[129]

    THE Son of Love and Lord of War I sing;
      Him who bade England bow to Normandy,
    And left the name of Conqueror more than King
      To his unconquerable dynasty.
    Not fanned alone by Victory's fleeting wing,
      He reared his bold and brilliant throne on high;
    The Bastard kept, like lions, his prey fast,
    And Britain's bravest Victor was the last.

                        SONG TO THE SULIOTES.

                                  1.

    UP to battle! Sons of Suli
    Up, and do your duty duly!
    There the wall--and there the Moat is:
    Bouwah![131] Bouwah! Suliotes!
    There is booty--there is Beauty,
    Up my boys and do your duty.

                                  2.

    By the sally and the rally
    Which defied the arms of Ali;
    By your own dear native Highlands,
    By your children in the islands,
    Up and charge, my Stratiotes,
    Bouwah!--Bouwah!--Suliotes!


                                  3.

    As our ploughshare is the Sabre:
    Here's the harvest of our labour;
    For behind those battered breaches
    Are our foes with all their riches:
    There is Glory--there is plunder--
    Then away despite of thunder!

                   [From an autograph MS. in the possession of Mr. Murray,

[131] "Bouwah!" is their war-cry.



                          [LOVE AND DEATH.]

                                  1.

    I WATCHED thee when the foe was at our side,
      Ready to strike at him--or thee and me.
    Were safety hopeless--rather than divide
      Aught with one loved save love and liberty.

                                  2.

    I watched thee on the breakers, when the rock
      Received our prow and all was storm and fear,
    And bade thee cling to me through every shock;
      This arm would be thy bark, or breast thy bier.

                                  3.

    I watched thee when the fever glazed thine eyes,
      Yielding my couch and stretched me on the ground,
    When overworn with watching, ne'er to rise
      From thence if thou an early grave hadst found.

                                  4.

    The earthquake came, and rocked the quivering wall,
      And men and nature reeled as if with wine.
    Whom did I seek around the tottering hall?
      For thee. Whose safety first provide for? Thine.

                                  5.

    And when convulsive throes denied my breath
      The faintest utterance to my fading thought,
    To thee--to thee--e'en in the gasp of death
      My spirit turned, oh! oftener than it ought.

                                  6.

    Thus much and more; and yet thou lov'st me not,
      And never wilt! Love dwells not in our will.
    Nor can I blame thee, though it be my lot
      To strongly, wrongly, vainly love thee still.[132]

                        LAST WORDS ON GREECE.

    WHAT are to me those honours or renown
      Past or to come, a new-born people's cry?
    Albeit for such I could despise a crown
      Of aught save laurel, or for such could die.
    I am a fool of passion, and a frown
      Of thine to me is as an adder's eye.
    To the poor bird whose pinion fluttering down
      Wafts unto death the breast it bore so high;
    Such is this maddening fascination grown,
      So strong thy magic or so weak am I.

          ON THIS DAY I COMPLETE MY THIRTY-SIXTH YEAR.[133]

                                  1.

    'T IS time this heart should be unmoved,
      Since others it hath ceased to move:
    Yet, though I cannot be beloved,
                Still let me love!

                                  2.

    My days are in the yellow leaf;
      The flowers and fruits of Love are gone;
    The worm, the canker, and the grief
      Are mine alone!


                                  3.

    The fire that on my bosom preys
      Is lone[iii] as some Volcanic isle;
    No torch is kindled at its blaze--
      A funeral pile.

                                  4.

    The hope, the fear, the jealous care,
      The exalted portion of the pain
    And power of love, I cannot share,
      But wear the chain.

                                  5.

    But 't is not _thus_--and 't is not _here_--[iv]
      Such thoughts should shake my soul, nor now
    Where Glory decks the hero's bier,[v]
      Or binds his brow.

                                  6.

    The Sword, the Banner, and the Field,[vi]
      Glory and Greece, around me see!
    The Spartan, borne upon his shield,[134]
      Was not more free.

                                  7.

    Awake! (not Greece--she _is_ awake!)
      Awake, my spirit! Think through _whom_
    Thy life-blood tracks its parent lake,[vii]
      And then strike home!

                                  8.

    Tread those reviving passions down,[viii]
      Unworthy manhood!--unto thee
    Indifferent should the smile or frown
      Of Beauty be.

                                  9.

    If thou regret'st thy youth, _why live_?
      The land of honourable death
    Is here:--up to the Field, and give
      Away thy breath!

                                 10.

    Seek out--less often sought than found--
      A soldier's grave, for thee the best;
    Then look around, and choose thy ground,
      And take thy Rest.

FOOTNOTES:

[133] ["This morning Lord Byron came from his bedroom into the apartment
where Colonel Stanhope and some friends were assembled, and said with a
smile--'You were complaining, the other day, that I never write any
poetry now:--this is my birthday, and I have just finished something,
which, I think, is better than what I usually write.' He then produced
these noble and affecting verses, which were afterwards found written in
his journals, with only the following introduction: 'Jan. 22; on this
day I complete my 36^th^ year.'"--_A Narrative of Lord Byron's Last
Journey to Greece_, 1825, p. 125, by Count Gamba. In the _Morning
Chronicle_, October 29, 1824, the lines are headed, "Lord Byron's Latest
Verses," and are prefaced by the following note: "We have been indebted
to a friend for the following immortal verses, the last he ever
composed. Four of the lines have already appeared in an article in the
_Westminster Review_" ("Lord Byron in Greece," July, 1824, vol. ii. p.

I.

Beppo,/ A Venetian Story./ ROSALIND. Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: Look,
you lisp, and wear/ Strange suits; disable all the benefits of your own

have swam in a GONDOLA./ AS YOU LIKE IT, Act iv. Sc. 1./ _Annotation of
the Commentators_./ That is, been at _Venice_, which was much visited by
the young English/ gentlemen of those times, and was then what _Paris_

_Note_ (2)--Mr. S. Leicester Warren (Lord de Tabley) records the
following MS. notes inscribed in a copy of the Fifth Edition, which had
formerly belonged to James Boswell, jun., and was then in the possession
of Mr. J.R.P. Kirby, of Bloomsbury Street:--

A. A note on the abortive duel between Jeffrey and Moore is dated
November 4, 1811.

B. A note on the fly-leaf in the handwriting of James Boswell, jun.--

"This copy purports on the title-page to be the fourth edition, but is
in truth the fifth. Having pointed out to Murray, the bookseller, a
variation between the copy of the fifth edition and this, he borrowed it
from me, that he might show it to Lord Byron to have the circumstance
explained; that his lordship told him he had printed the fifth edition,
but, before its publication, having repented of the work altogether, he
determined to destroy the whole impression. But the printer, as he
observed, must have retained at least this one copy, and, by putting a
false title-page, had sold it as the fourth edition," etc.--_Notes and
Queries_, 1887, Series V. vol. vii. pp. 203, 204.

Mr. Murray's copy of the Fifth Edition contains, on the fly-leaves at
the beginning of the volume, MS. versions of (1) _The Curse of Minerva_,
pp. [i.]-[xi.]; (2) The Answer to Fitzgerald's Epigram, written at the
"Alfred," on _English Bards, etc._, p. [xv.]; and on p. xvi. the
following MS. Title-page:--

English Bards/ and Scotch Reviewers; a/ Satire/ By Lord Byron./ I had
rather be a kitten, and cry, mew!/ Than one of these same metre
ballad-mongers./ Shakspere./ Such shameless Bards we have; and yet 'tis
true,/ There are as mad, abandon'd critics too./ Pope./ Fifth Edition,/
Unpublished; with considerable additions./ London:/ Printed for James
Cawthorne,/ Cockspur Street./ 1812./

At the end of the volume a MS. version of "Lines on the Removing Lady
Jersey's Portrait from the Gallery of Beauties," is on pp. [85], [86],
and a MS. version of "On a Recent Discovery, 1813," on p. [89].

P. xiv. is headed by the following MS. note: "Lord Byron has two copies
of this work, R.C. Dallas, Esq., has likewise two copies, and Mr. Leigh
Hunt one."

_Note_ (1).--A facsimile of the Title-page (2) faces p. xii. of vol. i.
of the _Poetical Works_, 1898. It has been alleged that large-paper
copies of this edition were issued from the Newark press. It is certain
that large copies (a copy in the British Museum, cut for binding,
measures 220 X 122), printed on paper bearing a water-mark dated 1806,
were thrown upon the market at an early period, but it has not been
ascertained at what date or in what place they were printed. They are
undoubtedly deliberate forgeries. They purport, even in respect of
_errata_, to be identical with the genuine issue of 1807; but they were
not set up from the same type, and it is inconceivable that a second
issue, set up from different type and with slightly different ornaments,
was printed by Ridge for piratical purposes. To cite a few obvious
differences--in the title of the large-paper copies the first A of the
word "TRANSLATED" is printed ? [Greek: L ], and the Greek ? [Greek: n]
in ????? [Greek: ainee] and ?????? [Greek: neikei] appears as ? [Greek:
u] (not ? [Greek: n] reversed); in the Errata on the reverse of p.
xiii., [Page] "153 Note" is incorrectly given as "163 Note," and this
slip on the part of the _falsarius_ is more remarkable, as two other
errata in the Errata are carefully reproduced; in the Greek motto on p.
22 the letter ? [Greek: r] twice appears as ? [Greek: s]; and, finally,
the ornaments on pp. 1 and 187, though intended to be, are not
identical. In the Museum copy a portrait of "Lord Byron, from a sketch
taken on his leaving England," engraved by I. West, and "Published by V.
Hone, Ludgate Hill, 1819," precedes the title-page, and, together with
the binding, affords good, if not conclusive, proof that this copy was
printed before 1820.

See, for a correspondence on these L.P. copies of 1807, the _Athenaeum_,
June, 1898, pp. 694, 695.

See, too, for further interesting and conclusive evidence that the
ornament on p. 187 of the L.P. copies was not printed from the Newark
block, _Newark as a Publishing Town_, by T.M. Blagg, 1898, pp. 28-30.

_Note_ (2).--An autograph note, dated May 20th, 1812, signed "Byron," is
inserted on the fly-leaf of a large-paper copy in the Rowfant Library
(_Catalogue_, 1886, p. 144).

year").


_Hints from Horace_.

_Note_.--Two sets of proofs of a portion of _Hints from Horace_,
formerly the property of R.C. Dallas, are preserved in the British
Museum (_Eg_. 2029). Proof A consists of 100 lines of the English
translation (lines 173-272); Proof B, pp. [87]-128, consists of 272
lines of the English translation (lines 1-272) and (on opposite pages)
188 lines of the original Latin. These proof-sheets, which must have
followed proofs of the Fifth Edition of _English Bards_, _etc_., are
preceded by a Half-title, _Hints from Horace_ (Gothic characters), and
by the following subsidiary title:--

Hints from Horace:/ Being a/ Partial Imitation, in English Verse, of the
Epistle,/ "Ad Pisones de Arte Poetica;"/ And intended as a Sequel to/
English Bards and Scotch Reviewers./ [Gothic characters.] "Ergo fungar
vice Cotis, acutum/ Reddere quae ferrum valet, exsors ipsa secandi."/
Hor. De Arte Poet. 304-5./ "Rhymes are difficult things; they are
stubborn things, sir."/ Fielding's Amelia, Vol. III./ Book and Chap. V./
Athens, Franciscan Convent,/ March 12, 1811./

The publication of _Hints from Horace_ had been entrusted by Dallas to
Cawthorn in July-August, 1811. It may be gathered from various sources
(_Letters_, 1898, ii. 24, 54, 56) that Byron was at work on the proofs
as late as September 4; that by October 11 he had resolved to defer the
publication of the _Hints_; and that, accordingly on October 13, 1811,
"they stood still." It was not, however, till after the appearance of
_Childe Harold's_, _etc_. (May-June, 1812) that Byron determined to
suppress the already printed Fifth Edition of _English Bards_, and at
the same time to abandon the publication of his two other Satires. At
this time, says Dallas (_Recollections of the Life of Lord Byron_, 1898,
p. 241), "the _Hints from Horace_ was far advanced." In his
_Recollections, etc_. (pp. 104-113), he gives, by way of a "fair
specimen," 156 "lines of the still-unpublished poem; and, as these
extracts are taken from the first 211 lines, and his text corresponds
with proof B (see Poetical Works, 1898, i. 390, variants ii., iii.), it
may be inferred that Dallas transcribed them from his fragmentary
proof-sheets, and that the press was stopped at line 272. In 1830, in
his _Notices of the Life of Lord Byron_ (vol. i. pp. 263-269), Moore
printed 165 lines of the "Paraphrase;" but his selections are drawn from
lines 1-458, and it is evident that he had access to an original MS.
(_MS. M._), which is now in Mr. Murray's possession. The full text,
which follows the same MS., was first published in vol. v. pp. 273-327
of the six-volume edition of 1831 (_vide ante_, No. xliii. of "Collected
Editions").


_The Irish Avatar_.

Byron wrote the _Irish Avatar_ at Ravenna, September 16, 1821. On the
17th he sent a copy of the verses to Moore, then resident at Paris; and
on September 20 he desired Moore to get "twenty copies of the whole
carefully and privately printed off." A copy is in the possession of Mr.
H. Buxton Forman, C.B., and I am indebted to his kindness for the
following description: "The pamphlet consists of four 8vo leaves, viz.
half-title ('The Irish Avatar,' in bold capitals, with blank verse), pp.
[1], [2] + Text, pp. 3-8. The poem begins on the third page with a
dropped head, 'The Irish Avatar' again, and the first four verses. Pp.
4-7 contain six verses each, and p. 8 the remaining four, making up
thirty-two in all. The date at the end of p. 8 is 'September 16, 1821.'
There is no title-page proper; a headline, 'The Irish Avatar,' occurs on
pp. 4-8, which pages are numbered in Arabic figures in the outside
corners, and the thirty-two stanzas are also numbered in Arabic figures.
The poem is printed on a half-sheet of a peculiar fine-ribbed paper."
Twenty stanzas of _The Irish Avatar_ were printed by Medwin in
_Conversations of Lord Byron_, 1824, pp. 216-220, and in a second
edition, 1824, pp. 332-338. In a "new edition" of the _Conversations,
etc._, 1824, pp. 264-270, the entire poem, numbering thirty-two stanzas,
was published for the first time in England (see _Athenaeum_, July 27,
1901). _The Irish Avatar_ was first published by Murray in 1831 (Works,
vi. 419-425).

_Note_.--I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. Leonard L. Mackall, of
Berlin, for the substance of the following note on this work:--

"Pages 213-233 of the Anmerkungen" are devoted to an essay on the play
as a whole. This essay is evidently the "Appendix to an English Work,"
to which Byron refers in the letter accompanying the suppressed
Dedication to _Marino Faliero_. "In the Appendix to an English Work,
lately translated into German, and published at Leipzig, a judgment of
yours upon English poetry is quoted as follows: 'That in English poetry
great genius, universal power, a feeling of profundity, with sufficient
tenderness and force are to be found, but that altogether these do not
constitute poets,'" etc., etc. (see _Poetical Works_, 1901, v. 340, 341,
and _Letters_, 1900, v. 100-103). The originals of the Dedication and
Letters were conveyed to Goethe by John Murray the third, in 1830 (?
1831) (see _Goethe-Jahrbuch_, 1899, xx. pp. 31-35, where the
"Dedication" is printed in full for the first time), and are preserved
at Weimar in the "red portfolio" (cf. _Eckermann_, March 26, 1826), in
which Goethe kept all his papers connected with Byron. The "judgments"
quoted by Byron through "an Italian abstract" from Wagner's Appendix
(pp. 217-218) there read _inaccurately_ as follows: "In der Englischen
Poesie," sagt Goethe, "man findet durchaus einen grossen, tuchtigen,
weltgeubten Verstand, ein tiefes, zartes, Gemuth, ein vortreffliches
Wollen, ein leidenschaftliches Wirken ... das alles zuzammengenommen
macht noch keinen Poeten ... nach dieser Ansicht zeigen die meisten
Englischen Gedichte einen dustern Ueberdruss des Lebens." These
sentences, which should be read in the light of the context, will be
found in Goethe's _Dichtung und Wahrheit_, Th. iii. Buch. 13 (1814, now
Wirke, Weimar ed. xxviii. 213, 214), the book (_Aus meinem Leben,
Dichtung und Wahrheit_), which is held up to ridicule in the _Edinburgh
Review_, June, 1816, vol. xxvi. pp. 304-317.

_Dedication of Don Juan_.

The following note was attached to the "Dedication" which was prefixed
to the First Canto in 1833 (_Works_, 1833, xv. 101):--

"Note(1). [This 'Dedication' was suppressed in 1819, with Lord Byron's
reluctant consent; but, shortly after his death, its existence became
notorious, in consequence of an article in the _Westminster Review_,
generally ascribed to Sir John Hobhouse, and for several years the
verses have been selling in the streets as a broadside. It could
therefore serve no purpose to exclude them on the present occasion.]"
See, too, _Poetical Works_, 1903, vi. 3.

I am indebted to the kindness of Mr. H. Buxton Forman, C.B., for the
following description of one of these "broadsides," now in his
possession:--

"Single sheet foolscap 8vo, consisting of Half-title, 'Dedication/
to/Don Juan,/' with Imprint on verso ('London:/ printed by C. and W.
Reynell, Broad Street,/ Golden Square'); Title-page, 'Dedication/ to/
Don Juan./ by/ Lord Byron./ London:/ Published by Effingham
Wilson,/Royal Exchange./ 1833./' On the verso of this is a note--

"'[_Why the following Dedication did not appear with the two first
published Cantos of the Poem cannot be explained--unless the connection
between_ Mr. MURRAY _and_ Mr. SOUTHEY _sufficiently explains it_.]'

"The first page of the Text (p. 5, but not numbered) contains the
dropped head 'Don Juan./ Dedication.' and one stanza. Pp. 6-10 contain
two stanzas each, and p. 11 one. The headline 'Don Juan' runs from p. 6
to p. 11, and the stanzas are numbered in Roman capital figures. P. 12
is blank, and is followed by a Half-title, 'Notes,' with a blank verso.
The Notes occupy pp. 15 and 16, of which 15 is not numbered, but has a
dropped head, 'Notes.' Page 16 is numbered, and has the headline
'Notes.'"

NOTES.


_Note_ (1).--ON GENUINE AND SPURIOUS ISSUES OF "ENGLISH BARDS, AND
SCOTCH REVIEWERS."

Among the first who called attention to the "inextricable tangle" of the
several editions of _English Bards, and Scotch Reviewers_ was Mr.
Leicester Warren, better known as Lord de Tabley, who communicated some
notes in 1877 to _Notes and Queries_ (Series V. vol. vii. pp. 145,
etc.); but it was reserved to the late Mr. Dykes Campbell, Mr. Bertram
Dobell, and other correspondents to the _Athenaeum_ (May 5 to July 7,
1894), to point out that the problem was still farther complicated by
the existence of spurious issues of at least three out of the five or
six distinct editions of the Satire.

All editions, genuine or spurious, claim as their publisher "James
Cawthorn, British Library, No. 24 Cockspur Street," but different
printers were employed. The First Edition bears the imprint of "T.
Collins, Printer, No. 1, Harvey's Buildings, Strand;" the Second
Edition, that of "Deans and Co. Hart Street, Covent Garden;" the Third
Edition, that of "T. Collins," etc.; the Fourth Edition of 1810, that of
"T. Collins," etc.; the Fourth Edition of 1811 ("James Cawthorn and
Sharpe and Hailes"), that of "Cox, Son, and Baylis, Great Queen Street,
London." No printer's name was attached to the suppressed Fifth Edition
of 1812.

Genuine First Editions have the water-mark, "E. and P. 1804," or "E. and
P. 1805," or, possibly, no water-mark at all. A copy of the spurious
First Edition, in Mr. Murray's possession, has the water-mark, "S. and
C. Wise, 1812." In addition to at least eleven variants in punctuation,
the spurious copy prints (p. 5, line 47) "Wizzard" (p. 20 _n_.),
"M_e_deira," and, in the same note, "Anna d'Afert;" whereas the genuine
copies print correctly "Wizard," "Madeira," and "Anna d'Arfet."

A genuine copy of the Second Edition, which belonged to the late Mr.
Dykes Campbell, bears the water-mark "Budgen and Willmot, 1808." On p.
80, line 1007, "Abedeen" is misprinted for "Aberdeen;" and the same
misprint occurs in a copy of the Second Edition in the British Museum.
In all probability there was no spurious issue of the Second Edition.

Of the Third Edition (1810), copies bearing the water-mark, "E.&P.
1804," or "G.&R.T.," may be regarded as genuine--rare exceptions among a
host of forgeries which either lack a water-mark altogether or bear
water-marks of a later period. Mr. Gilbert R. Redgrave, in an article
(_The Library_, December 1, 1899, Series II. vol. i. pp. 18-25), notes
two distinct and divergent forgeries bearing the water-mark "Pine, and
Thomas, 1812." Forgery A prints "myse" for "muse" (line 4), "rove" for
"rave" (line 384), etc.; while forgery B, in a footnote to p. 30, prints
"Bowle'ss" for "Bowles's," and, at the end of p. 85, "we" for "me," and
"farther" for "further." Other copies bear the water-marks, "Allnutt,
1816," "Smith & Allnutt, 1816," "Ivy Mills, 1817," and "I.&R. Ansell,
1818." A copy of a spurious issue of the Third Edition in the British
Museum prints "crawl" for "scrawl" (line 47), and "p. 73" for "p. 85."

It has been surmised, but conclusive proof is not forthcoming, that a
so-called Fourth Edition of 1810 (1050 lines), which purports to have
been published by James Cawthorn, and bears the imprint, "_Printed by J.
Collins, Harvey's Buildings, Strand, London_," is a spurious issue. It
is practically a reprint of the Third Edition; but in some copies there
are misprints not to be found in other piracies--_e.g._ "crouds" for
"crowds" (line 269), and "alter" for "altar"(line 285).

Copies of the Fourth Edition of 1810, which may possibly be genuine,
bear a water-mark, "G.&R.T.," or are on plain paper. Copies which are
manifestly forgeries bear the water-marks, "J.X. 1810" and "W.
Pickering, 1816."

A second Fourth Edition (1052 lines), published by "James Cawthorn and
Sharp & Hailes, 1811," and printed by "Cox, Son, & Baylis," was
certainly recognized by Byron as a genuine Fourth Edition, and must have
passed through his hands, or been subject to his emendation, before it
was sent to press. Copies of this edition bear his MS. emendations of
1811-1812, and marginal notes of 1816. Genuine copies (_e.g._ Leigh
Hunt's copy, now in the Forster Collection at the South Kensington
Museum) are printed on paper bearing a water-mark, "J. Whatman, 1805."
There was, however, another issue of the Fourth Edition of 1811, printed
on plain paper. Mr. Redgrave notes certain minute differences between
these two issues. In the edition on plain paper there is a hyphen to
"Cockspur-Street" on the title-page, and the word "Street" is followed
by a comma instead of a semicolon. Again, in the plain-paper copies
"Lambe" is spelt with an _e_, and in the water-mark copies the word is
correctly spelt "Lamb." In the plain-paper copies the misprint
"Postcript" for "Postscript" is repeated, and in the copies bearing a
water-mark the word is correctly spelt "Postscript." There are other
differences in the advertisements at the end of the volume.

A spurious Fourth Edition in Mr. Murray's possession, which has been
enriched with a series of prints of persons and places, bears the
water-marks, "1811," "1814." Each page has been inserted into a folio
sheet bearing the water-mark, "J. Whatman, 1816." A full-sized octavo,
in small print (B.M. 11645 P. 15), which purports to be the Fourth
Edition of 1811, is probably spurious. It is the survival of a distinct
issue from other genuine or spurious copies of the Fourth Edition.

The spurious issues of the Third and Fourth Editions, whether they were
printed in Ireland or were secretly thrown upon the market by James
Cawthorn after Byron had definitely selected Murray as his publisher,
were designed for the general reader and not for the collector. The
issue of a spurious First Edition after the improved and enlarged
editions of 1809-11 were published, must have been designed for the
Byron enthusiast, if not the collector of First Editions.

The Grangerized Fourth Editions prepared by Mr. W.M. Tartt and Mr. Evans
in 1819, 1820, and a Third, by John Murray at about the same period,
and, more remarkable still, a copy of the Fourth Edition of 1811,
prefaced by a specially printed "List of Names mentioned in the _English
Bards, and Scotch Reviewers_" interleaved with the additions made in the
Fifth Edition (B.M.), point to the existence of a circle of worshippers
who were prepared to treat Byron's _Juvenilia_ as seriously as the
minute critics of the present generation. They seem to have been
sufficiently numerous to make piracy, if not forgery, profitable.

_Note_ (3).--THE ANNOTATED COPIES OF THE FOURTH EDITION OF 1811.

Two annotated copies of the genuine Fourth Edition of _English Bards,
etc._ [1811], with MS. corrections in Byron's handwriting, are
extant--one in Mr. Murray's possession, and a second in the Forster
Library at the South Kensington Museum. The former, which contains the
marginal comments marked "B. 1816," has been assumed to have been
prepared as a press copy for the Fifth Edition; but, as the following
collation reveals, the latter, which belonged to Leigh Hunt, represents
a fuller and later, though not a final revision. The half-title bears
the inscription, "Byron, Dec. 31^st^, 1811. N--d. A^y [_i.e._ Newstead
Abbey] B.

    "_Dum relego--scripsisse pudet--quia plurima cerno--
    Me quoque--qui feci--judice digna lini_--B. J^y 20, 1812."

and the verso the words, "Given me by the author on my birthday, Oct.
19, 1815. Leigh Hunt."

P. 5. ingen(-i-)ous. [The misprint is a note of a genuine copy.]

Lines 173, 174.

    (-Low may they sink to merited contempt-)
    (-And scorn remunerate the mean attempt.-)

    Still for stern Mammon may they toil in vain,
    And sadly gaze on Gold they cannot gain.

[This emendation is not given in the Murray copy.]

Lines 257, 258.

    So
  (-How-) well the subject suits his noble mind!
  (-"A fellow feeling makes us wond'rous kind,"-)
  He brays the Laureat of the long-eared kind!

[The Murray copy, which amends line 258 as above, leaves the "How"
unerased, but the Fifth Edition prints "So."]

Lines 323-328.

  And shows, (-dissolved in thine own tears-).
             still whimpering through threescore years.
  (-Whether in sighing-winds thou seek'st relief,-)
  (-Or consolation in a yellow leaf.-)
  Whether in equal strains thou vent'st thy grief
  O'er falling Empires or a yellow leaf.

[The Murray copy gives no emendation. The Fifth Edition adopts the first
correction, but, for the variant in lines 327, 328, reads--

  Whether thou sing'st with equal ease and grief
  The fall of Empires or a yellow leaf.]

Line 336.      All love thy (-strain-)
                               rhyme

Line 385.      Fresh fish from (-Helicon-)
                               Hippocrene

[The Murray copy adds a note: "The Fifth Edition reads Hippocrene."]

Lines 387, 388.

  (-Too much in turtle Bristol's sons delight,-)
  (-Too much o'er bowls of Rack prolong the night.-)
  Your turtle-feeder's verse must needs be flat,
  Though Bristol bloat him with the verdant fat.

[The Murray copy does not contain this emendation, which was adopted in
the Fifth Edition.

P. 36 _n._ The Hunt copy gives in MS. the note concerning Moore--"I am
informed," etc.--which is printed in the Fifth Edition. There is no
similar annotation in the Murray copy.

Line 502. For (-"ranks illustrious"-) both annotated copies read
"oat-fed phalanx."]

Lines 532, 533.

  And grateful (-to the founder of the feast,-)
  Declare his landlord (-can translate, at least.-)
  And grateful for the dainties on his plate,
  Declare his landlord can at least translate.

[The amended lines, which appeared in the Fifth Edition, are not in the
Murray copy.]

Lines 552, 553.

  While Kenny's World (-just suffered to proceed,-)
  (-Proclaims the audience very kind indeed.-)
  While Kenny's World--ah where is Kenny's wit?
                                     listless
  Tires the sad Gallery--lulls the (-listening-) pit.

[The emendation is given in both annotated copies; but the substitution
of "listless" for "listening," which is adopted in the Fifth Edition,
does not appear in the Murray copy,]

Line 563.       Let Comedy (-re-)sume
                             ass

[The correction is not given in the Murray copy.]

Line 569.       and (-Kemble-) lives to tread.
                      Siddons

[The substitution of "Siddons" for "Kemble," which dates from the Fifth
Edition, is not given in the Murray copy.]

Line 728.

  Want your (-defence-), let Pity be your screen
               plea
  Want is your plea, let Pity be your screen.

Lines 815, 816.

  The spoiler (-came; and all thy promise fair-)
  (-Has sought the grave, to sleep for ever there.-)
  The Spoiler swept that soaring Lyre away,
  Which she had sounded an immortal lay.

[The emendation appears in both the annotated copies.]

L. 903.        Let Moore (-be lewd-)
                         still sigh

[This emendation does not appear in the Murray copy, but the words ["be
lewd"] have been underscored with a pencil, and a X placed against
them.]

Line 946.

  (-And even spurns the great Scatonian prize.-)
  Even from the tempting ore of Seaton's prize.

[This emendation is given in both the annotated copies.]

Lines 965, 966.

  So sunk in dullness (-and so lost in shame-)
  (-That SMYTHE and HODGSON scarce redeem thy fame.-)
  So sunk in dullness that nor Hodgson's verse
  Can make thee better--nor poor Hewson's worse.

[This emendation is not in the Murray copy. The Fifth Edition adopts the
further correction, "So lost to Phoebus" for "So sunk in dullness."]

Line 969.       (-"is-) wove,
                  she wove.

[This correction is not in the Murray copy.]

Line 972.       ----(-justly praise-) their sires.
                ----glory in their sires.

[This emendation is not given in the Murray copy.

The Leigh Hunt copy gives twenty MS. emendations (besides "Death" for
"death," in line 820, and the alteration of "rapid" to "rabid" in the

permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to

such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:
