[11.] G   [6] Phaenias says that Philoxenus of Cythera, a poet, who was exceedingly fond of eating, once when he was dining with Dionysius, and saw a large mullet put before him and a small one before himself, took his up in his hands and put it to his ear; and, when Dionysius asked him why he did so, Philoxenus said that he was writing Galateia, and so he wished to ask the fish for some of the news in the kingdom of Nereus; and that the fish which he was asking said that he knew nothing about it, as he had been caught young; but that the one which was set before Dionysius was older, and was well acquainted with everything which he wished to know. On which Dionysius laughed, and sent him the mullet which had been set before himself. And Dionysius was very fond of drinking with Philoxenus; but when Philoxenus was detected in trying to seduce the king's mistress Galateia, he threw him into the stone quarries. [7] While there he wrote the Cyclops, constructing the fable with reference to what had happened to himself; representing Dionysius as the Cyclops, and the flute-player as Galateia, and himself as Odysseus.

[12.] G   About the time of Tiberius there lived a man named Apicius, very rich and luxurious; from whom several kinds of cheesecakes are called Apician. He spent countless sums on his belly, living chiefly at Minturnae, a city of Campania, eating very expensive crawfish, which are found in that place superior in size to those of Smyrna, or even to the crabs of Alexandria. Hearing too that they were very large in Africa, he sailed thither, without waiting a single day, and suffered exceedingly on his voyage. But when he came near the place, before he disembarked from the ship, (for his the news of his arrival had spread amongst the Africans,) the fishermen came alongside in their boats and brought him some very fine crawfish; and he, when he saw them, asked if they had any finer; and when they said that there were none finer than those which they brought, he, recollecting those at Minturnae, ordered the master of the ship to sail back the same way into Italy, without going near the land. But Aristoxenus, the philosopher of Cyrene, a real devotee of the philosophy of his country (from whom, hams cured in a particular way are called Aristoxeni), out of his prodigious luxury used to syringe the lettuces which grew in his garden with mead in the evening, and then, when he picked them in the morning, he would say that he, was eating green cheesecakes, which were sent up to him by the Earth.

[13.] G   When the emperor Trajanus was in Parthia, at a distance of many days' journey from the sea, Apicius sent him fresh oysters, which he had kept so by a clever contrivance of his own; real oysters, #  not like the sham anchovies which the cook of Nicomedes, king of the Bithynians, made in imitation of the real fish, and set before the king, when he expressed a wish for anchovies, (and he too at the time was a long way from the sea.) And in Euphron, the comic writer, a cook says:- 
  A. I am a pupil of Soterides, 
  Who, when his king was distant from the sea 
  Full twelve days' journey, and in winter's depth, 
  Fed him with rich anchovies to his wish, 
  And made the guests to marvel. 
  B. How was that? 
  A. He took a female turnip, shred it fine 
  Into the figure of the delicate fish; 
  Then did he pour on oil and savoury salt 
  With careful hand in due proportion. 
  On that he strewed twelve grains of poppy seed, 
  Food which the Scythians love; then boiled it all. 
  And when the turnip touched the royal lips, 
  Thus spake the king to the admiring guests: 
  "A cook is quite as useful as a poet, 
  And quite as wise, and these anchovies show it."

[25.] G   [14] The dances spoken of in Homer are partly those of tumblers and partly those of ball-players; the invention of which last kind Agallis, the Corcyraean authoress, who wrote on grammar, attributes to Nausicaa, paying a compliment to her own countrywoman; but Dicaearchus attributes it to the Sicyonians.  But Hippasus gives the credit of both this and gymnastic exercises to the Lacedaemonians. However, Nausicaa is the only one of his heroines whom Homer introduces playing at ball. Demoteles, the brother of Theocritus the Chian sophist was eminent for his skill in this game; and a man of the name of Chaerephanes, who once kept following a debauched young man, and did not speak to him, but prevented him from misbehaving. And when he said, "Chaerephanes, you may make your own terms with me, if you will only desist from following me;" "Do you think," said he, "that I want to speak to you?"  "If you do not," said he, "why do you follow me?" "I like to look at you," he replied, "but I do not approve of your conduct." The thing called ??????????, which appears to have been a kind of small ball, was invented by Atticus of Neapolis, the tutor in gymnastics of the great Pompeius. And in the game of ball the variation called ???????? used to be called ???????? ( phaininda ), and I think that the best of all the games of ball.

[26.] G   There is a great deal of exertion and labour in a game of ball, and it causes great straining of the neck and shoulders. Antiphanes says: 
  Wretch that I am, my neck's so stiff, 
and again Antiphanes describes the phaininda thus:- 
  [15] And so he gladly took the ball, 
  While dodging the other player; 
  He pushed it out of someone's way, 
  While raising another to his feet, 
  And all around the cries rang out: 
  "Out of bounds," "too far", "right by him", 
  "Over his head," "down below," "up in the air," 
  "Too short", or "pass back to the scrummage."

And it was called from the rapid motion of those who played, or else because its inventor, as Juba the Mauretanian says, was Phaenestius, a master of gymnastics. And Antiphanes says, 
  To play phaininda at Phaenestius' school.

And those who played phaininda paid great attention to elegance of motion and attitude; and accordingly Damoxenus says:- 
  A youth I saw was playing ball, 
  Seventeen years of age and tall; 
  From Cos he came, and well I know 
  The Gods look kindly on that spot. 
  For when he took the, ball or threw it, 
  So pleased were all of us to view it, 
  We all cried out; so great his grace, 
  Such frank good humour in his face, 
  That every time he spoke or moved, 
  All felt as if that youth they loved. 
  Sure never before had these eyes seen, 
  Nor ever since, so fair a mien 
  Had I stayed long most sad my plight 
  Had been to lose my wits outright, 
  And even now the recollection 
  Disturbs my senses' calm reflection.

Ctesibius also of Chalcis, a philosopher, was no bad player. And there were many of the friends of Antigonus the king who used to take their coats off and play ball with him. Timocrates, too, the Lacedaemonian, wrote a book on playing ball.

  * * * * *

[32.] G   [18] And lately baths too have been introduced; things which formerly men would not have permitted to exist inside a city. And Antiphanes points out their injurious character; 
  Plague take the bath! just see the plight 
  In which the thing has left me; 
  It seems to have boiled me up, and quite 
  Of strength and nerve bereft me. 
  Don't touch me, curst was he who taught a 
  Man to soak in boiling water.

And Hermippus says, 
  As to mischievous habits, if you ask my vote, 
  I say there are two common kinds of self-slaughter, 
  One, constantly pouring strong wine down your throat, 
  The other plunging in up to your throat in hot water.

But now the refinements of cooks and perfumers have increased so much, that Alexis says that even if a man could bathe in a bath of perfume he would not be content.  And all the manufactories of sweetmeats are in great vigour, and such plans are devised for intercourse between people, that some have proposed even to stuff the sofas and chairs with sponge, as on the idea that that will make the occupiers more amorous. And Theophrastus says that some contrivances are of wondrous efficacy in such matters; and Phylarchus confirms him [ Fr_35 ], by reference to some of the presents which Sandrocottus, the king of the Indians, sent to Seleucus; which were to act like charms in producing a wonderful degree of affection, while some, on the contrary, were to banish love. Music, too, has been cultivated now, in a way which is a great perversion of its legitimate use: and extravagance has descended even to our clothes and shoes.

[33.] G   But Homer, though he was well acquainted with the nature of perfume, has never introduced any of his heroes as perfumed except Paris; when he says [ Il_3'392 ], "glittering with beauty," as in another place he says [ Od_18'192 ] that Aphrodite - 
  With every beauty every feature arms, 
  Bids her cheeks glow, and lights up all her charms.

Nor does he ever represent them as wearing crowns, although by some of his similes and metaphors he shows that he knew of garlands. At all events he speaks of [ Od_10'195 ] 
  That lovely isle crowned by the foaming waves,

And again he says [ Il_13'736 ] - 
  For all around the crown of battle swells.

We must remark, too, that in the Odyssey he represents his characters as washing their hands before they partake of food. But in the Iliad there is no trace of such a custom. For the life described in the Odyssey is that of men living easily and luxuriously owing to the peace; on which account the men of that time indulged their bodies with baths and washings. [19] And that is the reason why in that state of things they play at dice, and dance, and play ball. But Herodotus is mistaken when he says [ 1.94 ] that those sports were invented in the time of Atys to amuse the people during the famine. For the heroic times are older than Atys. And the men living in the time of the Iliad are almost constantly crying out [ quoting from Pindarus ] - 
  Raise the battle cry so clear, 
  Prelude to the warlike spear.

[34.] G   Now to go back to what we were saying before. The Athenians made Aristonicus the Carystian, who used to play at ball with Alexander the king, a freeman of their city on account of his skill, and they erected a statue to him. And even in later times the Greeks considered all handicraft trades of much less importance than inventions which had any reference to amusement. And the people of Histiaea, and of Oreus, erected in their theatre a brazen statue holding a die in its hand to Theodorus the juggler. And on the same principle the Milesians erected one to Archelaus the harp-player. But at Thebes there is no statue to Pindarus, though there is one to Cleon the singer, on which there is the inscription- 
  Here does Cleon of Thebes, Pytheas' tuneful son, 
  While living oft with victory's garlands crowned, 
  Sweet linger, though on earth his race is run, 
  Even the high heavens with his name resound.

Polemon relates that when Alexander razed Thebes to the ground, one man who escaped hid some gold in the garments of this statue, as they were hollow; #  and then when the city was restored he returned and recovered his money after a lapse of thirty years. But Herodotus, the reciter of mimes, and Archelaus the dancer, according to Hegesander, were more honoured by Antiochus the king than any others of his friends. And Antiochus his father made the sons of Sostratus the flute-player his body-guards.

  * * * * *

[51.] G   [28]  The Persian king used to drink no other wine but that called the Chalybonian, which Poseidonius says is made in Damascus of Syria, from vines which were planted there by the Persians; and at Issa, which is an island in the Adriatic, Agatharchides says that wine is made which is superior to every other wine whatever. The Chian and Thasian wines are mentioned by Epilycus, who says that "the Chian and the Thasian wine must be strained." And Antidotus says,- 
  For all the ills that men endure, 
  Thasian is a certain cure; 
  For any head or stomach ache, 
  Thasian wine I always take, 
  A present, as I can't help feeling, 
  From Asclepius, the God of healing.

Clearchus speaks of,- 
  Lesbian wine, 
  Which Maron himself appears to me to have been the maker of.

And Alexis says,- 
  All wise men think 
  The Lesbian is the nicest wine to drink.

And again he says- 
  His whole thoughts every day incline 
  To drink what rich and rosy wine 
  From Thasos and from Lesbos comes, 
  And dainty cakes and sugarplums.

And again- 
  Hail, O Bromius, ever dear, 
  Who from Lesbos brings to here 
  Without charge the rosy wine; 
  He who would give one glass away, 
  Too vile on cheerful earth to stay, 
  Shall be no friend of mine.

And Ephippus says- 
  Oh how luscious, oh how fine 
  Is the Pramnian Lesbian wine! 
  All who are brave, and all who are wise, 
  Much the wine of Lesbos prize.

And Antiphanes- 
  There is good meat, and plenteous dainty cheer; 
  And Thasian wine, perfumes, and garlands here; 
  Aphrodite loves comfort; where folks are poor, 
  The merry goddess ever shuns their door.

And Eubulus- 
  In Thasian wine or Chian soak your throttle, 
  Or take of Lesbian an old cobwebbed bottle.

He speaks too of Psithian wine- 
  He gave me Psithian nectar, rich and neat, 
  To cool my thirst, and beat me on the chest.

And Anaxandrides mentions "a jar full of Psithian wine".

Athenaeus: The Deipnosophists
BOOK 3 (excerpts)

Translated by C.D.Yonge (1854). A few words and spellings have been changed.

[3.] G   [73] But Phylarchus says [ Fr_65 ] , that though Egyptian beans had never been sown before in any place, and had never produced fruit if any one had by chance sown a few, except in Egypt, still, #  in the time of Alexander the king, the son of Pyrrhus, it happened that some sprung up near the river Thyamis in Thesprotia in Epirus, in a certain marsh in that district; and for two years continuously they bore fruit and grew; and that on this Alexander put a guard over them, and not only forbade any one to pick them, but would not allow any one to approach the place; and on this the marsh dried up; and for the future it not only never produced the above-mentioned fruit, but it does not appear even to have furnished any water. #  And something very like this happened at Aedepsus. For at a distance from all other waters there was a spring sending forth cold water at no great distance from the sea; and invalids who drunk this water were greatly benefited: on which account many repaired thither from great distances, to avail themselves of the water. Accordingly the generals of king Antigonus, wishing to be economical with respect to it, imposed a tax to be paid by those who drank it: and on this the spring dried up. #  And in the Troas in former times all who wished it were at liberty to collect salt at Tragasae; but when Lysimachus became ruler there, and put a tax on it, that, too, disappeared: and as he marvelled at this, as soon as he remitted the tribute and left the place free, the salt came again.

  * * * * *

[21.] G   [81] Stesichorus also mentions the Cydonian apples, in his Helene, speaking thus :- 
  Before the king's most honoured throne, 
  I threw Cydonian apples down; 
  And leaves of myrrh, and crowns of roses, 
  And violets in purple posies.

Alcman mentions them too. And Cantharus does so likewise, in the Tereus; where he says- 
  Likening her bosom to Cydonian apples.

And Philemon, in his Clown calls Cydonian apples ????????. And Phylarchus, in the sixth book of his Histories, says [ Fr_10 ] that apples by their sweet fragrance can blunt the efficacy of even deadly poisons. At all events, he says, that some Phariacan poison having been cast into a chest still smelling from having had some of these apples stored away in it, lost all its effect and preserved none of its former power, but was mixed and given to some people who were plotted against, but that they escaped all harm. And that afterwards it was ascertained, by an investigation and examination of the man who had sold the poison; and that he felt sure that it arose from the fact of the apples having been put away in the chest.

[54.] G   [98] Such now, my friends, are Ulpianus' companions, the sophists; men who call even the thing which the Romans call miliarium, that is to say, a vessel designed to prepare boiling water in, ?????????, an oven-kettle; being manufacturers of many names, and far outrunning by many parasangs the Sicilian Dionysius: who called a virgin ????????? (from ???? and ????), because she is waiting for a husband; and a pillar ?????????? (from ???? and ??????), because it remains and is strong. And a javelin he called ??????????, because ( ?????? ????????) it is thrown against something; and mouse-holes he called ???????? mysteries, (from ?????? ???? ???) because they keep the mice. And Athanis in the first book of his History of the Affairs of Sicily, says that the same Dionysius gave an ox the name of ???????; and a pig he called ??????. #  And Alexarchus was a man of the same sort, the brother of Cassander, who was king of Macedonia, who built the city called Uranopolis. And Heracleides Lembus speaks concerning him in the seventh book of his Histories, and says, "Alexarchus, who founded the city Uranopolis, imported many peculiar words and forms of speaking into the language: calling a cock ????????, or he that crows in the morn; and a barber ???????????, or one who cuts men; and a drachma he called ???????, a piece of silver; and a choenix he called ???????????, what feeds a man for a day; and a herald he called ??????, a bawler. And once he wrote a letter to the magistrates of Cassandreia in this form:- Alexarchus, to the Primipiles of Brother's Town, joy: Our sun-fleshed yeans, I wot, and dams thereof which guard the braes whereon they were born, have been visited by the fateful dome of the gods in might, fresheting them hence from the forsaken fields."  But what that letter means I think that even the Pythian Apollo himself could hardly tell. For, as Antiphanes says, in his Cleophanes,- 
  What is it then to be a tyrant, (or 
  What would you call pursuing serious things,) 
  In the Lyceium with the sophists; by Zeus, 
  They are but thin and hungry joyless men. 
  And say the thing does not exist if now 
  It is produced; for that is not as yet, 
  [99] Nor can already be produced, which now 
  Is caused afresh. Nor if it did exist 
  Before, can it be now made to exist. 
  For there is nothing which has no existence. 
  And that which never yet has taken place, 
  Is not as if it had, since it has not. 
  For it exists from its existence; but 
  If there is no existence, what is there 
  From which it can exist? The thing's impossible. 
  And if it's self-existent, it will not 
  Exist again. And one perhaps may say, 
  Let be; whence now can that which has no being 
  Exist, what can become of it? What all this means 
  I say that even Apollo's self can't tell.

[58.] G   [100] But Lynceus the Samian, the friend of Theophrastus, was acquainted with the use of paunches when eaten with silphium sauce.  #  And accordingly, writing an account of the Banquet of Ptolemy , he says:- "A certain paunch having been brought round in vinegar and sauce." Antiphanes, too, mentions this sauce in his Unhappy Lovers, speaking of Cyrene - 
  I sail back to the self-same harbour whence 
  We previously were torn; and bid farewell 
  To all my horses, friends, and silphium, 
  And two horse chariots, and to cabbages, 
  And single-horses, and to salads green, 
  And fevers, and rich sauces.

[101] And how much better a paunch of a castrated animal is, Hipparchus, who wrote the book called The Egyptian Iliad, tells us in the following words - 
  But above all I do delight in dishes 
  Of paunches and of tripe from gelded beasts, 
  And love a fragrant pig within the oven.

And Sopater says in his Hippolytus - 
  But like a beauteous paunch of gelded pig 
  Well boiled and white, and basted with rich cheese.

And in his Physiologus he says- 
  'Tis not a well boiled slice of paunch of pig 
  Holding within a sharp and biting gravy.

And in his Silphae he says- 
  That you may eat a slice of boiled pig's paunch, 
  Dipping It in a bitter sauce of rue.

[59.] G   But the ancients were not acquainted with the fashion of bringing on paunches, or lettuces, or anything of the sort, before dinner, as is done now. At all events Archestratus, the inventor of made dishes, as he calls himself, says that pledges in drinking, and the use of ointments, are introduced after supper - 
  And always at the banquet crown your head 
  With flowing wreaths of varied scent and hue, 
  Culling the treasures of the happy earth; 
  And steep your hair in rich and reeking odours, 
  And all day long pour holy frankincense 
  And myrrh, the fragrant fruit of Syria, 
  On the slow slumbering ashes of the fire: 
  Then, when you drink, let slaves these luxuries bring- 
  Tripe, and the boiled paunch of well-fed swine, 
  Well soaked in cumin juice and vinegar, 
  And sharp, strong-smelling silphium; 
  Taste, too, the tender well-roast birds, and game, 
  Whatever may be in season. But despise 
  The rude uncivilized Sicilian mode, 
  Where men do nought but drink like troops of frogs, 
  And eat no solid seasoning. Avoid them. 
  And seek the meats which I enjoin thee here. 
  All other foods are only signs and proofs 
  Of wretched poverty: the green boiled vetch, 
  And beans, and apples, and dried drums of figs. 
  But praise the cheesecakes which from Athens come; 
  And if there are none, still of any country 
  Cheesecakes are to be eaten; also ask 
  For Attic Honey, the feast's crowning dish- 
  For that it is which makes a banquet noble. 
  Thus should a free man live, or else descend 
  Beneath the earth, and court the deadly realms 
  Of Tartarus, buried deep beneath the earth 
  Innumerable fathoms.

#  But Lynceus, describing the banquet given by Lamia, the female flute-player, when she entertained Demetrius Poliorcetes, represents the guests the moment they come to the banquet as eating all sorts of fish and meat; and in the same way, when speaking of the feast given by Antigonus the king, when celebrating the Aphrodisiac festival, and also one given by King Ptolemy, he speaks of fish as the first course; and then meat.

[1.] G   [128] Hippolochus the Macedonian, my friend Timocrates, lived in the time of Lynceus and Duris of Samos, pupils of Theophrastus the Eresian. And he had made a bargain with Lynceus, as one may learn from his letters, that if ever he was present at any very expensive banquet, he would relate to him the whole of the preparations which were made; and Lynceus in return made him the same promise. And there are accordingly some letters of each of them on the subject of banquets;  #  in which Lynceus relates the banquet which was given at Athens by Lamia the Attic female flute-player to King Demetrius, surnamed Poliorcetes, (and Lamia was the mistress of Demetrius.) And Hippolochus reports the marriage feast of Caranus the Macedonian. And we have also met with other letters of Lynceus, written to the same Hippolochus, giving an account of the banquet of King Antigonus, when he celebrated the Aphrodisian festival at Athens, and also that given by King Ptolemy. And I will show you the very letters themselves. But as the letter of Hippolochus is very scarce, I will run over to you the principal things which are contained in it, just for the sake of conversation and amusement at the present time.

[2.] G   #  In Macedonia, then, as I have said, Caranus made a marriage feast; and the guests invited were twenty in number. And as soon as they had sat down, a silver bowl was given to each of them as a present. And Caranus had previously crowned every one of them, before they entered the dining-room, with a golden chaplet, and each chaplet was valued at five pieces of gold. And when they had emptied the bowls, then there was given to each of the guests a loaf in a brazen platter of Corinthian workmanship, of the same size; and poultry, and ducks, and besides that, pigeons, and a goose, and quantities more of the same kind of food heaped up abundantly. And each of the guests taking what was set before him, with the brazen platter itself also, gave it to the slaves who waited behind him. Many other dishes of various sorts were also served up to eat. And after them, a second platter was placed before each guest, made of silver, on which again there was placed a second large loaf, and on that goose, and hares, and kids, and other rolls curiously made, and doves, and turtledoves, and partridges, and every other kind of bird imaginable, in the greatest abundance. Those also, says Hippolochus, we gave to the slaves; and when we had eaten to satiety, we washed our hands, and chaplets wore brought in in great numbers, made of all sorts of flowers from all countries, and on each chaplet a circlet of gold, of about the same weight as the first chaplet. [129] And Hippolochus having stated after this that Proteas, the descendant of that celebrated Proteas the son of Lanice, who had been the nurse of Alexander the king, was a most extraordinary drinker, as also his grandfather Proteas, who was the friend of Alexander, had been; and that he pledged every one present, proceeds to write as follows :-

[3.] G   And while we were now all amusing ourselves with agreeable trifling, some flute-playing women and musicians, and some Rhodian players on the sambuca came in, naked as I fancied, but some said that they had tunics on. And they having played a prelude, departed; and others came in in succession, each of them bearing two bottles of perfume, bound with a golden thong, and one of the crests was silver and the other gold, each holding a cotyla, and they presented them to each of the guests and then, instead of supper, there was brought in a great treasure, a silver platter with a golden edge of no inconsiderable depth, of such a size as to receive the entire bulk of a roast boar of huge size, which lay on it on his back, showing his belly uppermost, stuffed with many good things. For in the belly there were roasted thrushes, and paunches, and a most countless number of fig-peckers, and the yolks of eggs spread on the top, and oysters, and periwinkles. And to every one of the guests was presented a boar stuffed in this way, nice and hot, together with the dish on which he was served up. And after this we drank wine, and each of us received a hot kid, on another platter like that on which the boar had been served up with some golden spoons. Then Caranus seeing that we were cramped for the want of room, ordered canisters and breadbaskets to be given to each of us, made of strips of ivory curiously plaited together; and we were very much delighted at all this, and applauded the bridegroom, by whose means we wore thus enabled to preserve what had been given to us. Then chaplets were again brought to us, and another pair of cruets of perfume, one silver and one gold, of the same weight as the former pair. And when quiet was restored, there entered some men, who even in the Potfeast at Athens had borne a part in the solemnities, and with them there came in some ithyphallic dancers, and some jugglers, and some conjuring women also, tumbling and standing on their heads on swords, and vomiting fire out of their mouths, and they, too, were naked.

[4.] G   And when we were relieved from their exhibition, then we had a fresh drink offered to us, hot and strong, and Thasian, and Mendaean, and Lesbian wines were placed upon the board, very large golden goblets being brought to every one of us. And after we had drunk, a glass goblet of two cubits in diameter, placed on a silver stand, was served up, full of roast fishes of every imaginable sort that could be collected. And there was also given to every one a silver breadbasket full of Cappadocian loaves; some of which we ate and some we delivered to the slaves behind us. And when we had washed our hands, we put on chaplets; and then again we received golden circlets twice as large as the former ones, and another pair of cruets of perfume. And when quiet was restored, Proteas leaping up from his couch, asked for a cup to hold a chous; and having filled it with Thasian wine, and having mingled a little water with it, he drank it off, saying - 
 He who drinks most will be the happiest.

And Caranus said - "Since you have been the first to drink, do you be the first also to accept the cup as a gift; and this also shall be the present for all the rest who drink too." And when this had been said, at once nine of the guests rose up snatching at the cups, and each one trying to forestall the other. But one of those who were of the party, like an unlucky man as he was, as he was unable to drink, sat down and cried because he had no goblet; and so Caranus presented him with an empty goblet. [130] After this, a dancing party of a hundred men came in, singing an epithalamium in beautiful tune. And after them there came in dancing girls, some arranged so as to represent the Nereids, and others in the guise of the nymphs.

[5.] G   And as the drinking went on, and the shadows were beginning to fall, they opened the chamber where everything was encircled all round with white cloths. And when these curtains were drawn, the torches appeared, the partitions having been secretly removed by a mechanism. And there were seen Cupids, and Artemises, and Pans, and Hermae, and numbers of statues of that kind, holding torches in silver candlesticks. And while we were admiring the ingenuity of the contrivance, some real Erymanthian bears were brought round to each of the guests on square platters with golden edges, pierced through and through with silver darts. And what was the strangest thing of all was, that those of us who were almost helpless and stupefied with wine, the moment that we saw any of these things which were brought in, became all in a moment sober, standing upright, as it is said. And so the slaves crammed them into the baskets of good omen, until the usual signal of the termination of the feast sounded. For you know that that is the Macedonian custom at large parties.

And Caranus, who had begun drinking in small goblets, ordered the slaves to bring round the wine rapidly. And so we drank pleasantly, taking our present liquor as a sort of antidote to our previous hard drinking. And while we were thus engaged, Mandrogenes the buffoon came in, the descendant, as is reported, of that celebrated Straton the Athenian, and he caused us much laughter. And after this he danced with his wife, a woman who was already more than eighty years of age. And at last the tables, to wind up the whole entertainment, were brought in. And sweetmeats in plaited baskets made of ivory were distributed to every one. And cheesecakes of every kind known, Cretan cheesecakes, and your Samian ones, my friend Lynceus, and Attic ones, with the proper boxes, or dishes, suitable to each kind of confection. And after this we all rose up and departed, quite sobered, by Zeus, by the thoughts of, and our anxiety about, the treasures which we had received. But you who never go out of Athens think yourself happy when you hear the precepts of Theophrastus and when you eat thyme, and salads, and nice twisted loaves, solemnizing the Lenaean festival, and the Potfeast at the Anthesteria. But at the banquet of Caranus, instead of our portions of meat, we carried off actual riches, and are now looking, some for houses, and some for lands, and some of us are seeking to buy slaves.

[20.] G   [141] Subsequently the Lacedaemonians relaxed the rigour of this way of living, and became more luxurious. At all events, Phylarchus, in the (?) twenty-fifth book of his Histories, writes thus concerning them [ Fr_44 ] :- "The Lacedaemonians had given up assembling for the pheiditia, according to the custom of their country,[142] and whenever they met, after having had a few things brought round, for the sake of a seeming compliance with the law, other things were then prepared; couches furnished in a very expensive way and of exceeding size and all differing from one another in their adornment; so that some of the strangers who were invited used to be afraid to put their elbows on the pillows; and those who formerly used to rest on a bare bench during the whole banquet, perhaps once leaning on their elbows for a few minutes, had now come to such a pitch of luxury as I have spoken of, and to a serving up of many cups of wine, and of all sorts of food procured from all countries and dressed in every kind of luxurious way; and besides that, they had come to use foreign perfumes, and also foreign wines and sweetmeats. And the people began this fashion who lived a short time before the reign of Cleomenes, namely Areus and Acrotatus, rivalling the indulgence of the court of Persia; and they in their turn were so far exceeded by some private individuals, who lived in Sparta at that time, in their own personal extravagance, that Areus and Acrotatus appeared people of such rigid frugality as to have surpassed the most simple of their predecessors in self-denial."

[21.] G   #  But Cleomenes was a man of eminent wisdom in his discernment of matters, (although he was but a young man,) and also was exceedingly simple in his manner of life. For he, being king, and having such important affairs entrusted to his management, displayed such behaviour to any who were invited to any sacrifice, as to make them see that what they had daily prepared at home for themselves was in no respect inferior to what he allowed himself. And when many embassies were sent to him be never made a banquet for the ambassadors at an earlier hour than the regular time; and there never was anything more laid than five couches; and when there was no embassy, three couches were laid. And there were no orders issued by the regulator of the feasts, as to who should come in or who should sit down first: but the eldest led the way to the couch, unless he himself invited any one else to do so; and he was generally seen supping with his brother or with some of his friends of his own age. And there was placed on a tripod a brazen wine-cooler, and a cask, and a small silver cup holding two cotylae, and a cyathus; and the spoon was made of brass. And wine was not brought round to drink unless any one asked for it; but one cyathus was given to each guest before supper: and generally it was given to himself first; and then, when he had thus given the signal, the rest also asked for some wine. But what was served up was placed on a very common-looking table; and the dishes were such that there was neither anything left, nor anything deficient, but just a sufficient quantity for every one; so that those who were present should not feel the want of anything. For he did not think it right to receive guests as sparingly, in respect of soup and meat, as men are treated at the pheiditia; nor again, to have so much superfluity as to waste money for no purpose, exceeding all moderation and reason in the feast; for the one extreme he counted illiberal and the other arrogant. And the wine was of rather a better quality when he had any company. But while they were eating they all kept silence; but a slave stood by, holding in his hand a vessel of mixed wine, and poured out for every one who asked for it. And in the same manner, after supper there was given to each guest not more than two cyathi of wine, and this too was brought to each person as he made a sign for it. And there was no music of any kind accompanying the meal, but Cleomenes himself conversed all the time with each individual, having invited them, as it were, for the purpose of listening and talking; so that all departed charmed with his hospitality and affability. But Antiphanes, ridiculing the Lacedaemonian banquets in the style of the comic poets, in his drama which is entitled Archon, speaks as follows :- 
  [143] If you should live in Lacedaemon's walls, 
  You must comply with all their fashions there. 
  Go to their spare pheiditia for supper, 
  And feast on their black broth; and not disdain 
  To wear fierce whiskers, and seek no indulgence 
  Further than this; but keep the olden customs, 
  Such as their country does compel.

* * * * *

[26.] G   [145] But Heracleides the Cumaean, who compiled a history of Persia, in the second book of that work which is entitled Preparatory, says:- "And those who wait upon the Persian kings while they are at supper, all bathe before serving, and wear beautiful clothes; and they remain nearly half the day in attendance at the feast. But of those who are invited to eat with the king, some dine outside, and every one who chooses can see them, but some dine inside with the king: and even these do not actually eat with him; but there are two rooms opposite to one another, in one of which the king eats his meal, and in the other the guests eat theirs. And the king can see them through the curtain which is at the door; but they cannot see him. But sometimes, when there is a feast, then they all sup in one room, namely, in the same room as the king, being the large room. And when the king has a drinking party, (and he has one very often,) his guests are about a dozen in number, and when they have supped, the king by himself, and his guests by themselves, then one of the eunuchs summons those who are to drink with the king: and when they come, then they drink with him, but they do not have the same wine; also they sit on the ground and he reclines on a couch with golden feet; and when they are very drunk indeed they go away. But for the most part the king breakfasts and sups by himself: but sometimes his wife sups with him; and sometimes some of his sons do so. And at supper his concubines sing and play to him; and one of them leads, and then all the rest sing in concert.

"But the supper," he continues, "which is called the king's supper, will appear to any one who hears of it to be very magnificent; still, when it is examined into, it will turn out to be economically and carefully managed, and in the same manner as the meals of the other Persians who are in office. For the king has a thousand victims slain every day: and among them are horses and camels, and oxen, and asses, and stags, and an immense number of sheep; and a great many birds too are taken; and the Arabian ostrich (and that is a very huge animal), and geese, and cocks; and a moderate quantity of them are served up to each of the mess-mates of the king, and each of them carries away what is left for his breakfast. But the greater part of these victims and of this meat is carried out into the court to the spear-bearers and light-armed troops whom the king maintains; and in the court the masters of the feasts portion out the meat and the bread into equal portions; and as the mercenary troops in Greece receive money for their hire, so do these men receive food from the king, on account, as if it were money. And in the same way, at the courts of the other Persians, who hold high rank, all the food is placed at once upon the table; and when the mess-mates of the magistrate have finished their supper, then he who superintends the meal distributes what is left on the table (and the greater port of the bread and meat, is left) to each of the servants. And each attendant, when he has received his share, has his food for the day. [146] For the most honourable of the mess-mates (their title is ?? ?????????) never come to the king except to breakfast; because they have requested permission not to be bound to come twice in the day, in order that they themselves may be able to receive guests at their own houses."

[27.] G   But Herodotus, in his seventh book, says:- "The Greeks, who received Xerxes in hospitality, and invited him to supper, all came to the very extremity of ruin, so as to be utterly turned out of their houses; as for instance, among the Thasians, who, because of the cities which they had on the continent, received the army of Xerxes and entertained it at supper. Antipater, one of the citizens, expended four hundred talents in that single entertainment; and he placed on the tables gold and silver cups and goblets; and then the soldiers, when they departed after the supper, took them away with them. And, wherever Xerxes took two meals, dining as well as supping, that city would be utterly ruined."

And in the ninth book of his Histories, the same author tells us:- "The king provides a royal entertainment; and this is provided once every year, on the day on which the king was born. And the name of this feast is in Persian ?????, but in Greek ???????; and that is the only day that he has his head rubbed, and gives presents to the Persians."

But Alexander the Great, whenever he supped with any of his friends, as Ephippus the Olynthian relates in his book on the Deaths of Alexander and Hephaestion, expended each day a hundred minae, as perhaps sixty or seventy of his friends supped with him. But the king of the Persians as Ctesias and Dinon relate in the Histories of Persia, supped with fifteen thousand men, and there were expended on the supper four hundred talents; and this amounts in Italian money to twenty four hundred thousand [denarii]. And this sum when divided among fifteen thousand men is a hundred and sixty [denarii] of Italian money for each individual; so that it comes to very nearly the same as the expense of Alexander; for he expended a hundred minae, according to the account of Ephippus.

But Menander, in his play called Drunkenness, estimates the expense of the most sumptuous banquet at a talent, saying:- 
  Then we do not in these matters act as we should do 
  When to the gods we sacrifice; for then we go and buy 
  A sheep, an offering for the gods, for scarce ten drachmas' price. 
  And then we send for flute-players, and ointments, and perfumes, 
  And harps, and singing women, eels, and cheese, and honey too; 
  And ample jars of Thasian wine; but those can scarcely come, 
  When all together reckoned up, to a small talent's sum.

And it is as the very extravagance of expense that he has named a talent at all. And in his Morose Man he speaks as follows:- 
  See how those housebreakers do sacrifice! 
  Bearing such beds and couches, not to please 
  The gods, but their own selves. Incense is pious, 
  So is the votive cake; and this the god 
  Receives well-baked in the holy fire. 
  But they when they have offered the chump end 
  Of the spine, the gall bladder, and bones, 
  Not too agreeable or easy to eat, 
  Unto the gods, consume the rest themselves.

[28.] G   And Philoxenus of Cythera, in the play which is entitled The Supper (for he it is whom Platon the comic writer mentions in his Phaon, and not Philoxenus tho Leucadian,) mentions the following as the preparation made for a banquet:- 
  [ these verses, as recorded in the manuscripts, are barely intelligible ] 
  And then two slaves brought in a well-rubbed table, 
  [147] And then another, and another, till 
  The room was full, and then the hanging lamps 
  Beamed bright and shone upon the festive crowns, 
  And herbs, and dishes of rich delicacies. 
  And then all arts were put in requisition 
  To furnish forth a most luxurious meal. 
  Barley cakes as white as snow did fill the baskets, 
  And then were served up not coarse vulgar pots, 
  But well-shaped dishes, whose (?) well-ordered breadth 
  Filled the rich board, eels, and the well-stuffed conger, 
  A dish for the gods. Then came a platter 
  Of equal size, with dainty swordfish fraught, 
  And then fat cuttlefish, and the savoury tribes 
  Of the long hairy polypus. After this 
  (?) Another dish appeared upon the table, 
  Rival of that just brought from off the fire, 
  Fragrant with spicy odour. And on that 
  . . . 
  . . . 
  After that came a grey mullet hot 
  From the fire, the whole as large as the table, 
  . . . 
  . . . following these we had 
  Flower-leaved cakes and fresh confections 
  Sweet to the palate, and large buns of wheat, 
  Large as the plate, sweet, and round, which you 
  Do know the taste of well. And if you ask 
  What more was there, I'd speak of luscious chine, 
  And loin of pork, and head of boar, all hot; 
  Cutlets of kid, and well-boiled meat ends, 
  And ribs of beef, and heads, and snouts, and tails, 
  . . . 
  . . . 
  Then kid again, and lamb, and hares, and poultry, 
  Partridges and ring-doves were lavishly laid before us. 
  And golden honey, and clotted cream was there, 
  And cheese, which I did join with all in calling 
  Most tender fare. And when we all had reached 
  Satiety of food and wine, the slaves 
  Bore off the still full tables; and some others 
  Brought us warm water for to wash our hands.

[29.] G   And Socrates the Rhodian, in the third book of his History of the Civil War, describing the entertainment given by Cleopatra the last queen of Egypt, who married Antonius the Roman general, in Cilicia, speaks in the following manner:- "But Cleopatra having met Antonius in Cilicia, prepared him a royal entertainment, in which every dish was golden and inlaid with precious stones, wonderfully chased and embossed. And the walls," continues he, "were hung with cloths embroidered in gold and purple. And she had twelve triclinia laid; and invited Antonius to a banquet, and invited him to bring with him whatever companions he pleased. [148] And he being astonished at the magnificence of the sight, expressed his surprise; and she, smiling said that she made him a present of everything which he saw, and invited him to sup with her again the next day, and to bring his friends and captains with him. And then she prepared a banquet by far more splendid than the former one, so as to make that first one appear contemptible; and again she presented to him everything that there was on the table; and she told each of his captains to take for his own the couch on which he lay, and the goblets which were set before each couch. And when they were departing she gave to all those of the highest rank litters, with the slaves for litter-bearers; and to the rest she gave horses, adorned with silver-plated trappings: and to every one she gave Ethiopian boys, to bear torches before them. And on the fourth day she paid more than a talent for roses; and the floor of the chamber for the men was strewed a cubit deep, nets being spread over the blooms." And he relates further, that "Antonius himself when he was staying at Athens, a short time after this, prepared a very superb scaffold to spread over the theatre, covered with green wood such as is seen in the caves sacred to Dionysus; and from this scaffold he suspended drums and fawn-skins, and all the other trinkets which one names in connection with Dionysus, and then sat there with his friends, getting drunk from daybreak,- a band of musicians, whom he had sent for from Italy, playing to him all the time, and all the Greeks around being collected to see the sight. And presently," continues he, "he crossed over to the Acropolis, the whole city of Athens being illuminated with lamps suspended from the roofs; and after that he ordered himself to be proclaimed as Dionysus throughout all the cities in that district."

And Gaius the emperor, surnamed Caligula because he was born in the camp, was not only called the New Dionysus, but was also in the habit of going about dressed in the entire dress of Dionysus, and be used to sit on the tribunal as judge in that dress.

[30.] G   Now a man looking at these instances which have occurred in our country before our time, may marvel at the poverty of the Greeks, especially if he sets his eyes upon the banquets which take place among the Thebans; concerning whom Cleitarchus, in the first book of his Histories relating to Alexander, speaks, and says that all their wealth, when the city was razed to the ground by Alexander, was found to amount to four hundred and forty talents, because they were mean-spirited and stingy in eating and drinking, preparing in their banquets forced-meat balls, and boiled fish and anchovies, and other small fish, and sausages, and ribs of beef, and soup; on which Attaginus the son of Phrynon feasted Mardonius, with fifty other Persians; a man whom Herodotus mentions in his ninth book [ 9.16 ] as having amassed an enormous amount of riches. And I think that they would never have survived, and that there was no necessity for the Greeks to fight against them at Plataea, as they would certainly have been killed by such food as that.

[33.] G   [150] But Lynceus, in his treatise on the Affairs and Constitution of Egypt, comparing the Egyptian banquets to the Persian ones, says - "When the Egyptians made an expedition against Ochus, king of Persia, and were defeated, when the king of the Egyptians was taken prisoner, Ochus treated him with great humanity, and invited him to supper. And as there was a very splendid preparation made, the Egyptian laughed at the idea of the Persian living so frugally. 'But if you wish,' said he, 'O king, to know how happy kings ought to feast, permit those cooks who formerly belonged to me to prepare for you an Egyptian supper.' And when the Persian had ordered that they should do so, when it was prepared, Ochus was delighted at the feast, and said, 'May the gods, O Egyptian, destroy you miserably for a wicked man, who could leave such a supper as this, and desire a much more frugal repast.'" But what the Egyptian feasts were like Protagorides teaches us in the first book of his treatise on the Contests at Daphne, speaking as follows :- "And the third description of suppers is the Egyptian, whose tables are not laid at all, but dishes are brought round to the guests."

[34.] G   "But among the Galatians," says Phylarchus in his sixth book [ Fr_9 ], "it is the custom to place on the tables a great number of loaves broken plentifully, and meat just taken out of the cauldrons, which no one touches without first waiting for the king to see whether he touches anything of what in served up before him." But in his third book the same Phylarchus says [ Fr_2 ] that "Ariamnes the Galatian, being an exceedingly rich man, gave notice that be would give all the Galatians a banquet every year, and that he did so, managing in this manner: he divided the country, measuring it by convenient stages along the roads; and at these stages he erected tents of stakes and rushes and osiers, each containing about four hundred men, or somewhat more, according as the district required, and with reference to the number that might be expected to throng in from the villages and towns adjacent to the stage in question. And there he placed huge cauldrons, full of every sort of meat; and he had the cauldrons made in the preceding year before he was to give the feast, sending for artisans from other cities. And he caused many victims to he slain - numbers of oxen, and pigs, and sheep and other animals - every day; and he caused casks of wine to be prepared, and a great quantity of ground corn. And not only," he continues, "did all the Galatians who came from the villages and cities enjoy themselves, but even all the strangers who happened to be passing by were not allowed to escape by the slaves who stood around, but were pressed to come in and partake of what had been prepared."

[35.] G   Xenophon also mentions the Thracian suppers in the seventh book of his Anabasis, describing the banquet given by Seuthes in the following words [ 7.3'21 ] - [151] "But when they all came to the supper, and the supper was laid so that they might all sit round in a circle, then tripods were brought to all the guests; and they were about twenty in number, all full of meat ready carved: and leavened loaves of large size were stuck to the joints of meat with skewers. And most especially were tables always placed before the guests, for that was the custom. And first of all Seuthes behaved in this manner: taking the loaves which were near him, he broke them into small pieces, and threw the pieces to whoever he chose; and he acted in the same way with the meat, leaving before himself only just as much as he could eat; and the rest also did the same, - those I mean before whom the tables were set. But a certain Arcadian, Arystas by name, a great eater, said that throwing the bread and meat about was folly; and taking a large loaf in his hand, of the size of three choenixes, and putting the meat upon his knees, made his supper in that manner. And they brought round horns of wine, and all pledged one another; but Arystas, when the cup-bearer came to him with the wine, said, as he saw that Xenophon was no longer eating any supper, 'Give him the wine, for he has time to drink it, but I have not time yet.' And then there arose laughter. And as the liquor went round, a Thracian came in, having a white horse, and taking a horn full of wine, said, 'O Seuthes, I pledge you, and I make you a present of my horse: and if you ride him you will catch whatever you wish to catch; and when you retreat you will never need to fear an enemy.' And another man brought in his son, and gave him to him in the same manner, pledging him in wine: and another gave him garments for his wife. And Timasion, pledging him, gave him a silver goblet, and a scimitar worth ten minae. But Gnesippus, an Athenian, rising up, said that there was an ancient and excellent law, that those who had anything should give it to the king as a compliment, and that the king should make presents to those who had nothing. But Xenophon rose up boldly, and taking the horn, said- 'I, O Seuthes, give you myself and than my companions to be faithful friends to you, and not one of them is unwilling that I should do so: and now they are present here asking for nothing, but being willing to encounter labour and danger on your behalf.' And Seuthes, rising up, drank to Xenophon, and spilt the rest of the contents of the horn at the same time that he did. And after this there came in men who played on horns such as are used for giving orders with, and also on trumpets made of raw bull's-hide, in excellent tune, as if they had been playing on a magadis."

[36.] G   And Poseidonius the Stoic, in the histories which be composed in a manner by no means inconsistent with the philosophy which he professed, writing of the laws that were established and the customs which prevailed in many nations, says [ Fr_15 ] - " The Celts place food before their guests, putting grass for their seats, and they serve it up on wooden tables raised a very little above the ground; and their food consists of a few loaves, and a good deal of meat brought up floating in water, and roasted on the coals or on spits. And they eat their meat in a cleanly manner enough, but like lions, taking up whole joints in both their hands and gnawing them; and if there is any which they cannot easily tear away, they cut it off with a small sword which they have in a sheath in a special box. [152] And those who live near the rivers eat fish also, and so do those who live near the Mediterranean sea, or near the Atlantic ocean; and they eat it roasted with salt and vinegar and cumin seed: and cumin seed they also throw into their wine. But they use no oil, on account of its scarcity; and because they are not used to it, it seems disagreeable to them.  But when many of them sup together, they all sit in a circle; and the bravest sits in the middle, like the coryphaeus of a chorus; because he is superior to the rest either in his military skill, or in birth, or in riches: and the man who gives the entertainment sits next to him; and then on each side the rest of the guests sit in regular order, according as each is eminent or distinguished for anything. And their armour-bearers, bearing their large oblong shields, called thureoi, stand behind; and their spear-bearers sit down opposite in a circle, and feast in the same manner as their masters. And those who act as cup-bearers and bring round the wine, bring it round in jars made either of earthenware or of silver, like ordinary casks in shape, and the name they give them is ???????. And their platters on which they serve up the meat are also made of the same material; but some have brazen platters, and some have wooden or plaited baskets. And the liquor which is drunk is, among the rich, wine brought from Italy or from the country about Massilia; and this is drunk unmixed, but sometimes a little water is mixed with it. But among the poorer classes what is drunk is a beer made of wheat prepared with honey, and oftener still without any honey; and they call it ?????. And they all drink it out of the same cup, in small draughts, not drinking more than a cyathus at a time; but they take frequent draughts: and a slave carries the liquor round, beginning at the right hand and going on to the left; and this is the way in which they are waited on, and in which they worship the gods, always turning towards the right hand."

[37.] G   #  And Poseidonius continuing, and relating the riches of Luernius the father of Bityis, who was subdued by the Romans, says [ Fr_18 ] that "he, aiming at becoming a leader of the populace, used to drive in a chariot over the plains, and scatter gold and silver among the myriads of Celts who followed him; and that he enclosed a fenced space of twelve furlongs in length every way, square, in which he erected wine-presses, and filled them with expensive liquors; and that he prepared so vast a quantity of eatables that for very many days any one who chose was at liberty to go and enjoy what was there prepared, being waited on without interruption or cessation. And once, when he had issued beforehand invitations to a banquet, some poet from some barbarian tribe came too late and met him on the way, and sung a hymn in which he extolled his magnificence, and bewailed his own misfortune in having come too late: and Luernius was pleased with his ode, and called for a bag of gold, and threw it to him as he was running by the side of his chariot; and that he picked it up, and then went on singing, saying that his very footprints upon the earth over which be drove produced benefits to men." Those now are the accounts of the Celts given by Poseidonius in the twenty-third book of his history.

[38.] G   But in the fifth book, speaking of the Parthians, he says [ Fr_5 ] - "But a friend who is invited does not share the same table, [153] but sitting on the ground while the king reclines near on a lofty couch, eats whatever is thrown to him from the king, like a dog. And very often he is torn away from his feast on the ground for some trifling cause, and is scourged with rods and knotted whips; and when he is all covered with blood he falls down on his face on the floor, and adores the man who has punished him as his benefactor."

#  And in his eleventh book, speaking of Seleucus the king, and relating how he came against Media, and warred against Arsaces, and was taken prisoner by the barbarian, and how be remained a long time in captivity to Arsaces, being treated like a king by him, he writes thus [ Fr_12 ] - "Among the Parthians, at their banquets, the king had a couch on which he reclined by himself higher than all the rest, and apart from them; and a table also was laid for him by himself as for a hero, laden with all sorts of barbaric delicacies." #  And when he is speaking of Heracleon of Beroea, who was promoted to honour by that king Antiochus who was surnamed Grypus, and who very nearly turned his benefactor out of his kingdom, he writes as follows in the fourth book of his histories: "He also gave entertainments to the soldiers, making them sit down on the ground in the open air by thousands and the entertainment consisted of large loaves and meat; and their drink was any sort of wine that could be got, mingled with cold water. And they were waited on by men girded with swords, and there was an orderly silence throughout the whole company."

Again, in his second book, he says [ Fr_1 ] - "In the city of the Romans when they feast in the temple of Hercules, when a general who is celebrating a triumph furnishes the entertainment, the whole preparation of the banquet is of a Herculean character; for honey-wine is served out to the guests as wine and the food consists of huge loaves, and smoked meat boiled, and also, great abundance of roast meat from the victims which have been lately slain. But among the Etruscans luxurious tables are spread twice a-day; and couches embroidered with flowers, and silver drinking cups of every sort. And a great number of well-appointed slaves is at hand, dressed in expensive garments." And Timaeus, in the first book of his Histories, says that all the female servants in that nation always wait at table naked till they are quite grown up.

[39.] G   And Megasthenes, in the second book of his Indian History, says - "Among the Indians at a banquet a table is set before each individual; and it is like a sideboard or buffet; and on the table is placed a golden dish, in which they throw first of all boiled rice, just as if a person were going to boil groats, and then they add many sorts of meat dressed after the Indian fashion."

But the Germans, as Poseidonius relates in his thirtieth book [ Fr_22 ], eat for dinner meat roasted in separate joints; and they drink milk and unmixed wine. And some of the tribes of the Campanians practise single combat at their drinking parties.  But Nicolaus of Damascus, one of the philosophers of the Peripatetic school, in the hundred-and-tenth book of his History, relates that the Romans at their feasts practise single combats, writing as follows - "The Romans used to exhibit spectacles of single combats, not only in their public shows and in their theatres, having derived the custom from the Etruscans, but they did so also at their banquets. Accordingly, peop1e often invited their friends to an entertainment, promising them, in addition to other things that they should see two or three pairs of single combatants. And when they had had enough of meat and drink, they then called in the combatants: and as soon as one of them was killed, the guests clapped, being delighted at the exhibition. [154] And in one instance a man left it in his will that some beautiful women, whom he had purchased as slaves, should engage in single combat: and in another case a man desired that some youthful boys whom he had loved should do so; but the people would not tolerate such notorious proceedings, and declared the will invalid." And Eratosthenes says, in the first book of his Catalogue of the Victors at Olympia, that the Etruscans used to box to the music of the flute.

[40.] G   But Poseidonius, in the twenty-third book of his Histories, says [Fr_16 ] - "The Celts sometimes have single combats at their entertainments. For having assembled in arms, they go through the exercise, and make feints at, and sometimes they even go so far as to wound one another. And being irritated by this, if the bystanders do not stop them, they will proceed even to kill one another. But in olden times," he continues, "there was a custom that a hind quarter of pork was put on the table, and the bravest man took it; and if any one else laid claim to it, then the two rose up to fight till one of them was slain. And other men in the theatre having received some silver or gold money, and some even for a number of earthen vessels full of wine, having taken pledges that the gifts promised shall really be given, and having distributed them among their nearest connections, have laid themselves down on doors with their faces upwards, and then allowed some bystander to cut their throats with a sword."

And Euphorion the Chalcidian, in his Historical Memorials, writes as follows - "But among the Romans it is common for five minae to be offered to any one who chooses to take it, to allow his head to be cut off with an axe, so that his heirs might receive the reward: and very often many have returned their names as willing, so that there has been a regular contest between them as to who had the best right to be beaten to death."

[41.] G   And Hermippus, in the first book of his treatise on Lawgivers, asserts that the Mantineians were the original inventors of men to fight in single combat, and that Demonax, one of their citizens, was the original suggestor of such a course; and that the Cyrenaeans were the next to follow their example. And Ephorus, in the sixth book of his History, says- "The Mantineians and Arcadians were in the habit of practising warlike exercises; and even to this day they call the military dress and the ancient fashion of arming the Mantineian, as having been invented by that people. And in addition to this, the exercises of single combat were first invented in Mantineia, Demeas being the original author of the invention." And that the custom of single combatants was an ancient one, Aristophanes shows, when he speaks thus in his Phoenissae - 
  And on the heroes twain, the sons of Oedipus, 
  Has savage Ares descended; and they now 
  Seek the arena dread of single combat.

And the word ????????? appears not to be derived from the noun ????, but rather from the verb ????????. For as often an a word compounded of ???? ends ??, as in the words ????????, ??????????, ????????, ?????????, and the ????????? race of Perseus, spoken of by Pindarus, then it is acuted on the antepenultima; but when it has the acute accent on the penultima, then the verb ???????? comes in; as is shown in the words ????????, ????????, in the expression ????? ?? ???????? ??????, in Stesichorus; and the nouns ?????????, ??????????, ??????????. But Poseidippus the comic writer, in his Pornoboscus, says - 
  The man who never went to sea has never shipwrecked been. 
  But we have been more miserable than ????????????? (gladiators in single combat).

[155] And that even men of reputation and captains fought in single combat, and did so in accordance with premeditated challenges, we have already said in other parts of this discussion. #  And Diyllus the Athenian says, in the ninth book of his Histories, that Cassander, when returning from Boeotia after he had buried the king and queen at Aegae, and with them Cynna the mother of Eurydice, and had paid them all the other honours to which they were entitled, celebrated also a show of single combats, and four of the soldiers entered the arena on that occasion.

[42.] G   #  But Demetrius of Scepsis, in the twelfth book of Trojan Array, says, that at the court of Antiochus the king, who was surnamed the Great, not only did the friends of the king dance in arms at his entertainments, but even the king himself did so. And when the turn to dance came to Hegesianax of Alexandria in the Troad, who wrote the Histories, he rose up and said- 'Do you wish, O king, to see me dance badly, or would you prefer hearing me recite my own poems very well?' Accordingly, being ordered rather to recite his poems, he sang the praises of the king in such a manner, that he was thought worthy of payment, and of being ranked as one of the king's friends for the time to come. #  But Duris the Samian, in the seventeenth book of his Histories, says that Polysperchon, though a very old man, danced whenever he was drunk,- a man who was inferior to no one of the Macedonians, either as a commander or in respect of his general reputation: but still that he put on a saffron robe and Sicyonian sandals, and kept on dancing a long time. But Agatharchides the Cnidian, in the eighth book of his History of Asia, relates that the friends of Alexander the son of Philippus once gave an entertainment to the king, and gilded all the sweetmeats which were to be served up in the second course. And when they wanted to eat any of them, they took off the gold and threw that away with all the rest which was not good to eat, in order that their friends might be spectators of their sumptuousness, and their servants might become masters of the gold. But they forgot that, as Duris also relates, Philippus the father of Alexander, when he had a golden cup which was fifty drachmas in weight, always took it to bed with him, and always slept with it at his head. And Seleucus says, "that some of the Thracians at their drinking parties play the game of hanging; and fix a round noose to some high place, exactly beneath which they place a stone which is easily turned round when any one stands upon it; and then they cast lots, and he who draws the lot, holding a sickle in his hand, stands upon thee stone, and puts his neck into the halter; and then another person comes and raises the stone, and the man who is suspended, when the stone moves from under him, if he is not quick enough in cutting the rope with his sickle, is killed; and the rest laugh, thinking his death good sport."

[54.] G   [162] But Archestratus of Gela, in his treatise on Gastronomy, - which is the only poetical composition which you wise men admire; following Pythagoras in this doctrine alone, namely silence, and doing this only because of your want of words; and besides that, you profess to think well of the Art of Love of Sphodrias the Cynic, and the Amatory Conversation of Protagorides, and the Convivial Dialogues of that beautiful philosopher Persaeus, compiled out of the Commentaries of Stilpon and Zenon, in which he inquires, How one may guard against guests at a banquet going to sleep; and, How one ought to use drinking of healths; and, When one ought to introduce beautiful boys and girls into a banquet; and when one ought to treat them well as if they were admired, and when one ought to send them away as disregarding them; and also, concerning various kinds of cookery, and concerning loaves, and other things; and all the over-subtle discussions in which the son of Sophroniscus has indulged concerning kissing. A philosopher who was continually exercising his intellect on such investigations as these, being entrusted, as Hermippus relates, with the citadel of Corinth by Antigonus, got drunk and lost even Corinth itself, being outwitted and defeated by Aratus the Sicyonian; who formerly had argued in his Dialogues addressed to Zenon the philosopher, contending that a wise man would in every respect be a good general; and this excellent pupil of Zenon proved this especial point admirably by his own achievements. For it was a witty saying of Bion of Borysthenes, when he saw a bronze statue of his, on which was the inscription, "Persaeus of Citium, the pupil of Zenon", that the man who engraved the inscription had made a blunder, for that it ought to have been, "Persaeus the servant (???????? not ?????? ) of Zenon"; for he had been born a slave of Zenon, as Nicias of Nicaea relates, in his History of Philosophers; and this is confirmed by Sotion the Alexandrian, in his Successions. And I have met with two books of that admirable work of Persaeus, which have this title, Convivial Dialogues.

[55.] G   But Ctesibius of Chalcis, the friend of Menedemus, as Antigonus the Carystian relates in his Lives, being asked by somebody, 'What he had ever got by philosophy?' replied, 'The power of getting a supper without contributing to it himself.' On which account Timon somewhere or other said to him - 
  Oh you mad dinner hunter, with the eyes 
  Of a dead corpse, and heart both bold and shameless.

And Ctesibius was a man who made very good guesses, and was a very witty man, and a sayer of amusing things; [163] on which account every one used to invite him to their parties; he was not a man like you, you Cynic, who never sacrificed to the Graces, nor even to the Muses. And therefore Virtue avoiding you, and all like you, sits by Pleasure, as Mnasalces of Sicyon says, in his Epigrams - 
  Here I most miserable Virtue sit 
  By Pleasure's side, and cut my hair for grief, 
  Crushed in my spirit; for profane Delight 
  Is judged by all my better, and my chief.

And Baton the comic writer says in his Homicide - 
  Now I invite those moderate philosophers, 
  Who never allow themselves a single pleasure, 
  Who keep on looking for the one wise man 
  In all their walks and conversations, 
  As if he were a slave who'd run away. 
  O wretched man, why, when you have a ticket, 
  Will you refuse to drink? Why do you now 
  Do so much wrong to the Gods? Why do you make 
  Money of greater value than the rate 
  Which nature put on it? You drink but water, 
  And so must be a worthless citizen; 
  For so you cheat the farmer and the merchant; 
  But I by getting drunk increase their trade. 
  Then you at early dawn carry round a jug, 
  Seeking for oil, so that a man must think 
  You have an hour-glass with you, not a bottle.

[56.] G   However, Archestratus, as I was saying before this long digression, whom you praise as equal to Homer because of his praises of the stomach (though your friend Timon says of the stomach, "Than which no part more shameless can be found"), when speaking of the Sea-dog, writes as follows :- 
  There are but few so happy as to know 
  This god-like food, nor do men covet it 
  Who have the silly souls of common mortals. 
  They fear because it is an animal 
  Which living preys on man. But every fish 
  Loves human flesh, if it can meet with it, 
  So it is fit that all who talk such nonsense 
  Should be confined to herbs, and should be sent 
  To Diodorus the philosopher 
  And starve, and so pythagorize with him.

But this Diodorus was by birth an Aspendian; but desiring to be thought a Pythagorean, he lived after the fashion of you Cynics, letting his hair grow, being dirty, and going barefoot. On which account some people fancied that it was an article of the Pythagorean creed to let the hair grow, which was in reality a fashion introduced by Diodorus, as Hermippus asserts. But Timaeus of Tauromenium, in the ninth book of his Histories, writes thus concerning him - "Diodorus, who was by birth an Aspendian, introduced a novel fashion of dress, and pretended to resemble the Pythagoreans. Stratonicus wrote and sent a messenger to him, desiring him who carried the message to seek out a disciple of Pythagoras who kept the portico crowded by his insane vagaries about dress, and his insolence." And Sosicrates, in the third book of the Succession of Philosophers, relates that Diodorus used to wear a long beard, and a worn-out cloak, and to keep his hair long, indulging in these fashions out of a vain ostentation. [164] For the Pythagoreans before him wore very handsome clothes, and used baths, and perfumes, and hair of the ordinary length.

  * * * * *

[63.] G   [167] But Duris, in the seventh book of his history of the Affairs of Macedonia, speaking of Pasicyprus the king of Cyprus, and of his intemperate habits, writes as follows - "Alexander, after the siege of Tyre, dismissed Pnytagoras, and gave him many presents, and among them he gave him the fortified place which he asked for. And that very place Pasicyprus the king had previously sold, in a luxurious freak, for fifty talents, to Pygmalion of Citium, selling him both the fortress itself and his own royal authority over it. And when he had received the money he grew old in Amathus." Such also was Aethiops the Corinthian, as Demetrius of Scepsis relates, of whom mention is made by Archilochus; "for he, out of his love of pleasure and intemperance, sailing with Archias to Sicily when he was about to found Syracuse, sold to his messmate for a cake of honey the lot which he had just drawn, and was about to take possession of in Syracuse."

[64.] G   #  But Demetrius carried his extravagance to such a height, he, I mean, who was the descendant of Demetrius Phalereus, according to the account of Hegesander, that he had Aristagora the Corinthian for a mistress and lived in a most expensive manner. And when the Areopagites summoned him before them, and ordered him to live more decorously - "But even now,' said he, "I live like a gentleman, for I have a most beautiful mistress, and I do no wrong to any one, and I drink Chian wine, and I have a sufficiency of everything, as my own revenues suffice for all these expenses. And I do not live as some of you do, corrupted by bribes myself, and intriguing with other men's wives."  And hereupon be enumerated some who acted in this manner by name. And Antigonus the king, having heard this made him a thesmothete. And he, being an hipparch at the Panathenaea, erected a seat close to the statues of Hermes for Aristagora, higher than the Hermae themselves. And when the mysteries were celebrated at Eleusis, he placed a seat for her close to the temple, saying that those who endeavoured to hinder him should repent it.

[65.] G   [168] But Phanodemus, and also Philochorus [ Fr_196 ], have related that in former times the judges of the Areopagus used to summon before them and to punish profligate and extravagant men, and those who had no ostensible means of living: and many others have told the same story. #  At all events, those judges sent for Menedemus and Asclepiades the philosophers when they wore young men and poor, and asked them how they managed to look so sleek and comfortable when they spent the whole day idling with philosophers, and had no property. And they replied that some one of the men about the mill had better be sent for. And when he came and said that they came every night to the mill and threshed and ground the corn, and each earned two drachmas, the judges of the Areopagus marvelled, and presented them with two hundred drachmas as a reward. And the citizens of Abdera brought Democritus to trial, on the ground that he had wasted the estate which he had inherited from his father. And when he had read to them his Great World, and his treatise concerning the Things in the Shades below, and had said that he had spent it on these works, he was discharged.

[66.] G   But those men who are not so luxurious, as Amphis says - 
  Drink throughout the day in every day, 
  Shaking their heads through their too mighty draughts.

And according to Diphilus - 
  Having three heads, like to Artemis' statue.

Being enemies to their own estate, as Satyrus in his treatise on Characters said, running through their land, tearing to pieces and plundering their own houses, selling their own property as if it were the spoil of the enemy, considering not what has been spent, but what will be spent, and not what will remain afterwards, but what will not remain, having spent beforehand in their youth the money which ought to have earned them safely through old age, rejoicing in companionship, not in companions, and in their wine, and not in those who drink it with them. But Agatharchides the Corinthian, in the twenty-eighth book of his Commentary on the Affairs of Europe, says "that Gnosippus, who was a very luxurious and extravagant man in Sparta, was forbidden by the ephors to hold intercourse with the young men." #  And among the Romans, it is related, according to the statement of Poseidonius, in the forty-ninth book of his Histories [ Fr_27 ], that there was a man named Apicius who went beyond all other men in intemperance. This is that Apicius who was the cause of banishment to Rutilius who wrote the history of the Romans in the Greek language. But concerning Apicius, the man, I mean, who is so notorious for his extravagant luxury, we have already spoken in our first book.

[67.] G   #  But Diogenes the Babylonian, in his treatise on Nobility of Birth, says "that the son of Phocion, whose name was Phocus, was such a man that there was not one Athenian who did not hate him. And whenever any one met him they said to him, 'O you man who are a disgrace to your family!' For he had expended all his patrimony on intemperance; and after this he became a flatterer of the prefect of Munychia; on which account he was again attacked and reproached by every one. And once, when a voluntary contribution was being made, he came forward and said, before the whole assembly, 'I, too, contribute my share.' And the Athenians all with one accord cried out, 'Yes, to profligacy.' And Phocus was a man very fond of drinking hard; and accordingly, when he had conquered with horses at the Panathenaea, and when his father entertained his companions at a banquet, the preparation was very splendid, and foot-tubs full of wine and spices were set before all who came in. [169] And his father, seeing this, called Phocus, and said, 'Will you not stop your companion from polluting your victory in this fashion?' "

And I know too of many other intemperate and extravagant men, whom I leave you to find out, with the exception of Callias the son of Hipponicus, whom even the tutors of little children have heard of. But concerning the others whom I have been a little hasty in mentioning, if you have anything to say, I have the doors of my ears open. So speak; for I want to know something.

[75.] G   [174] And while much such conversation as this was proceeding, on a sudden a noise was heard from some one of the neighbouring places, as from an hydraulic organ, very pleasant and agreeable, so that we all turned round towards it, being charmed by the melody; and Ulpianus looking towards the musician Alceides said, Do you hear, O you most musical of men, this beautiful harmony which has made us turn round, being enchanted by the music? And is it not the case, as it is said to be among you Alexandrians, that constant music of an unaccompanied flute causes pain rather than any musical pleasure to those who hear it? And Alceides said, - But this engine, the hydraulic organ, whether you choose to class it among stringed instruments or among wind instruments, is the invention of a fellow-countryman of ours, an Alexandrian, a barber by trade; and his name in Ctesibius. And Aristocles reports this, in his book on Choruses, saying "The question is asked, whether the hydraulic organ is a stringed instrument or a wind instrument." Now Aristoxenus did not feel sure on this point; but it is said, that Plato showed a sort of notion of the invention, making a nightly clock like the hydraulic organ; being very like an enormous hour-glass. And, indeed, the hydraulic organ does seem to be a kind of hour-glass.  It cannot, therefore, be considered a stringed instrument, and one to be played by touching. But perhaps it may be called a wind instrument, because the organ is inflated by the water; for the pipes are plunged down into the water, and when the water is agitated by a youth, as the axles penetrate through the whole organ, the pipes are inflated, and create a gentle and agreeable sound. And this organ is like a round altar; #  and they say that it was invented by Ctesibius the barber, who dwelt at that time in the territory of Aspendus, in the reign of the second Ptolemy surnamed Euergetes; and they say that he was a very eminent man; they say also, that he learnt a good deal from his wife Thais. But Tryphon, in the third book of his treatise on Names, (and it is a dissertation on Flutes and Organs) says Ctesibius the mechanic wrote a book about the water-organ; but I am not sure that he is not mistaken as to the name. At all events, Aristoxenus preferred stringed instruments which are played upon by the touch to wind instruments; saying that wind instruments are very easy; for that many people, without having been taught, can play on the flute and pipe, as for instance, shepherds.

[76.] G   And this is what I have got to say to you about the hydraulic organ, O Ulpianus. For the Phoenicians used a kind of flute called the gingras, according to the account of Xenophon, about a span in length, and of a very shrill and mournful tone. And the same instrument is used also by the Carians in their wailings, unless, indeed, when he says Phoenicia he means Caria; and indeed you may find the name used so in Corinna and in Bacchylides. And these flutes are called gingri by the Phoenicians from the lamentations for Adonis; [175] for you Phoenicians called Adonis Gingres, as Democleides tells us. And Antiphanes mentions the gingri flutes in his Physician; and Menander does so too, in his Carina; and Amphis, in his Dithyrambus, saying - 
  (A) And I have got that admirable gingras. 
  (B) What is the gingras? 
  (A) 'Tis a new invention 
  Of our countrymen, which never yet 
  Has been exhibited in any theatre, 
  But is a luxury of Athenian banquets. 
  (B) Why then not introduce it to this people? 
  (A) Because I think that I shall draw by lot 
  Some most ambitious tribe; for well I know 
  They would disturb all things with their applause.

And Axionicus says, in his Phileuripides - 
  For they are both so sick with love 
  Of the melodious strains of soft Euripides, 
  That every other music seems to them 
  Shrill as the gingras and a mere misfortune.

[77.] G   But how much better, O most sagacious Ulpianus, is this hydraulic organ, than the instrument which is called nablas; which Sopater the parodist, in his drama entitled Pylae, says is also an invention of the Phoenicians, using the following expressions - 
  Nor is the noise of the Sidonian nablas , 
  Which from the throat doth flow, at all impaired.

And in the Slave of Mystacus we find - 
  Among the instruments of harmony 
  The nablas comes, not over soft or sweet; 
  By its long sides a lifeless lotus fixed 
  Sends forth a breathed music; and excites men, 
  Singing in Bacchic strain a merry song.

And Philemon says, in his Adulterer - 
  (A) There should, O Parmenon, be here among as 
  A nablas or a female flute-player. 
  (B) What is a nablas? 
  (A) Don't you know? you idiot! 
  (B) Indeed I don't. 
  (A) What, do not know a nablas? 
  You know no good; perhaps a sambuca-player 
  You never have heard of either!

There is also an instrument called the triangle, which Juba mentions in the fourth book of his Theatrical History, and says it is an invention of the Syrians; as is also the sambuca, which is called ??????????.  But this instrument Neanthes of Cyzicus in the first book of his Seasons, says is an invention of Ibycus of Rhegium, the poet; as also the lyre called barbitos was of Anacreon. But since you are running all us Alexandrians down as unmusical, and keep mentioning the monaulos as our only national instrument, listen now to what I can tell you offhand about that.

[78.] G   For Juba, in the before-mentioned treatise, says that the Egyptians call the monaulos an invention of Osiris, just as they say that kind of plagiaulos is, which is called photinx, and that, too, I will presently show you is mentioned by a very illustrious author; for the photinx is the same as the flute, which is a national instrument. But Sophocles, in his Thamyras, speaks of the monaulos, saying - 
  For all the tuneful melodies of pipes (????????) 
  Are lost, the lyre, and monaulos too. 
  . . . . .

And Araros in his Birth of Pan, says - 
  But he, can you believe it? seized at once 
  On the monaulos, and leapt lightly forth.

[176] And Anaxandrides, in his Treasure, says - 
  I the monaulos took, and sang a wedding song.

And in his Bottle-bearer he says - 
  (A) What have you done, you Syrian, with your monaulos? 
  (B) What monaulos? 
  (A) The reed.

And Sopater, in his Bacchis, says - 
  And then he sang a song on the monaulos.

But Protagorides of Cyzicus in the second book of his treatise on the Assemblies at Daphne, says, "He touched every kind of instrument, one after another, castanets, the weak-sounding pandurus, but he drew the sweetest harmony from the sweet monaulos." #  And Poseidonius the Stoic philosopher, in the third book of his Histories, speaking of the war of the Apameans against the Larisseans, writes as follows [ Fr_2 ] - "Having taken short daggers sticking in their waists, and small lances covered with rust and dirt, and having put veils and curtains over their heads which produce a shade but do not hinder the wind from getting to their necks, dragging on asses laden with wine and every sort of meat, by the side of which were packed little photinges and little monauli, instruments of revelry, not of war." But I am not ignorant that Amerias the Macedonian, in his Dialects, says, that the monaulos is called tityrinus. So have you have, O excellent Ulpianus, a man who mentions the photinx. But that the monaulos was the same instrument which is now called calamaules, or reedfife, is clearly shown by Hedylus in his Epigrams, where he says - 
  Beneath this mound the tuneful Theon lies, 
  Whom the monaulos knew its sweetest lord; 
  Scirpalus was his son, when age had destroyed his sight, 
  And his sire him called him Scirpalus 
  Son of Eupalamus in his first birthday ode, 
  Showing that he was a choice bouquet where 
  The virtues all had met. For well he played for Glauce 
  The Muses' sports amid their wine-glad revels; 
  He sang to Battalus, an eager drinker 
  Of unmixed wine, and Cotalus and Pacalus. 
  Say then to Theon the calamaules, 
  Farewell, O Theon, tunefullest of men.

As, therefore, they now call those who play on a pipe of reeds (???????) calamaules, so also they call them now rappaules, according to the statement of Amerias the Macedonian, in his Dialects.

  * * * * *

[83.] G   [184] This then, O my word-hunting Ulpianus, is what you may learn from us Alexandrians, who are very fond of the music of the monaulos. For you do not know that Menecles, the historian of Barce, and also that Andron, in his Chronicles, him of Alexandria I mean, assert that it is the Alexandrians who instructed all the Greeks and the barbarians, when the former encyclic mode of education began to fail, on account of the incessant commotions which took place in the times of the successors of Alexander. #  There was subsequently a regeneration of all sorts of learning in the time of Ptolemy the seventh king of Egypt, the one who was properly called by the Alexandrians Cacergetes ["evil-doer"]; for he having murdered many of the Alexandrians, and banished no small number of those who had grown up to manhood with his brother, filled all the islands and cities with men learned in grammar, and philosophy, and geometry, with musicians, and painters, and schoolmasters, and physicians, and men of all kinds of trades and professions; who, being driven by poverty to teach what they knew, produced a great number of celebrated pupils.

[21.] G   [193]  #  What then, my friends, shall we call the entertainment which Antiochus, who was surnamed Epiphanes (but who was more rightly called Epimanes ["crazy"] from his actions) gave? Now he was king of the Syrians, being one of the Seleucids. And Polybius says of him [ 26.1 ], He, escaping out of the palace without the knowledge of the attendants, was often found with one or two companions wandering about the city wherever he might chance to take it into his head to go. And he was, above all other places, frequently found at the shops of the engravers of silver and of the goldsmiths, conversing on the subject of their inventions with, and inquiring into the principle of their art from, the engravers and other artists. And besides this, he often used to go among the common people, conversing with whomsoever he might chance to meet; and he would drink with the lowest and poorest strangers. And whenever he heard of any young men having a banquet, without having given any notice of his intention, he would come to join in their feast with a flute and music, behaving in a most lascivious manner; so that many used to rise up and depart, being alarmed at his strange behaviour. Often, also, be would lay aside his royal robes, and put on a common cloak, and so go round the market, like a man who was a candidate for some office: and taking some people by the hand, and embracing others, he would solicit them to vote for him, sometimes being to be made aedile, and sometimes tribune; and when he was elected, sitting in his ivory curule chair, according to the fashion which prevails among the Romans, he would hear all the causes which were pleaded in the forum, and decide them with great attention and earnestness, by which conduct he greatly perplexed sensible men. For some thought him a man of very simple tastes, and others considered him mad. And his conduct with respect to presents was very much the same. [194] For he would give some people dice of antelope's bones, and some he would present with dates, and to others he would give gold. And even if he met people in the street whom he had never seen, he would give them presents unexpectedly. And in his sacrifices, which were offered up in the different cities, and in the honours offered to the gods, he surpassed all the kings who had ever existed. And any one may conjecture this from the temple raised to Olympian Zeus at Athens, and from the statues around the altar at Delos. And he used to bathe in the public baths, often when they were completely full of the citizens, and then he would have earthen pans of the most expensive perfumes brought to him. And on one of these occasions, when someone one said to him, "Happy are you kings, who use all these things and smell so sweet," he made the man no answer at the time; but coming the next day to the place where he was bathing, he caused him to have a pan of the largest size of that most precious ointment called ?????? poured over his head, so that when that had been done, every one near got up and hastened to get a little of the ointment, and as they fell down in their haste, by reason of the slipperiness of the floor, every one laughed, as did the king himself.

[22.] G   "And this same king," continues Polybius [ 30.25 ], "having heard of the games which had been celebrated in Macedonia by Aemilius Paullus the Roman general, wishing to surpass Paullus in his magnificence and liberality, sent ambassadors and delegates [theoroi] to the different cities to proclaim that games were going to be exhibited by him at Daphne, so that the Greeks all hastened with great eagerness to come to him to see them. And the beginning of the exhibition was a splendid procession, arranged in this way:-- Some men led the way armed in the Roman fashion, in breastplates of chain armour, all men in the flower of their youth, to the number of five thousand; immediately after them, five thousand Mysians followed; and then three thousand Cilicians, armed in the fashion of light-armed skirmishers, having golden crowns; and after them three thousand Thracians and five thousand Galatians; these were followed by twenty thousand Macedonians, and by five thousand men armed with brazen shields, and as many more with silver shields; they were followed by two hundred and forty pairs of gladiators to fight in single combat; behind these came a thousand Nisaean cavalry, and three thousand men of the city guard, the greatest part of whom had golden trappings and golden crowns, but some had silver trappings; to these succeeded the cavalry who are called the King's Companions; these amounted to one thousand men, all equipped with golden trappings; next to these was the battalion of the King's Friends, of the same number and the same equipment; after these a thousand picked man; and they were followed by what was called the Agema, which was considered to be the most excellent squadron of all the cavalry, to the number of a thousand men; last of all came the cataphracts, having their name from the fact that both men and horses were completely enveloped in armour; they were in number fifteen hundred men. And all the above-mentioned soldiers had purple cloaks, and many had them also embroidered with gold or painted with figures of living animals. Besides all this, there were a hundred chariots with six horses, and forty with four homes; then a chariot drawn by four elephants, and another by two; [195] and last of all, six-and-thirty elephants, all handsomely appointed, followed one by one.

[23.] G   "The rest of the procession was such as it is difficult adequately to describe, and it must be enumerated in a summary manner. For youths walked in the procession to the number of eight hundred, all having golden crowns; and fat oxen to the number of one thousand; and deputations to see to the performance of separate sacrifices, very little short of three hundred; and there were eight hundred elephants' tusks carried by, and such a multitude of statues as it is beyond any one's power to enumerate. For images were carried in the procession of all who are ever said or thought by men to be gods, or deities, or demigods, or heroes; some gilt all over, and some arrayed in golden-broidered robes. And to all of them suitable inscriptions according to the accounts commonly received of them were attached, carved in the most expensive materials. And they were followed by an image of Night and another of Day; and of the Earth, and of Heaven, and of Morning, and of Noon. And the vast quantity of gold plate and silver plate was such as perhaps a man may form a guess at from the following account. For a thousand slaves belonging to Dionysius the secretary and amanuensis of the king joined in the procession, each carrying articles of silver plate, of which there was not one weighing less than a thousand drachmas. And there were six hundred slaves belonging to the king himself carrying articles of gold plate. And besides them there were women to the number of two hundred sprinkling every one with perfumes out of golden water-pots. And they were succeeded by eighty women magnificently apparelled, borne on litters with golden feet, and five hundred borne on litters with silver feet. And this was the most important portion of the procession.

[24.] G   "But after the games were over and the single combats and the hunting, during the whole thirty days which he exhibited these shows, on the first five days every one who came into the gymnasium was anointed with a saffron perfume shed upon him out o1 golden dishes. And there were fifteen of those golden dishes full of equal quantities of cinnamon and spikenard. And in a similar manner in the five next days there was brought in essence of fenugreek, and of marjoram, and of lilies, all differing in their scent; and some days there were laid a thousand triclinia for the banquet; and some days fifteen hundred all laid in the most expensive possible manner. And the arrangement of the whole business was superintended by the king himself. For having a very fine horse he went up and down the whole procession, commanding some to advance, and others to halt.  And stopping at the entrances of the rooms where the drinking was going on he brought some in, and to others he assigned places on the couches. And he himself conducted in the attendants who brought in the second course. And he went round the whole banquet, sometimes sitting down in one place, and presently lying down in another place. And sometimes even while he was eating he would lay down what he was eating or his cup, and jump up and go away to another part of the room. And he would go all round the company, at times, pledging some of the guests in a standing posture; and at times entertaining himself with the jesters or with the music. And when the entertainment had lasted a long time and many of the guests had gone away, then the king would be brought in by buffoons all covered up, and laid on the ground as if he had been one of their band. And when the music excited him, he would jump up and dance, and act with the mummers, so that every one felt ashamed for him and fled away. And all this was done partly with the treasure which he brought out of Egypt, having plundered Ptolemy Philometor the king there, in defiance of his treaty with him when he was but a little boy; and some of the money too was contributed by his friends. And he had also sacrilegiously plundered most of the temples in his dominions."

[25.] G   And while all the guests marvelled at the conduct of the king, seeing that he was not illustrious but absolutely mad, [196] #  Masurius brought forward Callixeinus the Rhodian, who in the fourth book of his History of Alexandria has given an account of a spectacle and procession which was exhibited by that most admirable of all monarchs, Ptolemy Philadelphus. And he says:-- "But before I begin, I will give a description of the tent which was prepared within the circuit of the citadel, apart from the place provided for the reception of the soldiers, and artisans, and foreigners. For it was wonderfully beautiful, and worth hearing about.  Its size was such as to be able to hold a hundred and thirty couches placed in a circle, and it was furnished in the following manner:-- There were wooden pillars at intervals, five on each side of the tent longwise, fifty cubits high, and something less than one cubit broad. And on these pillars at the top was a capital, of square figure, carefully fitted, supporting the whole weight of the roof of the banqueting room. And over this was spread in the middle a scarlet veil with a white fringe, like a canopy; and on each side it had beams covered over with turreted veils, with white centres, on which canopies embroidered all over the centre were placed. And of the pillars four were made to resemble palm-trees, and they had in the centre a representation of thyrsi. And on the outside of these a portico ran, adorned with a peristyle on three sides, with a vaulted roof. And in this place it was intended that the company of the feasters should sit down. And the interior of it was surrounded with scarlet curtains. But in the middle of the space there were strange hides of beasts, strange both as to their variegated colour and their size, suspended. And the part which surrounded this portico in the open air was shaded by myrtle-trees and laurels, and other suitable shrubs. And the whole floor was strewed with flowers of every description. For Egypt, on account of the temperate character of the atmosphere which surrounds it, and on account of the fondness of the inhabitants for gardening, produces in great abundance, and all the year round, those things which in other countries are rarely found and only at particular seasons. And roses, and white lilies, and numberless other flowers are never wanting in that country. On which account, though this entertainment took place in the middle of winter, still there was a show of flowers which was quite incredible to the foreigners. For flowers of which one could not easily have found enough to make one chaplet in any other city were supplied in the greatest abundance here, to make chaplets for every one of the nests at this entertainment, and were strewed thickly over the whole floor of the tent; so as really to give the appearance of a most divine meadow.

[26.] G   "And by the posts round the entire teat there were placed animals carved in marble by the foremost artists, a hundred in number. And in the spaces between the posts there were pictures hung by the Sicyonian painters; and alternately with these there were carefully selected images of every kind; and garments embroidered with gold, and most exquisite cloaks, some of them having portraits of the kings of Egypt embroidered on them; and some, stories taken from the mythology. Above them were placed gold and silver shields alternately; and on the spaces above those shields, which wore eight cubits high, caves were made, six on each side of the tent longwise, and four at each end. There were likewise in them representations of eating parties opposite to one another, of tragic, and comic, and satyric animals, having on real clothes. [197] And before them were placed golden goblets. And in the middle of the caves were placed nymphaea, and on them there lay golden Delphian tripods, having pedestals of their own. And along the highest part of the roof were golden eagles all facing one another, each fifteen cubits large. There were also golden couches, with feet made like sphinxes, on the two sides of the tent, a hundred on each side. For the front of the tent was left open.  And under these there were strewed purple carpets of the finest wool, with the carpet pattern on both sides. And there were handsomely embroidered rugs very beautifully elaborated on them. Besides this, thin Persian cloths covered all the centre space where the guests walked, having most accurate representations of animals embroidered on them. And by them were placed tripods for the guests, made of gold, two hundred in number, so that there were two for every couch, and they rested on silver pedestals. And behind, out at sight, then, were a hundred flat dishes of silver, and an equal number of layers. On the opposite side of the sitting-room there was fixed another sideboard, opposite to that on which the cups and goblets were placed; and on that wore all the rest of the things which had been prepared for, or could come into use. And they were all made of gold, and studded with precious stones; admirably carved and wrought. And it has appeared to me too long a task to undertake to enumerate every article of the furniture, and even all the different kinds separately. But the entire weight of all the plate and valuables there exhibited came to ten thousand talents.

[27.] G   "But now that we have gone over everything that was to be seen in the tent, we will proceed to the shows and processions exhibited. For it passed through the stadium which there is in the city. And first of all went the procession of the Morning Star. For it began at the time when that star first appears. After that came the procession which bore the name of the parents of the kings. And next came the processions sacred to all the gods respectively, each having an arrangement appropriate to the history of each separate deity. Last of all came the procession of Hesperus, as the hour of that one starting coincided with that time. But if any one wishes to know the separate particulars, he may take the description of the quinquennial games and consider them. But in the Dionysiac procession first of all there went the Sileni who keep off the multitude, some clad in purple cloaks, and some in scarlet ones. And these were followed by Satyrs, twenty in each division of the stadium, bearing gilded lamps made of ivy-wood. And after them came images of Victory, having golden wings, and they bore in their hands incense-burners six cubits in height, adorned with branches made of ivy-wood and gold, clad in tunics embroidered with figures of animals, and they themselves also had a great deal of golden ornament about them. And after them there followed an altar of six cubits in height, a double altar, covered all over with ivy-leaves gilded, having a crown of vine-leaves on it all gold, enveloped in bandages with white centres. And that was followed by boys in purple tunics, bearing frankincense, and myrrh, and saffron, on golden dishes. And after them came forty Satyrs,, crowned with ivy garlands made of gold. And they were painted as to their bodies, some with purple, some with vermilion, and some with other colours. And these also wore each a golden crown made to imitate vine-leaves and ivy-leaves. [198] And after them came two Sileni in purple cloaks and white fringes to them. And one of them had a petasus and a golden caduceus, and the other had a trumpet. And between them went a man of gigantic size, four cubits high, in a tragical dress and ornaments, bearing the golden horn of Amaltheia. And his name was The Year. And he was followed by a woman of great beauty and of more than ordinary size, adorned with quantities of gold and a superb dress; bearing in one of her hands a garland of peach blossoms, and in her other hand a branch of the palm-tree. And she was called Penteteris. And she was succeeded by the Four Seasons dressed in character, and each of them bearing its appropriate fruits. Next to them came two incense-burners made of ivy-wood, covered with gold, and six cubits in height, and a large square golden altar in the middle of them. And then again Satyrs, having garlands of ivy-leaves made of gold, and clad in purple robes. And some of them bore golden wine-jars, and others bore goblets. After them marched Philiscus the poet, being a priest of Dionysus, and with him all the artisans who were concerned in the service of Dionysus. And next to them were carried the Delphian tripods as prizes for the trainers of the athletes; the one for the trainer of the boys nine cubits in height, and the other, twelve cubits in height, for the trainer of the men.

[28.] G   "After them was a four-wheeled wagon fourteen cubits long, and eight cubits wide; and it was drawn by a hundred and eighty men; and in it was placed an image of Dionysus ten cubits high, pouring libations of wine out of a golden goblet, having on a purple tunic reaching down to the feet; and he was clad in a purple garment embroidered with gold; and in front of him there lay a golden Lacedaemonian goblet, holding fifteen measures of wine, and a golden tripod, in which was a golden incense-burner, and two golden bowls, full of cassia and saffron; and a shade covered it round adorned with ivy-leaves and vine-leaves, and all sorts of other green leaves; and to it were fastened chaplets, and fillets, and thyrsi, and drums, and turbans, and satyric and comic and tragic masks. And the wagon was followed by priests and priestesses, and newly initiated votaries, and by companies of every nation, and by people bearing the mystic fan. And after this came the Macedonian bacchants, called Mimallones, and Bassarae, and Lydian women, with dishevelled hair, and wearing garlands, some of snakes, and others of branches of yew and of vine-leaves and ivy-leaves, and some held daggers in their hands, and others held snakes. And after them another four-wheeled wagon was drawn, of the width of eight cubits, and it was drawn by sixty men; and in it was a statue of Nysa, of eight cubits high, in a sitting posture, clothed in a box-coloured tunic embroidered with gold, and it was also clad in a Laconian cloak; and this statue rose up by mechanism, without any one applying his hand to it; and it poured libations of milk out of a golden bottle, and then it sat down again; and in its left band it bore a thyrsus wrapped round with turbans, and it was crowned with a garland of ivy-leaves, made of gold, and with gorgeous bunches of grapes inlaid with precious stones; and it had a parasol over it; and on the corners of the wagon were fastened four golden lamps.

[199] "And next to that another four-wheeled wagon was drawn along, twenty cubits in length and sixteen in width, mad it was drawn by three hundred men. And on it there was a wine-press twenty-four cubits in length and fifteen in breadth, full of grapes; and sixty Satyrs were trampling on the grapes, singing a song in praise of the wine-press, to the music of a flute. And Silenus presided over them; and the new wine ran out over the whole road. Next to that was drawn along a wagon, twenty-five cubits long and fourteen broad; and that was drawn by six hundred men. And on this wagon was a sack holding three thousand measures of wine, consisting of leopards' skins, sewn together. And this too allowing its liquor to escape, gradually flowed over the whole road. And it was followed by Satyrs and Sileni, to the number of a hundred and twenty, all wearing garlands, and carrying some casks of wine, and some bowls, and some large Thericlean goblets, all made of gold.

[29.] G   And next to that was carried a silver vessel containing six hundred measures of wine, being drawn on a four-wheeled wagon by six hundred men. And under its lips, and under its ears, and under its bottom, it had figures of animals engraved; and in the middle it was crowned with a golden crown, inlaid with precious stones. Next to that there were carried two silver goblets, twelve cubits in circumference and six cubits in height; and these had figures standing out in relief above, and also on their round parts all round. And on their feet they had chased figures of animals two cubits and a half long and a cubit high, in great numbers: and ten large bathing-vessels, and sixteen ewers, of which the larger ones contained thirty measures, and the smaller ones five; then twenty-four cauldrons with acorn bosses, on five side-boards; and two silver wine-presses, on which were twenty-four urns; and a table of solid silver twelve cubits round; and thirty other tables six cubits each in circumference: and in addition to this, four tripods, one of which was sixteen cubits in circumference, and was made entirely of silver; but the other three, which were less, were studded with precious stones in the middle. And after these there were carried some Delphic tripods, made of silver, eighty in number, smaller than those previously described, being also of a square, or four-cornered shape. And six-and-twenty water-cans, and sixteen Panathenaic jars, and a hundred and sixty wine-coolers, the largest of which contained six measures and the smallest contained two; and all these were made of silver.

[30.] G   "And next to them, those men followed in the procession who carried the articles of gold-plate,-- four Lacedaemonian goblets, having crowns on them made to represent vine-leaves, each containing four measures; and two of Corinthian workmanship placed on sideboards, and these had figures of animals in richly chased work of great beauty, in a sitting posture, and on their necks and on their bellies were other reliefs curiously wrought, and each of them contained eight measures. And there was a wine-press in which there were ten urns, and two jars, each holding five measures, and two flagons, each holding two measures, and twenty-two wine-coolers, the largest of which contained thirty measures, and the smallest one measure. There were also exhibited four large golden tripods, and a large sideboard for gold plate, that being also made of gold itself and studded with precious stones, ten cubits in height, having six rows of shelves in it, on which were figures of animals of the size of four palms, most exquisitely wrought, in very great numbers; and two goblets, and two crystal goblets mounted in gold; and four more sideboards, two of them four cubits high; [200] and three others which were smaller, and ten water-cans, and an altar three cubits high, and twenty-five dishes for holding barley loaves.

"After this had been carried by, there walked sixteen hundred boys clad in white tunics, and crowned some with ivy, and some with pine, of whom two hundred and fifty carried golden pitchers and four hundred carried silver ones; and of the rest three hundred and twenty carried golden wine-coolers, and some carried silver ones. And after them other boys carried jars, for the purpose of drinking sweet wine out of, twenty of which were gold, and fifty silver, and three hundred were painted with every kind of colour and hue; and all the spectators who were present in the stadium took a moderate draught of the sweet wine, which was mixed in these ewers and casks."

[31.] G   After these things he enumerates tables four cubits high, on which were many things worth looking at, which were all carried round for the spectators to see, being beautifully wrought. "And among them was a representation of the bed-chamber of Semele, in which were seen statues clad in golden tunics, inlaid with precious stones of the greatest value. And it would not be right to pass over this four-wheeled wagon, of the length of twenty-two cubits and of the breadth of fourteen, drawn by five hundred men. And on it was a cave exceedingly deep, overgrown with ivy and yew, and out of it flew doves, and pigeons, and turtle-doves all along the road as the wagon proceeded, having their feet tied with slight threads, so as to be easily caught by the spectators. And out of the cave there also rose two fountains, one of milk and one of wine, and around it all the nymphs had garlands of gold, and Hermes had a golden herald's wand, and very superb raiment. And on another four-wheeled wagon, on which the return of Dionysus from the Indians was represented, there was a figure of Dionysus twelve cubits high, riding upon an elephant, clad in a purple robe, and having on a crown of vine-leaves and ivy-leaves of gold, and bearing in his hands a spear like a thyrsus, made also of gold; and he wore sandals embroidered with golden figures. And there sat before him, on the neck of the elephant, a Satyr five cubits in height, crowned with a chaplet of golden pine-leaves, and holding in his right hand a goat's horn made of gold, with which he appeared to be blowing signals. And the elephant had golden trappings; and on his neck he had a crown of ivy-leaves made of gold; and he was followed by five hundred maidens dressed in purple tunics, with golden girdles; and those who went first, to the number of a hundred and twenty, wore crowns of pine-leaves made of gold; and they were succeeded by a hundred and twenty Satyrs clad in complete armour, some of silver and some of brass. And after them there marched five troops of asses, on which rode Sileni and Satyrs, all wearing crowns. And of the asses some had gold and some silver frontlets and harnesses.

[32.] G    And after them came twenty-four chariots drawn by four elephants each, and sixty chariots each drawn by a pair of goats, and twelve chariots by antelopes, and seven by oryxes, and fifteen by buffaloes, eight by pairs of ostriches, and seven by gnus, and four by pairs of zebras, and four chariots also drawn each by four zebras. And on all these animals rode boys wearing the garments of charioteers, and the broad hats called petasi; and besides them were little girls, armed with small shields, and thyrsi-spears, and they also were dressed in golden-broidered garments; and the boys who were acting as charioteers were crowned with pine-leaf chaplets, and the girls with ivy-leaves. And besides this there were three pairs of camels, on either side three, and they were followed by carts drawn by mules; and these had on them barbaric palanquins, [201] on which sat women from India and other countries, dressed as prisoners. And of the camels, some bore three hundred minae weight of frankincense, and three hundred of myrrh, and two hundred of saffron, and cassia, and cinnamon, and iris, and two hundred of other spices. And next to them came some Ethiopians bearing presents, same of whom carried six hundred elephant's tusks, and others carried two thousand fagots of ebony, and others carried sixty gold and silver goblets, and a quantity of gold-dust.  And after them came two huntsmen, having hunting-spears with golden points; and twenty-four hundred dogs were led in the procession, some Indian dogs, and others Hyrcanian and Molossian hounds, and hounds of other breeds too.

"After them came a hundred and fifty men carrying trees from which were suspended birds and beasts of every imaginable country and description; and then were carried a lot of cages, in which were parrots, and peacocks, and guinea-fowls, and pheasants, and other Ethiopian birds in great numbers."

And when he had mentioned many other things, and enumerated herds of animals, he continued, "A hundred and thirty Ethiopian sheep, three hundred Arabian sheep, twenty Euboean sheep, some white hornless cattle, six-and-twenty Indian cows, eight Ethiopian oxen, one immense white bear, fourteen leopards, sixteen panthers, four lynxes, three bear-cubs, one cameleopard, and one rhinoceros from Ethiopia.

[33.] G   "And after these beasts came an image of Dionysus flying to the altar of Rhea when he was pursued by Hera, having on a golden crown, Priapus standing by him crowned with a crown of ivy-leaves of gold, and the statue of Hera had also a golden crown on its head. And there were images of Alexander and of Ptolemy, crowned with chaplets of ivy leaves made of gold. And the statue of Virtue, which stood by the side of that of Ptolemy, had a golden crown of olive-leaves. And Priapus was with them, having a crown of ivy-leaves made of gold. And the city of Corinth had a large image there, standing by the side of Ptolemy, and that also wore a golden diadem; and by all these lay a large golden stand full of articles of gold plate, and a golden goblet containing five measures. And this wagon was followed by women having very sumptuous dresses and ornaments, and they bore the names of cities, some of cities of Ionia, and other Greek towns, as many as, occupying the islands, and the coast of Asia, were made subject to the Persians; and they all wore golden crowns. And on other chariots there was borne a golden thyrsus ninety cubits long, and a silver spear sixty cubits long; and on another a golden phallus, a hundred and twenty cubits long, chased all over, and wreathed with golden garlands, having on the end a golden star, the circumference of which was six cubits.

"Now in all the numerous things which we have enumerated as forming part of this procession, we have selected these only in which gold and silver were contained. But there were numerous other articles and parts of the exhibition well worth seeing, and vast numbers of beasts and of horses, and twenty-four enormous lions. There wore also other four-wheeled wagons in great numbers, bearing not only statues of kings, but also full of images of the gods. And after them proceeded a band of six hundred men, among whom were three hundred harp-players playing on their instruments, having harps made entirely of gold, and golden crowns on their heads; [202] and after them came two thousand bulls all of the same colour, with gilded horns, and having frontlets of gold, and crowns in the middle of their foreheads, and necklaces and breastplates on their necks and chests, and these were all made of gold.

[34.] G   "And after this came a procession in honour of Zeus and of many other gods; and after all these, came a procession in honour of Alexander, who had a golden statue, borne on a chariot drawn by real elephants, having Victory and Athene on each side of him. And numbers of thrones were borne in the procession, made of ivory and gold, on one of which lay a crown of gold; on another a pair of horns made of gold; on another was a golden chaplet; and on another a single horn made of solid gold. And on the throne of Ptolemy Soter lay a crown which had been made of ten thousand pieces of gold money. And there were also carried in the procession three hundred and fifty golden incense burners, and golden altars, all crowned with golden crowns, on one of which were firmly placed four golden lamps ten cubits high. There were also carried twelve stoves with golden tops, one of which was twelve cubits in circumference and forty cubits in height; and another was fifteen cubits high. There were also carried nine Delphic tripods made of gold, each four cubits high, and eight others six cubits high; another thirty cubits high, on which were figures of animals carved in gold, four cubits high, and a crown of vine-loaves of gold going all round. There were also carried in the procession seven palm-trees overlaid with gold, eight cubits high, and a golden herald's staff forty-five cubits long, and a thunderbolt overlaid with gold forty cubits in size, and a gilt thrice, the circumference of which was forty cubits; and besides all this, a pair of horns eight cubits long. And an immense number of gilded figures of animals was also exhibited, the greater part of which were twelve cubits high; and beasts of enormous size, and eagles twenty cubits high. And golden crowns were also exhibited to the number of three thousand and two hundred. And there was a separate mystic crown made of gold studded with valuable stones, eighty cubits high. This was the crown which was placed at the door of the temple of Berenice; and there was also an aegis of gold. There were also exhibited a vast number of golden chaplets, which were borne by young maidens sumptuously attired, one of which was two cubits high and sixteen cubits in circumference.

"There was also exhibited a golden breastplate twelve cubits broad, and another breastplate of silver eighteen cubits broad, having on it two golden thunderbolts of the size of ten cubits each, and a garland of oak-leaves studded with precious stones; and twenty golden shields, and sixty-four suits of complete armour also of gold, and two golden greaves three cubits in height, and twelve golden dishes and a most countless number of flagons, and thirty-six vessels for wine and ten large anointing vessels, and twelve ewers, and fifty large dishes for barley loaves, and tables of different sorts, and five repositories for gold plates, and a horn thirty cubits long made of solid gold. And all these articles of gold plate were exclusive of those carried in the procession of Dionysus. Then there were four hundred wagons of silver plate, and twenty wagons of gold plate, and eight hundred of perfumes and spices.

[35.] G   "And after all these things came a procession of troops, both cavalry and infantry, all armed and appointed in a most superb manner: [203] infantry to the number of fifty-seven thousand six hundred; and cavalry to the number of twenty-three thousand two hundred. And all these marched in the procession, all clad in suitable apparel, and all having their appropriate armour; and there were also great numbers of suits of armour besides lying for inspection, too numerous for any one to count, (but Callixeinus has made a catalogue of them;) and they were also crowned in the assembly with twenty golden crowns. And first of all Ptolemy and Berenice were crowned with twenty-three, standing on golden chariots, in the sacred precincts of Dodona. And the expense of money which was incurred on this occasion, amounted to two thousand two hundred and thirty-nine talents, and fifty minae; and this was all counted by the clerks of the treasury, owing to the eagerness of those who had given the crowns, before the spectacle came to an end. But Ptolemy Philadelphus, their son, was crowned with twenty golden crowns, two of them on golden chariots, and one six cubits high on a pillar, and five five cubits high, and six four cubits high."

[36.] G   Now my friends and fellow-banqueters, what kingdom ever possessed such quantities of gold as this? For Egypt did not acquire all this by taking money from the Persians and from Babylon, or by working mines, or by having a river Pactolus, bearing down gold-dust in its waters. For its only river is that which can really be called the Golden Stream -- the Nile, which together with its boundless supplies of food does bring down gold without alloy, which is dug up out of the soil without danger, in quantities sufficient for all men, diffused over the whole soil like the gifts of Triptolemus. On which account the Byzantine poet, who had the name of Parmenon given to him, says - 
  O god of Egypt, mighty Nile.

But king Philadelphus surpassed most kings in riches; and he pursued every kind of manufacturing and trading art so zealously, that he also surpassed every one in the number of his ships. Now the largest ships which he had were these:-- two of thirty banks of oars, one of twenty, four of thirteen, two of twelve, fourteen of eleven, thirty of nine, thirty-seven of seven, five of six, seventeen of five. And from quadriremes down to light half-decked triremes, for purposes of war, be had twice as many as all these put together. And the vessels which were sent to the different islands and to the other cities under his dominion, and to Libya, amounted to more than four thousand.  And concerning the number of his books, and the way in which he furnished his libraries, and the way in which he collected treasures for his Museium, why need speak? for every one remembers all these things.

[37.] G   [203]  #  But since we have mentioned the subject of the building of ships, let us speak (for it is worth hearing of) of the ships which were built also by Ptolemy Philopator, which are mentioned by the same Callixeinus in the first book of his Account of Alexandria, where he speaks as follows:- "Philopator built a ship with forty ranks of rowers, being two hundred and eighty cubits long and thirty-eight cubits from one side to the other; and in height up to the gunwale it was forty-eight cubits; and from the highest part of the stern to the water-line was fifty-three cubits; and it had four rudders, each thirty cubits long; [204] and oars for the thranitae, the largest thirty-eight cubits in length, which, from having lead in their handles, and because they were very heavy in the part inside the ship, being accurately balanced, were, in spite of their bulk, very handy to use. And the ship had two heads and two sterns, and seven beaks, one of which was longer than all the rest, and the others were of smaller size; and some of them were fixed to the ears of the ship; and it had twelve undergirths to support the keel, and each was six hundred cubits in length. And it was well proportioned to a most extraordinary degree; and all the appointments of the vessel were admirable, for it had figures of animals on it not less than twelve cubits in size, both at the head and at the stern, and every part of it was inlaid and ornamented with figures in wax; and the space between the oars down to the very keel had a running pattern of ivy-leaves and thyrsi; and there was great store of every kind of equipment to supply all parts of the ship that might require any. And when it put to sea it held more than four thousand rowers, and four hundred supernumeraries; and on the deck were three thousand marines, or at least two thousand eight hundred and fifty. And besides all these there was another large body of men under the decks, and a vast quantity of provisions and supplies. And the vessel was launched originally from a sort of framework, which they say was erected and made out of the wood of fifty ships of five ranks of oars; and it was launched by the multitude with great acclamations and blowing of trumpets. But after that a Phoenician devised a new method of launching it, having dug a trench under it, equal to the ship itself in length, which he dug close to the harbour. And in the trench he built props of solid stone five cubits deep, and across them he laid beams crosswise, running the whole width of the trench, at four cubits distance from one another; and then making a channel from the sea he filled all the space which he had excavated with water, out of which he easily brought the ship by the aid of whatever men happened to be at hand; then closing the entrance which had been originally made, he drained the water off again by means of engines; and when this had been done the vessel rested securely on the before-mentioned cross-beams.

[38.] G   "Philopator also built a vessel for the river which he called Thalamegus, or the Carrier of his Bed-chamber, in length half a stade, and in width at the broadest part thirty cubits; and the height together with the frame for the awning was little short of forty cubits. And its appearance was not exactly like ships of war, nor merchant vessels either, but it was something different from both, on account of the necessity imposed by the depth of the river. For below it was flat and broad; but in its main hull it was high. And the parts at the extremity, and especially at the head, extended a sufficient length, so as to exhibit a very pretty and elegant sweep. The ship also had two heads and two sterns. And it rose to a considerable height above the water, as was necessary, because the waves in the river often rise very high. And in the middle of its hull were constructed banqueting-rooms and sleeping-rooms, and everything else which may be convenient for living in. And round the ship were double corridors running about three sides, each of which was not less than five plethra in circumference. [205] And the arrangement of the lower one was like a peristyle, and that in the upper part was covered in, and surrounded with walls and windows on all sides. And when you first came into the vessel by the stern your eye was met by a colonnade, open in front, and surrounded by pillars. And opposite to it in the bow of the vessel there was a sort of propylaeum constructed, made of ivory and most expensive woods. And after you had passed through that, then you came to something like a proscenium, covered in overhead. And again in the same way in the middle of the vessel was another colonnade, open behind, and an entrance of four folding-doors led to it. And both on the right hand and on the left there were windows, admitting a pleasant breeze.

"To these was joined a room of very large size, and that was adorned with pillars all round, and it was capable of containing twenty couches. And the greater pert of it was made of split cedar, and of Milesian cypress. And the doors which were round it, being twenty in number, were put together with beams of fragrant cedar, having ivory ornaments. And all the nails and fastenings which were visible were made of red brass, which had taken a polish like that of gold from the fire. And of the pillars the bodies were of cypress-wood; but the capitals were of Corinthian workmanship, adorned with ivory and gold. The whole of the capitals of the pillars were of gold; and there was a sort of girdle on them having figures of animals beautifully carved in ivory, more than a cubit high, of which the workmanship was not so conspicuous as the exquisite beauty of the materials. There was a beautiful roof to the banqueting-room, square, and made of cypress wood. And its ornaments were all carved, having a golden face. Next to this banqueting-chamber was a sleeping-chamber holding seven couches; and to that there was joined a narrow passage, which separated the woman's chamber from this one by the width of the hold. And by the passage was a banqueting-room holding nine couches very like the large one in the sumptuousness of its furniture; and a bed-chamber holding five couches. As to the rooms then on the first deck this was the general appearance presented.

[39.] G   "But when you had ascended by the stairs which were close to the before-mentioned sleeping chamber, there was another chamber capable of containing five couches, having a vaulted oblong roof. And near to it was a temple of Aphrodite, in form like a rotunda, in which was a marble statue of the goddess. And opposite to this was another banqueting-room, very sumptuous, adorned all round with columns: for the columns were all made of Indian stone. And near to this banqueting-room were more sleeping-chambers with furniture and appointments corresponding to what has been already mentioned. And as you went on towards the head of the vessel was another apartment dedicated to Dionysus, capable of holding thirteen couches, surrounded with pillars, having its cornices all gilt as far down as the epistyle which ran round the room, but the roof corresponded to the character of the god. And in it there was on the right hand a large cave constructed, the colour of which was stone, for in fact it was made of real stone and gold; and in it images were placed of all the relations of the king, made of Parian marble. And there was another banqueting-room, very pleasant, above the roof of the greatest apartment, having an arrangement like that of a tent, [206] so that some of it had no actual roof, but there were arched and vaulted beams running along the top at intervals, along which purple curtains were stretched whenever the vessel was in motion. And after this there was an open chamber occupying the same room above that was occupied by the portico before mentioned as being below. And a winding ladder joined on to it, leading to the secret walk, and a banqueting-room capable of containing nine couches, constructed and furnished in the Egyptian style. For round pillars were run up in it with alternate drums of white and black, all placed in parallel lines. And their heads were of round shape; and the whole of the figures round them were engraved like roses a little expanded. And round that part which is called the basket there were not tendrils and rough leaves as is the case in Greek pillars, but calyxes of the river-lotus, and the fruit of newly budding dates. And sometimes many other kinds of flowers were also represented. And under the roof of the capital which lies upon the drum, where it joins on to the head, there were ornaments like the flower leaves of the Egyptian bean intertwined together.  This then is the way in which the Egyptians construct and ornament their pillars, and this is the way in which they variegate their walls with black and white bricks: and sometimes also they employ the stone which is called alabaster. And there were many other ornaments all over the main hull of the vessel, and over the centre, and many other chambers and divisions in every part of it.

"And the mast of this vessel was seventy cubits in height, and it had a linen sail, adorned with a purple fringe. #  And the whole of the wealth which had been so carefully preserved by king Philadelphus was dissipated by the last Ptolemy, who also excited the war against Gabinius, who was not a man, but a mere flute-player and conjuror."

[40.] G   #  But concerning the ship built by Hieron, the tyrant of Syracuse, which also Archimedes the geometrician superintended, I do not think it right to be silent, since a certain man named Moschion has given a description of it, which I read over with great care very lately. Moschion, then, writes as follows:-

"Diocles, a citizen of Abdera, speaks with great admiration of the engine called Helepolis, which was brought by Demetrius against the city of the Rhodians, and applied to their walls. And Timaeus extols highly the funeral pile made for Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily. And Hieronymus lavishes his admiration on the building and adorning of the carriage in which the body of Alexander was borne to the tomb. And Polycleitus speaks in high terms of the candlestick which was made for the king of Persia. But Hieron, the king of the Syracusans, who was in every respect a friend to the Romans, was very attentive to the furnishing of temples and gymnasia; and was also very earnest in ship-building, having built a great number of vessels to carry corn; the construction of one of which I will describe. For the wood, he caused such a number of trees to be cut down on Mount Aetna as would have been sufficient for sixty triremes, and when this was done he prepared nails, and planks for the sides and for the inside, and wood for every other purpose that could be required, some from Italy and some from Sicily. And for ropes he provided cordage from Spain, and hemp, and pitch from the river Rhine; and he collected great quantities of useful things from all quarters. And he collected also shipwrights and other artisans. And having appointed Archias the Corinthian the superintendent of them all, and the principal architect, [207] he bade them labour at the construction with zeal and earnestness, he himself also devoting his days to watching its progress. And in this way he finished half the ship in six months; and every part of the vessel as soon as it was finished was immediately covered over with plates of teal. And there were three hundred workmen employed in working up the timber, besides the subordinates whom they had to assist them. And it was arranged to draw this portion that was done so far down to the sea, that it might receive the last finishing strokes there. And when there was a great inquiry as to the best method of launching it into the sea, Archimedes the mechanician launched it by himself with the aid of a few persons. For having prepared a windlass [ helix ] he drew this vessel, enormous as it was, down into the sea. And Archimedes was the first person who ever invented this windlass. But after the remainder of the ship had also been completed in six months more, and it had been surrounded all round with brazen nails, the greater part of which weighed ten minae, and the rest were half as big again - (and they were driven in through holes made beforehand by gimlets, so as to hold the planks firm; and they were fastened to the wood with leaden plugs; pieces of cloth being put under, impregnated with pitch) - after, I say, Hieron had completed the external figure of the vessel, he laboured at the interior.

[41.] G    "And the vessel was constructed with twenty banks of oars, and three entrances, having the lowest entrance leading to the hold, to which the descent was by two ladders of many steps each; and the next was contrived for those who wished to go down to the eating-rooms: and the third was for the armed men. And on each side of the middle entrance were apartments for the men, each with four couches in them, thirty in number. And the supper-room for the sailors was capable of holding fifteen couches, and it had within it three chambers, each containing three couches; and the kitchen was towards the stern of the ship. And all these rooms had floors composed of mosaic work, of all kinds of stones tesselated. And on this mosaic the whole story of the Iliad was depicted in a marvellous manner. And in all the furniture and the ceilings and the doors everything was executed and finished in the same admirable manner. And along the uppermost passage was a gymnasium and walks, having their appointment in all respects corresponding to the size of the vessel. And in them were gardens of all sorts of most wonderful beauty, enriched with all sorts of plants, and shaded by roofs of lead or tiles. And besides this there were tents roofed with boughs of white ivy and of the vine, the roots of which derived their moisture from casks full of earth, and were watered in the same manner as the gardens. And the tents themselves helped to shadow the walks. And next to those things was a temple devoted to Aphrodite, containing three couches, with a floor of agate and other most beautiful stones, of every sort which the island afforded. And its walls and its roof were made of cypress-wood, and its doors of ivory and fragrant cedar. And it was furnished in the most exquisite manner with pictures and statues, and with goblets and vases of every form and shape imaginable.

[42.] G   "And next to that was a drawing-room capable of containing five couches, with its walls and doors made of boxwood, having a book-case in it, and along the roof a clock, imitated from the sun-dial at Achradina. And there was also a bath-room, capable of containing three couches, having three brazen vessels for holding hot water, and a bath containing five measures of water, beautifully variegated with Tauromenian marble. And many rooms were also prepared for the marines, and for those who looked to the pumps. And besides all this there were ten stalls for horses on each side of the walls; and by them the fodder for the horses was kept, and the arms and furniture of the horsemen and of the boys. [208] There was also a cistern near the head of the ship, carefully shut, and containing two thousand measures of water, made of beams closely compacted with pitch and canvass. And next to the cistern there was a large water-tight well for fish, made so with beams of wood and lead. And it was kept full of sea-water, and great numbers of fish were kept in it. And on each side of the walls them were also projecting beams, placed at well-proportioned intervals; and to these were attached stores of wood, and ovens, and baking places, and mills, and many other useful offices. And all round the outside of the ship ran colossi [ atlases ] six cubits high, which supported the weight which was placed above them, and the triglyph, all being placed at convenient distances from one another. And the whole ship was adorned with suitable pictures.

[43.] G   "And in the vessel wore eight towers of a size proportioned to the burden of the ship, two at the stern, and as many at the head, and the rest in the middle of the ship. And to each of these were fastened two large beams, or yards, from which port-holes were fixed, through which stones were let down upon any enemy who might come against the ship. And on each of the towers stood four young men fully armed, and two archers. And the whole of the interior of the towers was full of stones and missiles. And a wall, having buttresses and decks, ran all through the ship, supported on trestles; and on these decks was placed a catapult, which hurled a stone weighing three talents, and an arrow twelve cubits long. And this engine was devised and made by Archimedes; and it could throw every arrow a stade. And besides all this, there were mats composed of stout ropes suspended by brazen chains; and as there were three masts, from each of them were suspended two large yards bearing stones, from which hooks and leaden weights were let down upon any enemy which might attack the vessel. And there was also a palisade all round the ship, made of iron, as a defence against those who might attempt to board it; and iron ravens, as they were called, all round the ship, which, being shot forth by engines, seized on the vessels of the enemy, and brought them round so as to expose them to blows. And on each of the sides of the ship stood sixty young men clad in complete armour; and an equal number stood on the masts, and on the yards which carried the stones; and they were also on the masts, up at the mast-head, which was made of brass. On the first there were three men, and on the second two, and on the third one. And they had stones brought up to them in wicker baskets by means of pulleys, and arrows were supplied to them by boys, within the defended parts of the mast-heads. And the vessels had four wooden anchors and eight iron ones. And of the masts, the second and third were easily found; but the first was procured with difficulty among the mountains of the Bruttii, and was discovered by a swineherd. And Phileas, an engineer of Tauromenium, brought it down to the seaside. And the hold, although of a most enormous depth, was pumped out by one man, by means of the screw, an engine which was the contrivance of Archimedes. And the name of the ship was 'The Syracusan;' but when Hieron sent it to sea, he altered its name and called it 'The Alexandrian.'

"And it had some small launches attached to it, the first of which was one of the light galleys called cercurus, able to hold a weight of three thousand talents; and it was wholly moved by oars. And after that came many galleys and skiffs of about fifteen hundred talents burthen. And the crew also was proportionately numerous; for besides the men who have been already mentioned, there were six hundred more, whose post was at the head of the ship, always watching for the orders of the captain. [209] And there was a tribunal instituted to judge of all offences which might be committed on board the ship, consisting of the captain and the pilot, and the officer of the watch; and they decided in every case according to the laws of the Syracusans.

[44.] G   "And they put on board the ship sixty thousand medimni of corn, and ten thousand jars of Sicilian salt-fish, and twenty thousand talents weight of wool, and of other cargo twenty thousand talents weight also. And besides all this, there were the provisions necessary for the crew. And Hieron, when he had understood that there was no harbour in Sicily large enough to admit this ship, and, moreover, that some of the harbours were dangerous for any vessel, determined to send it as a present to Alexandria to Ptolemy the king of Egypt. For there was a great dearth of corn in Egypt. And he did so; and the ship came to Alexandria, where it was put in port. And Hieron honoured Archimelus, also, the epigrammatic poet, who wrote an epigram on the ship, with a thousand medimni of wheat, which he also sent at his own expense to the Peiraeus; and the epigram runs thus - 
  Who placed this monstrous mass upon the earth; 
  What master led it with untiring cables, 
  How was the deck nailed to the mighty beams, 
  And with what axe did men the vessel form? 
  Surely it equals Aetna in its height, 
  Or any isle which rises from the sea 
  Where the Aegean wave entwined foams 
  Amid the Cyclades; on either side 
  Its breadth is equal, and its walls alike. 
  Sure 'twas the giants' work, who hoped to reach 
  By such vast ladder to the heights of heaven. 
  Its topmast reaches to the stars; and hides 
  Its mighty bulwarks 'mid the endless clouds. 
  It holds its anchors with untiring cables, 
  Like those with which proud Xerxes bound the strait. 
  Which between Sestus and Abydus foams. 
  A deftly carved inscription on the side 
  Shows what strong hand has launch'd it on the deep; 
  It says that Hieron, Hierocles' son, 
  The king of Sicily, pride of Dorian race, 
  Sends it a wealthy messenger of gifts 
  To the Aegean islands; and the god 
  Who rules the sea, great Poseidon, conveys it 
  Safe o'er the blue and foaming waves to Greece.

#  And I intentionally pass over the sacred trireme built by Antigonus, which defeated the commanders of Ptolemy off Leucolla, a city under the dominion of Cos; and after that, Antigonus consecrated it to Apollo; but it was not one-third, or perhaps not even one-fourth part of the size of the Syracusan or Alexandrian vessel."

[45.] G   All this, then, we have said about the catalogue of the ships, not beginning with the Boeotians, but with the shows and processions exhibited at public assemblies. And since I know that my excellent friend Ulpianus will attack us again, and ask what that thing is which Callixeinus calls ????????, we tell him that there is a speech which is attributed to Lysias the orator, written about the ????????, which begins with these words - "If, O judges, Lysimanes had said anything reasonable or moderate." And going on a little, he proceeds to say - "I should not have been eager to plead in an action about this chest (????????), which is not worth thirty drachmas." [210] And presently he tells us that the chest was a brazen one - "But when I wished last year to repair it, I gave it to a brazier; for it is well put together, and has the faces of Satyrs and large heads of oxen carved upon it. There is also another coffer of the same size; for the same workman made many such articles of the same size, and alike in many particulars." In these words Lysias, having said that the chest was made of brass, shows plainly enough, as Callixeinus also said, that they were things that might be used as stands for cauldrons. For so Polemon Periegetes said, in the third of those books of his which are addressed to Adaeus and Antigonus, where he explains the subject of the picture which is at Phlius, in the portico of the polemarchs, painted by Sillax the of Rhegium, who is mentioned by Epicharmus and Simonides. And his words are - "????????, and a large goblet on it." And Hegesander the Delphian, in his book entitled a Commentary on Statues and Images, says that the pedestal made by Glaucus the Chian at Delphi is like an iron ????????, the gift of Alyattes.  And that is mentioned by Herodotus [ 1.25 ], who calls it ?????????????? (a stand for a goblet). And Hegesander uses the same expression. And we ourselves have seen that lying at Delphi, a thing really worth looking at, on account of the figures of animals which are carved upon it, and of other insects, and living things, and plants . . . . can be put upon it, and goblets, and other furniture. But the thing which is called by the Alexandrians ???????? is a triangular vessel, hollow in the middle, capable of receiving an earthen wine-jar inside of it. And poor men have this made of wood, but rich men have it of brass or of silver.

[46.] G   [210] Having said this much about the ????????, let us now go on to speak of those kings who are and have been fond of good cheer. #  For the king who is the namesake of the above-mentioned Antiochus, and the son of Demetrius, according to the account of Poseidonius, used to entertain a great crowd of people every day, and in addition to what they ate on the spot, he would give every one of the guests large heaps, consisting of entire joints of meat of beasts, and birds, and fishes, undivided and ready dressed, enough to fill a wagon. And besides all this, he gave them heaps of honey-cake and of garlands, of myrrh, and frankincense, with large fillets and bandages, of golden embroidery as long as a man.  #  And another king, Antiochus, when celebrating the games at Daphne, himself also made very sumptuous entertainments, as Poseidonius himself relates; and he was the first person who ever made a distribution among the guests of whole joints of meat; and also of geese, and hares, and antelopes alive. And golden chaplets were also given to the guests, and a great quantity of silver plate, and of slaves, and horses, and camels. And each man was bound to get on the camel and drink a draught of wine, and then to accept of the camel and of the boy who stood by it. "And," says he, "all the natives and inhabitants of Syria, on account of the fertility of the land, are accustomed to make frequent feasts after their necessary labours, in order that they may rejoice together, using their gymnasia as baths, and anointing themselves with expensive oil and perfumes; and at their grammateia (for that is the name which they give to their public entertainments) living as if in their own houses, and gratifying their stomachs the greater part of the day with wine and meat, and also carrying away a quantity of the wine to their own homes, they thus spend the day, listening also to the music of the loud lyre made of the tortoise shell, so that whole cities resound with noises of this kind."

[47.] G   [211] #  And I, my friends, praise very much the entertainment which was given by Alexander the king of Syria. And this Alexander was a pretended son of Antiochus Epiphanes, substituted on account of the hatred which all men bore to Demetrius, concerning whom our companion Athenaeus has spoken in his treatise on the Kings who have reigned in Syria. Now that entertainment was conducted as nearly as may be in this fashion. Diogenes the Epicurean, having a very tolerable acquaintance with the doctrines of the sect which he professed, was by birth a native of Seleuceia, in the district of Babylon. And he was kindly received by the king, although the monarch rather inclined to the doctrines of the Stoic school. Accordingly, Alexander treated him with great distinction, although a man of anything but a reputable course of life, and so given to calumny and envy, that if he could raise a laugh by it, he could not abstain from even the king himself. And when he preferred to the king a request that had no great connection with philosophy -- namely, that he might be allowed to wear a purple robe and a golden crown, having a face of Virtue in the centre of it, as he claimed to be addressed as the priest of Virtue, he agreed to it all, and besides that, made him a present of the crown. And these ornaments Diogenes, being in love with a woman who played male roles (????????), gave to her. But Alexander, hearing of this, collected a banquet party of philosophers and eminent men and among them he invited Diogenes. And when he arrived he begged him to take his seat with his crown and his purple robe on, And when he replied that that would be unseemly, the king nodded to his servants to introduce the musicians, among whom this singing woman appeared, crowned with the crown of Virtue, and clothed also in the purple rube. So when every one burst into laughter at this, the philosopher kept quiet, and never stopped praising the singing woman.

But Antiochus, who succeeded Alexander in the kingdom, could not tolerate the abusive language of this Diogenes, and accordingly ordered him to be put to death. But Alexander was at all times, and in all circumstances, of a gentle disposition, and affable to every one in conversation, and not at all like Athenion the Peripatetic philosopher, who had a philosophical school at Athens, and at Messene, and also at Larissa in Thessaly, and who subsequently became tyrant of Athens; concerning whom Poseidonius of Apameia gives a very particular account [ Fr_36 ], which I, even though it is rather long, will quote, in order that we may come to a thorough understanding and appreciation of those men who profess to be philosophers, and that we may not be taken in by their ragged cloaks and unshaven chins. For, as Agathon says -- 
  If I do tell the truth I can not please you; 
  And if I please you, I shall speak no truth. 
But "let truth," as the saying is, "be one's friend." At all events, I will quote the account given of the man.

[48.] G   #  "In the school of Erymneus the Peripatetic there was a certain man of the name of Athenion, who applied himself very perseveringly to philosophical discussions. He, having bought an Egyptian female slave, made her his mistress. And when she became a mother, either by him or by some one else, the child was bred up by Athenion, and received the same name as his master. And having been taught literature, he became accustomed to lead his master about when he became an old man, in company with his mother; and when he died he succeeded him as his heir, and became a citizen of Athens, being enrolled under the name of Athenion. And having married a very beautiful girl, after that he betook himself to the profession of a sophist, hunting out for boys to come to his school. And having pursued his profession of sophist at Messene and at Larissa in Thessaly, [212] and having amassed a considerable fortune, he returned to Athens. And having been appointed an ambassador by the Athenian people, when the chief power in all that district was lodged in the hands of Mithridates, he insinuated himself into the good graces of the king and became one of his friends, being held by him in the greatest honour; in consequence of which he wrote letters to the Athenians to raise their spirits, as one who had the greatest influence with the king of Cappadocia, leading them to hope that they should be discharged of all their existing debts, and live in peace and concord with him; and also that they should recover their democratic constitution, and receive great presents both publicly and privately. And the Athenians boasted of all these promises which were made to them, feeling sure that the supremacy of the Romans would be put an end to.

[49.] G   "Now when all Asia had revolted to the King, Athenion set out to return to Athens; and being tossed about by a storm he was driven to Carystus. And when the Cecropidae heard this, they sent some ships of war to conduct him back, and a litter with silver feet. And now he is entering the city; and almost the whole of the citizens has poured out to meet him; and many other spectators came together, marvelling at this preposterous freak of fortune, that this intrusive citizen, Athenion, foisted into Athens in such a manner, should be conducted into the city on a litter with silver feet, and lying on purple clothes, a man who had never before seen even a purple patch on his ragged cloak; when no one, not even of the Romans, had ever exhibited such pomp and insulting show in Attica before. So there ran to this spectacle men, women, children, all expecting some glorious honours from Mithridates. While Athenion that ancient beggar, who gave lectures for trifling sums of money, was now making a procession through the country and through the city, relying on the king's favour, and treating every one with great insolence. There met him also the artisans of the spectacles of Dionysus callimg him a messenger of the young Dionysus, and inviting him to the common altar, and to the prayers and libations which were to be offered at it; and he, who had formerly come out of a hired house, was conducted into the mansion of Dies, a person who at that time enjoyed great wealth from revenues in Delos; it was adorned with couches, and pictures, and statues, and a display of silver plate. And from it he issued forth, dragging on the ground a bright cloak, and with a golden ring on his finger, having on it a carved portrait of Mithridates. And numbers of attendants went before him and followed him in procession. And in the plot of ground belonging to the artisans, sacrifices were performed in honour of the return of Athenion, and libations made with formal proclamation by a herald. And the next day many people came to his house and awaited his appearance; and the whole Cerameicus was full of citizens and foreigners, and there was a voluntary thronging of the whole population of the city to the assembly. And at last he came forth, being attended by all who wished to stand well with the people, as if they had been his bodyguards, every one hastening even to touch his garment.

[50.] G   "He then having ascended the tribunal which had been erected for the Roman generals in front of the portico of Attalus, standing on it and looking round on all the people in a circle, and then looking up, said, 'O men of Athens, the state of affairs and the interests of my country compel me to relate to you what I know. But the greatness of the affairs that must be mentioned, owing to the unexpected character which circumstances have assumed, hinders me from doing so.' [213] And when all the bystanders called out to him with one accord to be of good cheer, and to tell them, 'I tell you, then,' said he, 'of things which have never been hoped for, nor even imagined by any one in a dream. The king Mithridates is master of Bithynia, and of Upper Cappadocia; and is master of the whole of Asia, without any break, as far as Pamphylia and Cilicia: and the kings of the Armenians and Persians are only his guards; and he is lord of all the nations which dwell around the Palus Maeotis, and the whole of Pontus, so that his dominions are upwards of thirty thousand furlongs in circumference. And the Roman commander in Pamphylia, Quintus Oppius, has been surrendered to him, and is following him as a prisoner, but Manius Aquillius, a man of consular rank, who has celebrated a triumph for his victory over the Sicilians, is fastened by a long chain a Bastarnian, five cubits tall, and is dragged by him on foot at the tail of his horse. And of the other Roman citizens in Asia some have fallen down at the images of the gods, and the rest have put on square cloaks and acknowledge again the claims of their original country. And every city honouring him with more than human honours, calls the king a god; and oracles everywhere promise him the dominion over the whole world, on which account he is new sending large armies against Thrace and Macedonia, and every part of Europe is coming over bodily to his side. For ambassadors are coming to him, not only from the Italian tribes, but also from the Carthaginians, begging him to enter into alliance with them for the destruction of the Romans.'

[51.] G   "Having stopped a little after saying this, and having given time for the multitude to converse together about the news thus unexpectedly announced to them, he wiped his face, and went on, 'What then do I advise?-- Not to bear this state of anarchy any longer, which the Roman senate makes continue, while it is deciding what constitution you are to enjoy for the future. And do not let us be indifferent to our temples being closed, to our gymnasia being left in the dirt, to our theatre being always empty, and our courts of justice mute, and the Pnyx, consecrated by the oracles of the gods, being taken from the people. Let us not, O Athenians, be indifferent to the sacred voice of Iacchus being reduced to silence, to the holy temple of Demeter and Persephone being closed, and to the schools of the philosophers being silenced as they are.'  And when this slave had said all this and a good deal more, the multitude conversing with one another and running together to the theatre elected Athenion general over the entire army. And then, the Peripatetic coming into the orchestra, walking like Pythocles, thanked the Athenians, and said, 'Now you yourselves are your own generals, and I am the commander-in-chief: and if you exert all your strength to co-operate with me I shall be able to do as much as all of you put together.' And he, having said this, appointed others to be his colleagues in the command, proposing whatever names he thought desirable.

[52.] G   "And a few days afterwards, the philosopher having thus appointed himself tyrant, and having proved how much weight is to be attached to the doctrine of the Pythagoreans about plots against others, and what was the practical effect of the philosophy which the admirable Pythagoras laid down, as Theopompus has related in the eighth book of his Philippics, and Hermippus, the pupil of Callimachus, has corroborated the account, [214] he immediately removed all the citizens who were right-thinking and of a good disposition (contrary to the sentiments of, and rules laid down by, Aristotle and Theophrastus; showing how true is tho proverb which says, Do not put a sword into the hand of a child) and he placed sentinels at the gates, so that many of the Athenians, fearing what he might be going to do, let themselves down over the walls by night, and so fled away. And Athenion sending some horsemen to pursue them slew some of them, and brought back some in chains, having a number of bodyguards about his person of the kind called cataphracts.  #  And often he convened assemblies, pretending great attachment to the side of the Romans ... and bringing accusations against many as having kept up communications with the exiles, and aiming at a revolution, he put them to death. And he placed thirty guards at each gate, and would not allow any one to go either in or out. And he seized on the property of many of the people, and collected such a quantity of money as to fill several wells; and he also sent all over the country people to lie in wait, as it were, for every one who was travelling, and they brought them to him; and he put them to death without any trial, torturing and racking them into the bargain. And he also instituted prosecutions for treason against several people, saying that they were co-operating with the exiles to effect their return. And some of those who were prosecuted fled out of fear before the trials came on, and some were condemned before the tribunals, he himself giving his own vote and collecting those of the others. And he brought about in the city a scarcity of the things necessary for life, depriving the citizens of their proper quantity of barley and wheat. He also sent out heavy-armed soldiers over the country, to hunt out any of those who had fled and who could be found within the borders of the land, or any of the Athenians who were escaping beyond the borders. And whoever was detected he beat to death; and some of them he exhausted beforehand with tortures; and he caused proclamation to be made, that all must be in their houses by sunset, and that no one should presume to walk outside with a lantern-bearer.

[53.] G   #  "And he not only plundered the property of the citizens, but that of foreigners also, laying his hands even on the property of the god at Delos; sending into the island Apellicon of Teos, who had become a citizen of Athens, and who lived a most whimsical and ever-changing course of life. For at one time he was a philosopher, and collected all the treatises of the Peripatetics, and the whole library of Aristotle, and many others; for he was a very rich man; and he had also stolen a great many original copies of decrees of the ancients out of the Metroon, and whatever else there was ancient and rare in other cities; and being detected in these practices at Athens he would have been in great danger if he had not made his escape; and a short time afterwards he returned again, having paid his court to many people, and he then joined himself to Athenion, as being a man of the same sect as he was. And Athenion, having forgotten the doctrines of the Peripatetics, measured out a choenix of bailey, as four days' allowance for the ignorant Athenians, giving them what was barely food enough for fowl, and not the proper nutriment for men. And Apellicon, coming in great force to Delos, and living there more like a man exhibiting a spectacle than a general with soldiers, and placing guards in a very careless manner on the side of Delos, and having all the back of the island unguarded, and not even putting down a palisade in front of his camp, went to rest. [215] And Orobius, the Roman general, hearing of this, who was at that time in command at Delos, watching for a moonless night, led out his troops, and falling on Apellicon and his soldiers, who were all asleep and drunk, he cut the Athenians and all those who were in the army with them to pieces, like so many sheep, to the number of six hundred, and he took four hundred alive. And that fine general, Apellicon, fled away without being perceived, and came to Delos; and Orobius seeing that many of those who fled with him had escaped to the farmhouses round about, burnt them in the houses, houses and all; and he destroyed by fire also all the engines for besieging cities together with the Helepolis which Apellicon had made when he came to Delos. And Orobius having erected in that place a trophy and an altar, wrote this inscription on it -- 
  This tomb contains the foreigners here slain, 
  Who fought near Delos, and who fell at sea, 
  When the Athenians spoiled the holy isle, 
  Aiding in war the Cappadocian king."

[54.] G   There was also at Tarsus an Epicurean philosopher who had become the tyrant of that city, Lysias by name; who having been created by his countrymen Stephanephorus, that is to say, the priest of Heracles, did not lay down his command, but seized on the tyranny. He put on a purple tunic with a white centre, and over that he wore a very superb and costly cloak, and he put on white Lacedaemonian sandals, and assumed also a crown of golden laurel leaves. And he distributed the property of the rich among the poor, and put many to death who did not surrender their property willingly.

[55.] G   These are the commanders who became such from having been philosophers; concerning whom Demochares said,- "Just as no one could make a spear out of a bulrush, so no one could make a faultless general out of Socrates." For Plato says [ Apol_28'e ] that Socrates served in three military expeditions, one to Potidaea, and another to Amphipolis, and another against the Boeotians, in which last it was that the battle of Delium took place. And though no one has mentioned this circumstance, he himself says that he gained the prize of the most eminent valour, since all the other Athenians fled, and many were slain. But all this is an erroneous statement. For the expedition against Amphipolis took place in the archonship of Alcaeus, when Cleon was the general; and it was composed entirely of picked men, as Thucydides relates [ 5.2 ]. Socrates then, a man who had nothing but his ragged cloak and his stick, must have been one of these picked men. But what historian or poet has mentioned this fact? Or where has Thucydides made the slightest mention of Socrates, this soldier of Plato's? And what is there in common between a shield and a philosopher's staff? And when was it that Socrates bore a part in the expedition against Potidaea, as Plato has said in his Charmides [ 153'b ], where he states that he then yielded the prize of preeminent valour to Alcibiades? though Thucydides has not mentioned it, nor has Isocrates in his Oration on the Pair-horse Chariot. And what battle ever took place when Socrates gained the prize of preeminent valour? And what eminent and notorious exploit did he perform; for indeed there was actually no battle at all at that time, as Thucydides tells us.

But Plato not being content with all these strange stories, introduces the valour which was displayed, or rather which was invented by him at Delium. For if Socrates had even taken Delium, as Herodicus the follower of Crates has reported in his Against Philo-socrates, he would have fled disgracefully as all the rest did, when Pagondas sent two squadrons of cavalry unperceived round the hill. For then some of the Athenians fled to Delium, [216] and some fled to the sea, and some to Oropus, and some to Mount Parnes. And the Boeotians, especially with their cavalry, pursued them and slew them; and the Locrian cavalry joined in the pursuit and slaughter. When then this disorder and alarm had seized upon the Athenians, did Socrates alone, looking proud and casting his eyes around, stand firm, turning aside the onset of the Boeotian and Locrian cavalry? And yet does Thucydides make no mention of this valour of his, nor even any poet either. And how was it that he yielded to Alcibiades the prize of preeminent valour, who had absolutely never joined in this expedition at all? But in the Crito [ 52'b ], Plato, that favourite of Memory, says that Socrates had never once gone out of Attica, except when he once went to the Isthmian games. And Antisthenes, the Socratic philosopher, tells the same tale as Plato about the Aristeia; but the story is not true. For this Dog flatters Socrates in many particulars, on which account we must not believe either of them, keeping Thucydides for our guide. For Antisthenes even exaggerates this false story, saying,- " 'But we hear that you also received the prize of preeminent valour in the battle which took place against the Boeotians.' 'Be quiet, my friend, the prize belongs to Alcibiades, not to me.' 'Yes, but you gave it to him as we are told.' " But Plato's Socrates says that he was present at Potidaea, and that he yielded the prize of preeminent valour to Alcibiades on that occasion. But by the universal consent of all historians the expedition against Potidaea, in which Phormion commanded, was previous to the one against Delium.

[56.] G   In every respect then the philosophers tell lies; and they are not aware that they commit numbers of anachronisms in the accounts which they give. And even the admirable Xenophon is not free from this error. For he in his Symposium [ 1'2 ] introduces Callias, the son of Hipponicus, as the lover of Autolycus, the son of Lycon, and making an entertainment in his honour when he gained the victory in the Pancratium. And he represents himself as being present with the rest of the guests, when he perhaps was either not born, or at all events not out of childhood. And this is the time when Aristion was archon. For it was in his archonship that Eupolis exhibited the comedy Autolycus, in which, in the character of Demostratus, he ridicules the victory of Autolycus. And again Xenophon makes Socrates say at this banquet [ 8'32 ] -- "And Pausanias, indeed, the lover of Agathon the poet, when speaking in excuse of those who allow themselves to indulge in intemperance, said that a most valiant army might be composed of boys and their lovers: for that of all the men in the world they would be the most ashamed to desert one another. Saying a very strange thing,-- if men who are accustomed utterly to disregard all blame, and to behave with utter shamelessness to one another, would be the men above all others ashamed to do anything disgraceful."  But that Pausanias never said anything of the sort we may see from the Symposium of Plato. For I know of no book at all which is written by Pausanias. Nor is he introduced by any one else as speaking of lovers and boys, but only by Plato. But whether Xenophon has absolutely invented this story, or whether he fell in with any edition of Plato's Symposium which reports what happened in a different manner, is of no importance; still we must take notice of the blunder as far as the time is concerned. Aristion, in whose time this banquet is represented as having taken place, was archon four years before Euphemus, [217] in whose archonship Plato places the banquet given in honour of the victory of Agathon, at which banquet Pausanias said these things about lovers. So that it is a marvellous and incredible thing that Socrates when supping with Callias should find fault with things as having been said erroneously, which had not yet been said at all, and which were not said till four years afterwards at the banquet of Agathon.

[57.] G   But altogether Plato's Symposium is mere nonsense. For when Agathon got the victory Plato was fourteen years old. For the former was crowned at the Lenaea in the archonship of Euphemus. But Plato was born in the year of the archonship of Apollodorus, who succeeded Euthydemus. And when he was eighty-two years old he died in the archonship of Theophilus, who succeeded Callimachus; for he is the eighty-second archon after Apollodorus. But from the archonship of Apollodorus and the birth of Plato, Euphemus is the fourteenth archon; and it is in his archonship that the banquet was given in honour of the victory of Agathon. And Plato himself shows that this entertainment had taken place a long time before, saying in the Symposium [ 172'c ] " ... 'Do you think then that this entertainment has taken place but lately, so that I could have been present at it?' 'Indeed I do,' said he. 'How could that be,' said I, 'O Glaucon? Do you not know that Agathon has not been in the city for many years?' " And then a little while after he says - " 'But tell me, when did this entertainment take place?' And I replied, 'When we were still children, when Agathon gained the prize in tragedy.' " But that Plato makes many blunders in his chronology is plain from many circumstances. For as the poet said - "The man has a tongue which pays no regard to seasons;" so he writes without sufficient discernment. For he never spoke at random, but (?) not with great consideration.

[58.] G   As for instance, writing in the Gorgias [ 471'a ], he says - " 'Archelaus, then, according to your definition, is a miserable man.' 'Yes, my friend, if, at least, he is an unjust one.' " And then, after expressly stating that Archelaus was possessed of the kingdom of the Macedonians, he goes on to say [ 503'c ], that Pericles also was lately dead. But if Pericles had only lately died, Archelaus was not yet in the enjoyment of his dominions at all; and if Archelaus was king at the time, then Pericles had been dead a long time. Now Perdiccas was king before Archelaus, according to the statement of Nicomedes of Acanthus; and he reigned forty-one years. But Theopompus says he reigned thirty-five years; Anaximenes, forty; Hieronymus, twenty-eight. But Marsyas and Philochorus [ Fr_126 ] say that he reigned only twenty-three years. Now, as these all vary so much in their accounts, we will take the smallest number, and say twenty-three. But Pericles died in the third year of the Peloponnesian war, in the archonship of Epameinon, in which year also Alexander died, and Perdiccas succeeded him in the kingdom. And he reigned till the archonship of Callias, in whose year Perdiccas died, and Archelaus succeeded to the kingdom. How, then, can Pericles have died lately, as Plato phrases it? And in the same Gorgias [ 473'e ] Plato represents Socrates as saying - "And last year, when I drew the lot to be one of the council, when my tribe was the presiding tribe, and I had to put the question to the vote, I caused the people to laugh, as I did not know how to put the question to the vote." Now Socrates did not fall into this error out of ignorance, but out of his firm principles of virtue; for he did not choose to violate the laws of the democracy. And Xenophon shows this plainly in the first book of his Hellenica [ 1.7'14 ], where he gives the following account:- "But when some of the prytaneis said that they would not put the question contrary to the laws, [218] Callixeinus again mounts the tribunal and inveighs against them; and they cried out that he should impeach those who refused. And the prytaneis being alarmed, all agreed to put the question except Socrates the son of Sophroniscus; and he said that he would not, but that he would do everything according to the laws."

This was the question which was put to the vote against the generals, Erasinides and his colleagues, because they did not pick up the men who were lost in the naval battle at Arginusae. And this battle took place in the archonship of Callias, twenty-four years after the death of Pericles.

[64.] G   [221] When Masurius had said this, and when all had admired his wisdom, after silence was restored Ulpianus said,-- You seem to me, O guests, to be overwhelmed with impetuous speeches which come upon you unexpectedly, and to be thoroughly soaked in unmixed wine;-- 
  For a man drinking wine, as a horse does water, 
  Speaks like a Scythian, not knowing even koppa, 
  But voiceless, lies immersed in a cask, 
  And sleeps as if he'd drunk medicinal poppy 
as says Parmenon the Byzantian. Have you been all turned into stone by the before-mentioned Gorgons? Concerning whom, that there really have been some animals who were the causes of men being turned into stone, Alexander the Myndian speaks at length, in the second book of his history of Beasts, saying -- "The Numidians in Libya (where it is born) call the animal named the Gorgon, 'The Looking-down:' and it is as most people say, conjecturing from its skin, something like a wild sheep; but as some say, it is like a calf. And they say that it has such breath that it destroys every one who meets it; and that it has a mane let down from its forehead over its eyes, and when it has shaken it aside, which it does with difficulty by reason of its weight, and then looks out through it, it slays the man who is beheld by it, not by its breath, but by some natural violence which proceeds from its eyes. #  And it was discovered in this way: Some of the soldiers of Marius, in his expedition against Jugurtha, having beheld the Gorgon, thought because it held its head down, and moved slowly, that it was a wild sheep, and in consequence they rushed upon it, intending to kill it with the swords which they had about them; but it, being disturbed, shaking aside the mane which hung down ever its eyes, immediately caused the death of those who were rushing upon it. And when others again and again did the same thing, and lost their lives by so doing, and when all who proceeded against it were invariably killed, some of the soldiers inquired the nature of the animal from the natives; and by the command of Marius some Numidian horsemen laid an ambush against it from a distance, and shot it with javelins, and returned to the camp bringing the dead monster to the general."  And that this account is the true one, the skin and the expedition of Marius both prove. But the statement made by the historian is not credible, namely, that there are in Libya some oxen which are called Opisthonomi, because they do not advance while feeding, but feed constantly returning backwards, for their horns are a hindrance to their feeding in the natural manner, inasmuch as they are not bent upwards, as is the case with all other animals, but they bend downwards and overshadow the eyes; for this is incredible, since no other historian testifies to such a circumstance.

[65.] G   When Ulpianus had said this, Larensis bearing witness to the truth of his statement, and adding something to his speech, said, that Marius sent the skins of those animals to Rome, and that no one could conjecture to what animal they belonged, on account of the singular appearance which they presented; and that these skins were hung up in the temple of Hercules, in which the generals who celebrate a triumph give a banquet to the citizens, [222] as many poets and historians of our nation have related. You then, O grammarians, as the Babylonian Herodicus says, inquiring into none of these matters-- 
  Fly ye to Greece along the sea's wide back, 
  Pupils of Aristarchus, all more timid 
  Than the pale antelope, worms hid in holes, 
  Monosyllabic animals, who care 
  For ???? and ????, and for ??? and ???, 
  This shall be your lot, grumblers -- but let Greece 
  And sacred Babylon receive Herodicus.

For, as Anaxandrides the comic writer says --, 
  'Tis sweet when one has planned a new device, 
  To tell it to the world. For those who are 
  Wise for themselves alone have, first of all, 
  No judge to criticise their new invention. 
  And envy is their portion too: for all 
  That seems to be commended by its novelty, 
  Should be imparted freely to the people.

And when this conversation had terminated, most of the guests took their departure separately, and so broke up the party.

[15.] G   [229] But with respect to the use of silver plate, my good friend Ulpianus, you make me stop to consider a little; but I recollect what is said by Alexis in his Exile :- 
  For where an earthen pot is to be let 
  For the cook's use.

For down to the times of the supremacy of the Macedonians the attendants used to perform their duties with vessels made of earthenware, as my countryman Juba declares. But when the Romans altered the way of living, giving it a more expensive direction, then Cleopatra, arranging her style of living in imitation of them, she, I mean, who ultimately destroyed the Egyptian monarchy, not being able to alter the name, she called gold and silver plate ??????? ; and then she gave the guests what she called the ?????? to carry away with them; and this was very costly. And on the Rhosic earthenware, which was the most beautiful, Cleopatra spent five minae every day. But Ptolemy the king, in the eighth book of his commentaries, writing of Masinissa the king of the Libyans, speaks as follows :- "His entertainments were arranged in the Roman fashion, everything being served up in silver ???????. And the second course he arranged in the Italian mode. His dishes were all made of gold; made after the fashion of those which are plaited of bulrushes or ropes. And he employed Greek musicians."

[16.] G   But Aristophanes the comic writer, whom Heliodorus the Athenian says, in his treatise concerning the Acropolis, (and it occupies fifteen books,) was a native of Naucratis, in his play called Plutus, after the god who gave his name to the play and appeared on the stage, says that dishes of silver were in existence, just as all other things might be had made of the same metal. And his words are :- 
  But every vinegar cruet, dish and ewer 
  Is made of brass; while all the dirty dishes 
   In which they serve up fish are made of silver. 
  The oven too is made of ivory.

And Plato says, in his Ambassadors :- 
  Epicrates and his good friend Phormisius, 
  Received many and magnificent gifts 
  From the great king ; a golden cruet-stand, 
  And silver plates and dishes.

[230] And Sophron, in his Female Actresses, says: - 
  The whole house shone 
  With store of gold, and of much silver plate.

[17.] G   And Philippides, in his Disappearance of Silver, speaks of the use of it as ostentatious and uncommon, and aimed at only by some foreigners who had made fortunes but lately :- 
  (A)   I felt a pity for all human things, 
  Seeing men nobly born to ruin hasting, 
  And branded slaves eating on silver plates 
  The salt-fish bought for two or three obols, 
   Or three coppers' worth of capers in a silver bowl 
  Whose weight is fifty drachmas of purest silver. 
  And formerly it would have been hard to see 
  One single flagon vowed unto the gods. 
  (B)   That is still true now. 
  For if one man should vow 
  A gift like that, some other man would steal it.

And Alexis, in his Little House, introducing a young man in love displaying his wealth to his mistress, represents him as making her some such speech as this :- 
  (A)   I told the slaves, (for I brought two from home,) 
  To place the carefully wiped silver vessels 
  Fairly in sight. There was a silver goblet, 
  And cups which weighed two drachmas; a beaker too 
  Whose weight was four ; a wine-cooler, ten obols, 
  Slighter than even Philippides' own self. 
  (B)   And yet these things are not so ill-contrived 
  To make a show . .. .

And I am myself acquainted with one of our own fellow-citizens who is as proud as he is poor, and who, when all his silver plate put together scarcely weighed a drachma, used to keep calling for his servant, a single individual, and the only one he had, but still he called him by hundreds of different names. "Here, you Strombichides, do not put on the table any of my winter plate, but my summer plate." And the character in Nicostratus, in the play entitled The Kings, is just such another. There is a braggart soldier, of whom he speaks - 
  There is some vinegar and a wine-cooler, 
  Thinner than thinnest gauze.

For there were at that time people who were able to beat out silver till it was as thin as a piece of skin.

[18.] G   And Antiphanes, in his Lemnian Women, says :- 
  A three-legged table now is laid, and on it 
  A luscious cheesecake, ye honoured gods, 
  And this year's honey in a silver dish.

And Sopater the parodist, in his Orestes, writes :- 
  A silver dish, bearing a stinking shad.

And in the drama entitled Lentil Soup he says :- 
  But at his supper he does sport a cruet 
  Of shining silver, richly chased with figures, 
  And bas-reliefs of dragons : such as Thibron 
  Used to display, most delicate of men, 
  Stripped of his talents by the arts of Tantalus.

And Theopompus the Chian, in his Letters of Advice to Alexander, when he enters into a discussion about Theocritus his fellow-citizen, says:- "But he drinks out of silver cups and out of golden cups, and uses other vessels of the same kind upon his table. A man who formerly not only did not drink out of silver vessels, but who had not brazen ones either; he used to be content with the commonest earthenware, and even that very often cracked and chipped."

And Diphilus says, in his Painter :- 
  A splendid breakfast then appeared, consisting 
  [231] Of all that was desirable or new ; 
  First every kind of oyster ; then a phalanx 
  Of various side-dishes, and a heap 
  Of broiled meats fresh from the gridiron, 
  And potted meats in silver mortars pounded.

And Philemon says in his Physician :- 
  And a large basket full of silver plate.

And Menander, in his Self-Tormentor, says- 
  A bath, maid-servants, lots of silver plate.

And in his Hymnis he writes - 
  But I am come in quest of silver plate.

And Lysias, in his Oration on the Golden Tripod, if indeed the speech be a genuine one of his, says :- "It was still possible to give silver or gold plate." But those who pride themselves on the purity of their Greek, say that the proper expression should "silver ornament" and "gold ornament".

  * * * * *

[22.] G   [232] And Ephorus, or Demophilus, his son, in the thirtieth book of his Histories, speaking of the temple of Delphi, says, "But Onomarchus and Phayllus and Phalaecus not only carried off all the treasures of the god, but at last their wives carried off also the ornaments of Eriphyle, which Alcmaeon consecrated at Delphi by the command of the god, and also the necklace of Helen, which had been given by Menelaus. For the god had given each of them oracles: he had said to Alcmaeon, when he asked him how he could be cured of his madness - 
  You ask a precious gift, relief from madness; 
  Give me a precious gift yourself; the chain 
  With which your mother buried, steeds and all, 
  Your sire, her husband, brave Amphiaraus.

And he replied to Menelaus, who consulted him as to how he might avenge himself on Paris - 
  Bring me the golden ornament of the neck 
  Of your false wife; which Aphrodite once did give 
  A welcome gift to Helen; and then Paris 
  Shall glut your direst vengeance by his fall.

[233] And it so fell out that a violent quarrel arose among the women about these ornaments - which should take which. and when they had drawn lots for the choice, the one of them, who was very ugly and stern, got Eriphyle's necklace, but the one who was conspicuous for beauty and wanton got the ornaments of Helen; and she, being in love with a young man of Epirus, went away with him, but the other contrived to put her husband to death."

[23.] G   But the divine Plato, and Lycurgus the Lacedaemonian, not only forbade all costly ornaments to be introduced into their model states, but they would not permit even silver or gold to be brought into them, thinking that of the products of mines, iron and copper were sufficient, and banishing the other metals as injurious to those states which were in good order. But Zenon the Stoic, thinking everything unimportant except the legitimate and honest use of the precious metals, forbade either wishing for or denouncing them; but still he recommended chiefly the use of those which were more commonly accessible and less superfluous; in order that men, having the dispositions of their minds formed so as neither to fear nor to admire anything which is not honourable on the one hand or discreditable on the other, should use only what is natural as much as possible, and yet should not fear what is of an opposite character, but abstain from such in obedience to reason and not to fear. For nature has not banished any of the above-mentioned things out of the world, but has made subterranean veins of these metals, the working of which is very laborious and difficult in order that they who desire such things may arrive at the acquisition after toil and suffering; and that not only those men themselves who work in the mines, but those also who collect what has been extracted from the mines, may acquire this much wished for opulence at the expense of countless labours.

Therefore a little of these metals lies on the surface just to serve as a sample of the rest which is beneath, since in the remotest corners of the earth also there are rivers bearing down gold-dust in their waters; and women and men destitute of bodily strength scratching among the sand, detach these particles from the sand, and then they wash them and bring them to the smelting-pot, as my countryman Poseidonius says [ Fr_48 ] is done among the Helvetii, and among others of the Celtic tribes. And the mountains which used formerly to be called the Rhipaean mountains, and which were subsequently named the Olbian (as if happy), and which are now called the Alps, (they are mountains in Gaul,) when once the woods upon them had caught fire spontaneously, ran with liquid silver. The greater quantity of this metal, however, is found by mining operations carried on at a great depth, and attended by great hardship, according to the statement of Demetrius Phalereus, in consequence of the desire of avarice to draw Pluto himself out of the recesses of the earth; and, accordingly, he says facetiously that - "Men having often abandoned what was visible for the sake of what was uncertain, have not got what they expected, and have lost what they had, being unfortunate by an enigmatical sort of calamity."

[24.] G   But the Lacedaemonians being forbidden by their national institutions from introducing gold or silver into Sparta, as the same Poseidonius relates, or from possessing any in private, did possess it nevertheless, but then they deposited it among their neighbours the Arcadians. But subsequently the Arcadians became enemies to them instead of friends, as they had been; picking a quarrel with them with the express view of seizing on this deposit without being called to account for it, by reason of the enmity now subsisting. Therefore it is said that the gold and silver which had formerly been at Lacedaemon was consecrated at Delphi to Apollo; and that when Lysander brought gold publicly into the city he was the cause of many evils to the state by so doing. [234] And it is said that Gylippus, who liberated the Syracusans, was put to death by starvation, having been condemned by the ephors, because he had embezzled some of the money sent to Sparta by Lysander. But that which had been devoted to the god and been granted to the people as a public ornament and public property, it was not decent for any mortal to treat with contempt.

[25.] G   That tribe of Gauls which is called the Scordistae, does not introduce gold into their country either, but still they are not the less ready to plunder the territories of their neighbours, and to commit injustice;  # and that nation is a remnant of the Gauls who formed the army of Brennus when he made his expedition against the temple of Delphi. And a certain Bathanattus, acting as their leader, settled them as a colony in the districts around the Ister, from whom they call the road by which they returned the Bathanattan road, and even to this day they call his posterity the Bathanatti. And these men shun gold, and do not introduce it into their territories, as a thing on account of which they have suffered many calamities; but they do use silver, and for the sake of that they commit the most enormous atrocities. Although the proper course would be, not to banish the whole class of the thing of which they were formerly plundered, but the impiety which could perpetrate such a sacrilege. And even if they did not introduce silver into their country, still they would commit excesses in the pursuit of copper and iron; and even if they had not these things, still they would continue to rage in war against other nations for the sake of meat and drink, and other necessaries.

[26.] G   [234] When Pontianus had delivered his opinion in these terms, and while most of the guests were endeavouring to solve the questions proposed by Ulpianus, Plutarchus, being one of those who was attending to the other subjects of discussion, said,- The name parasite was in former days a respectable and a holy name. At all events, Polemon (whether he was a Samian or a Sicyonian, or whether he prefers the name of an Athenian, which Heracleides of Mopsuestia gives him, who also speaks of him as being claimed by other cities; and he was also called Stelocopas, as Herodicus the pupil of Crates has told us,) writing about parasites, speaks as follows - "The name of parasite is now a disreputable one; but among the ancients we find the word parasite used as something sacred, and nearly equivalent to the title Messmate. Accordingly, at Cynosarges, in the temple of Heracles, there is a pillar on which is engraved a decree of Alcibiades; the clerk who drew it up being Stephanus the son of Thucydides; and in it mention is made of this name in the following terms - 'Let the priest perform the monthly sacrifices with the parasites; and let the parasites be selected from the men of mixed race, and from the sons of the same, according to the usual national customs; and whoever is unwilling to take the place of a parasite, let the priest report him to the tribunal.' And in the tables of the laws concerning the Delian sacred mission it is written - 'And let two heralds, of the family of the heralds, of that branch of it which is occupied about the sacred mysteries, be chosen; and let them be parasites in the temple of Delos for a year.' And in Pallenis this inscription is engraved on the offerings there found - 'The magistrates and parasites made these offerings, who, in the archonship of Pythodorus, were crowned with a golden crown; and the parasites were, when ... was priestess, Epilycus, son of ... of Gargettus; Pericles, son of Pericleitus of Pitthis; Charinus, son of Demochares of Gargettus.' And in the laws of the king, we find the following words - 'That the parasites of the Acharnians shall sacrifice to Apollo.' But Clearchus of Soli, and he was one of the disciples of Aristotle, in the first book of his Lives, writes thus - [235] 'But now they call a parasite a man who is ready for anything; but in former times he was a man picked out as a companion.' " Accordingly, in the ancient laws, most cities mention parasites among the most honourable of their officers; and, indeed, they do so to this day. And Cleidemus says in his History of Attica - "And then they chose some parasites for Heracles." And Themison, in his Pallenis, says - "That the king, who from time to time fills that office, and the parasites, whom they appoint from the main body of the people, and the old men, and the women who still have their first husbands, shall take care of such and such things."

[27.] G   And from this you perceive, my good friend Ulpianus, that you may raise another question, who the women are who still have their first husbands? But (for we are still speaking about the parasites) there is also an inscription on a pillar in the Anaceium to the following effect - "Of the best bulls which are selected, one-third is to be appropriated to the games; and of the remaining two-thirds, one is to go to the priest, and the other to the parasites." But Crates, in the second book of his treatise on the Attic Dialect, says - "And the word parasite is now used in a disreputable sense; but formerly those people were called parasites who were selected to collect the sacred corn, and there was a regular Hall of the parasites; on which account the following expressions occur in the law of the king - "That the king shall take care of the archons that they are properly appointed, and that they shall select the parasites from the different demes, according to the statutes enacted with reference to that subject. And that the parasites shall, without any evasion or fraud, select from their own share a sixth part of a medimnus of barley, on which all who are citizens of Athens shall feast in the temple, according to the national laws and customs. And that the parasites of the Acharnians shall give a sixth part of a medimnus from their collection of barley to the guild of priests of Apollo. And that there was a regular Hall for the parasites is shown by the following expressions in the same law - "For the repairs of the temple, and of the magistrates' hall, and of the hall of parasites, and of the sacred house, they shall pay whatever sums of money the contractors appointed by the priests think necessary." From this it is evident that the place in which the parasites laid up the first-fruits of the consecrated corn was called the Parasitium, or the Hall of the parasites. And Philochorus gives the same account in his book entitled Tetrapolis [ Fr_73 ], where he mentions the parasites who were elected for the temple of Heracles; and Diodorus of Sinope, a comic poet, in his Heir, (from which I will cite some testimonies presently,) says the same. And Aristotle, in his treatise on the Constitution of Methone, says - "Parasites were two in number for each of the archons, and one for the polemarchs. And they received a fixed allowance from others, and they also took dishes of fish from the fishermen."

[28.] G   But the meaning which is now given to the name parasite is one which Carystius of Pergamum, in his treatise on the Didascaliae, says was first invented by Alexis, forgetting that Epicharmus, in his Hope, or Plutus, has introduced one in a drinking party, where he says - 
  But here another stands at this man's feet, 
  * * * * * 
  Seeking for food which shall not cost him anything, 
  And he will drink up an entire cask, 
  As if it were a cupful.

And he introduces the parasite himself, making the following speech to some one who questioned him - 
  I sup with any one who likes, if he 
  Has only got the good sense to invite me; 
  And with each man who makes a marriage feast, 
  Whether I'm asked or not., there I am witty; 
  [236] There I make others laugh, and there I praise 
  The host, who gives the feast. And if by chance 
  Any one dares to say a word against him, 
  I arm myself for contest, and overwhelm him. 
  Then eating much and drinking plentifully, 
  I leave the house. No lamp-carrier attends me; 
  But I do pick my way with stumbling steps, 
  Both dark and desolate; and if sometimes 
  I do the watchmen meet, I swear to them 
  By all the gods that I have done no wrong; 
  But still they set on me. At last, well beaten, 
  I reach my home, and go to sleep on the ground, 
  And for a while forget my blows and bruises, - 
  While the strong wine retains its sway and lulls me.

[29.] G   And the parasite of Epicharmus makes a second speech of the same kind. And a parasite of Diphilus speaks thus - 
  When a rich man who gives a dinner asks me, 
  I look not at the ceiling or the cornices, 
  Nor do I criticise Corinthian chasings, 
  But keep my eyes fixed on the kitchen smoke, 
  And if it goes up strong and straight to heaven, 
  I joy and triumph, and I flap my wings; 
  But if it be but thin and moving sidewise, 
  Then I perceive my feast too will be thin.

But Homer is the first person, as some say, who introduced the character of a parasite, saying of Podes that he was a beloved guest of Hector [ Il_17'575 ] - 
  There stood a Trojan, not, unknown to fame, 
  Eetion's son, and Podes was his name,- 
  With riches honoured, and with courage blest, 
  By Hector loved, his comrade and his guest.

Alternatively, this is:

For the word ???????? comes to the same thing as ???????, on which account he makes him wounded by Menelaus in the belly, as Demetrius of Scepsis says; as also he represents Pandarus as wounded in the tongue [ Il_5'292 ], because of his having perjured himself; and it is a Spartan who wounds him, one of a nation very much devoted to temperance.

[30.] G   But the ancient poets called parasites flatterers; from whom also Eupolis gave this title to his play, where he represents a chorus of flatterers speaking thus - 
  But we will tell you now 
  The mode of life adopted 
  By the whole flattering band; 
  Listen to us, and learn 
  How well-bred we all are. 
  For first of all a boy, 
  Another person's slave, 
  Attends us; and we are 
  Content with very little. 
  I have two well-made garments, 
  And always have one on; 
  I go to the marketplace, 
  And when I see a man, 
  A foolish man but rich, 
  I make my way to him, 
  And if he says a word 
  I praise his wit and laugh, 
  Delighted at his jests. 
  And then we go to supper, 
  My friends and I, pursuing 
  Each different game so long 
  As we can save our money. 
  And then the parasite 
  Must show his wit and manners, 
  Or out of doors be turned. 
 [237] And one there was, Acestor, 
  A branded slave, if I 
  Am bound to tell the truth, 
  And he was treated so. 
  For not one single joke 
  Did he open his lips to utter, 
  And so the slaves expelled 
  And pilloried the knave, 
  And gave him up to Oeneus.

[31.] G   And Araros, in his Hymenaeus, uses the word parasite, where he says - 
  Why you must be a parasite, my friend; 
  And 'tis Ischomachus who does support you. 

And the word is constantly used among the later writers.

And the verb ?????????, to be a parasite, occurs in Platon the comic writer, in his Lathes. For he says - 
  See how these youths do play the parasite.

And Alexis says that there are two kinds of parasites, in his Pilot, where we find this passage - 
  (A)   There are two kinds of parasites, Nausinicus: 
  The one the common one, much jested on 
  By comic writers, we, the black-faced men 
  (N)   What is the other kind? 
  (A)   Satraps of parasites; 
  Illustrious leaders of the band; a troop 
  Whom you may call the venerable parasites; 
  Men who act well throughout their lives; 
  Knit their brows gravely, win estates and legacies. 
  Do you know the kind of men, and these their manners? 
  (N)   Indeed I do. 
  (A)   Each of these men have one 
  Fixed method of proceeding, flattery; 
  And as in life, fortune makes some men great, 
  And bids the rest content themselves with little; 
  So some of us do thrive, and some do fail. 
  Do I not make the matter plain to you? 
  (N)   Why if I praise you, you will ask for more.

[32.] G   And Timocles, in his Dracontius, hits off the parasite very neatly, and describes his character thus - 
  Shall I then let a man abuse the parasites! 
  No, surely, for there is no race of men 
  More useful in such matters. And if company 
  Be one of the things which makes life pass agreeably, 
  Surely a parasite does this most constantly. 
  Are you in love? he, at the shortest notice, 
  Feels the same passion. Have you any business 
  His business is at once the same as yours; 
  And he's at hand to help you as you wish; 
  Thinking that only fair to him that feeds him. 
  'Tis marvellous how he doth praise his friends - 
  He loves a feast where he is asked for nothing. 
  What man, what hero, or what god exists, 
  Who does not scorn such habits and such principles? 
  But that I mayn't detain you all the day, 
  I think that I can give you one clear proof 
  In what respect men hold a parasite; 
  For they receive the same rewards as those 
  Who at Olympia bear the palm of victory - 
  They both are fed for nothing for their virtues; 
  And wheresoever there is no contribution, 
  That place we ought to call the Prytaneia.

[33.] G   And Antiphanes, in his Twins, says- 
  [238] For look, the parasite, if you judge aright, 
  Shares both the life and fortune of his friends. 
  There is no parasite who'd wish his friends 
  To be unfortunate; but on the contrary 
  His constant prayer will be, that all may prosper. 
  Has any one a fortune? he doesn't envy him; 
  He'd rather always be at hand to share It. 
  He is a genuine friend, and also a safe one, 
  Not quarrelsome, ill-humoured, peevish, sulky, 
  But skilled to keep his temper. Do you mock him? 
  He laughs himself; he's amorous or mirthful, 
  Just as his friend is in the humour. He's a general, 
  Or valiant soldier, only let his pay 
  Be a good dinner, and he'll ask no more.

[34.] G   And Aristophon, in his Physician, says- 
  I wish now to inform him 
  What is my disposition. 
  If any one gives a dinner, 
  I'm always to be found, 
  So that the young men scoffing 
  Because I come in first 
  Do call me gravy soup. 
  Then if there be occasion 
  To check a drunken guest, 
  Or turn him out by force, 
  You'd think me an Argive wrestler; 
  Or must a door be forced? 
  I butt like any ram; 
  Or would you scale a ladder? 
  I'm Capaneus, and eager 
  To climb like him to heaven. 
  Are blows to be endured? 
  A very anvil I; 
  Or Telamon or Ajax, 
  If wounds are to be given; 
  While as a beauty-hunter 
  Even smoke itself can't beat me.

And in his Pythagorean he says - 
  For being hungry, and yet eating nothing, 
  He is a Tithymallus or Philippides; 
  For water-drinking he's a regular frog; 
  For eating thyme and cabbages, a snail; 
  For hating washing he's a pig; for living 
  Out in the open air, a perfect blackbird; 
  For standing cold and chattering all the day, 
  A second grasshopper; in hating oil 
  He's dust; for walking barefoot in the morning, 
  A crane; for passing sleepless nights, a bat.

[35.] G   And Antiphanes says in his Ancestors - 
  You know my ways; 
  That there's no pride in me, but I am just 
  Like this among my friends: a man of iron 
  To bear their blows, a thunderbolt to give them; 
  Lightning to blind a man, the wind to move one; 
  A very halter, if one needs be choked; 
  An earthquake to heave doors from off their hinges; 
  A flea to leap quick in; a fly to come 
  And feast without a formal invitation; 
  Not to depart too soon, a perfect well. 
  I'm ready when I'm wanted, whether it be 
  To choke a man or kill him, or to prove 
  A case against him. All that others say, 
  Those things I am prepared at once to do. 
  And young men, mocking me on this account, 
  Do call me whirlwind - but for me, I care not 
  For such light jests. For to my friends I prove 
  A friend in deeds, and not in words alone.

But Diphilus in his Parasite, when a wedding-feast is about to take place, represents the parasite as speaking thus - 
  Do you not know that in the form of curse 
  These words are found, if any one do fail 
  To point the right road to a traveller, 
  [239] To quench a fire; or if any one spoil 
  The water of a spring or well, or hinders 
  A guest upon his way when going to supper.

And Eubulus says in his Oedipus - 
  The man who first devised the plan of feasting 
  At other folk's expense, must sure have been 
  A gentleman of very popular manners; 
  But he who asked a friend or any stranger 
  To dinner, and then made him bear his share, 
  May he be banished, and his goods all seized.

[36.] G   And Diodorus of Sinope, in his Orphan Heiress, has these expressions, when speaking of a parasite, and they are not devoid of elegance - 
  I wish to show and prove beyond a doubt 
  How reputable, and how usual too, 
  This practice is; a most divine contrivance. 
  Other arts needed not the gods to teach them; 
  Wise men invented them; but Zeus himself 
  Did teach his friends to live as parasites, 
  And he confessedly is king of the gods. 
  For he does often to men's houses come, 
  And cares not whether they be rich or poor; 
  And wheresoever he sees a well-laid couch, 
  And well-spread table near, supplied with all 
  That's good or delicate, he sits him down, 
  And asks himself to dinner, eats and drinks, 
  And then goes home again, and pays no share. 
  And I now do the same. For when I see 
  Couches prepared, and handsome tables loaded, 
  And the door open to receive the guests, 
  I enter in at once, and make no noise, 
  But trim myself, behaving quietly, 
  To give no great annoyance to my neighbour, 
  And then, when I have well enjoyed the whole 
  That's set before me, and when I have drunk 
  Of delicate wines enough, I home return, 
  Like friendly Zeus. And that such a line 
  Was always thought respectable and honest, 
  I now will give you a sufficient proof. 
  This city honours Heracles exceedingly, 
  And sacrifices to him in all the demes, 
  And at these sacred rites it never admits 
  The common men, or parasites, or beggars; 
  But out of all the citizens it picks 
  Twelve men of all the noblest families, 
  All men of property and character; 
  And then some rich men, imitating Heracles, 
  Select some parasites, not choosing those 
  Who are the wittiest men, but who know best 
  How to conciliate men's hearts with flattery; 
  So that if any one should eat a radish, 
  Or stinking shad, they'd take their oaths at once 
  That he had eaten lilies, roses, violets; 
  And that if any odious smell should rise, 
  They'd ask where you did get such fine incense. 
  So that because these men behave so basely, 
  That which was used to be accounted honourable, 
  Is now accounted base.

[37.] G   And Axionicus, in his Chalcidian, says - 
  When first I wished to play the parasite 
  With that Philoxenus, while youth did still 
  Raise down upon my cheeks, I learnt to bear 
  Hard blows from knuckles, and cups and dishes, 
  And bones, so great that oftentimes I was 
  [240] All over wounds; but still it paid me well, 
  For still the pleasure did exceed the pain. 
  And even in some sort I did esteem 
  The whole affair desirable for me. 
  Is a man quarrelsome, and eager too 
  To fight with me? I turn myself to him; 
  And all the blame which he docs heap upon me, 
  I own to be deserved; and am not hurt. 
  Does any wicked man call himself good? 
  I praise that man, and earn his gratitude. 
  Today if I should eat some boiled fish 
  I do not mind eating the rest tomorrow. 
  Such is my nature and my principle.

  But Antidotus, in his play which is entitled Protochorus, introduces a man resembling those who in the Museium of Claudius still practise their sophistries; whom it is not even creditable to remember; and he represents him speaking thus- 
  Stand each one in your place, and listen to me, 
  Before I write my name, and take my cloak. 
  If any question should arise today 
  About those men who live as parasites, 
  I have at all times much esteemed their art, 
  And from my childhood have inclined to learn it.

[38.] G   And among the parasites these men are commemorated by name: Tithymallus, who is mentioned by Alexis in his Milesian Woman, and in his Odysseus the Weaver. And in his Olynthians he says - 
  This is your poor man, O my darling woman; 
  This is the only class, as men do say, 
  Who can put death to flight. Accordingly 
  This Tithymallus does immortal live.

And Dromon in his Psaltria says- 
  (A)   I was above all things ashamed when I 
  Found that I was again to have a supper 
  For which I was to give no contribution. 
  (B)   A shameful thing, indeed. Still you may see 
  Our Tithymallus on his way, more red 
  Than saffron or vermilion; and he blushes, 
  As you may guess, because he nothing pays.

And Timocles, in his Centaur, or Dexamenus, says - 
  Calling him Tithymallus, parasite.

And in his Caunians he says- 
  (A)   Will any other thing appear? Be quick, 
  For Tithymallus has returned to life, 
  Who was quite dead, now that he well has boiled 
  Eight obols' worth of lupin seed. 
  (B)   For he 
  Could not persist in starving himself, but only 
  In drinking wine at other men's expense.

And in his Letters he says - 
  Alas me, how I am in love! ye gods! 
  Not Tithymallus did so long to eat, 
  Nor Cormus ever to steal another's cloak, 
  Nor Neilus to eat cakes, nor Corydus 
  To exercise his teeth at other's cost.

And Antiphanes says in his Etruscan - 
  A. For he will not assist his friends for nothing. 
  B. You say that Tithymallus will be rich, 
  For as I understand you, he will get 
  Sufficient pay, and a collection suitable 
  From those within whose doors he freely sups.

[39.] G   [241]  # Corydus ['Lark'] also was one of the most notorious parasites. And he is mentioned by Timocles, in his The Man who Rejoices at Misfortunes of others, thus - 
  To see a well-stocked market is a treat 
  To a rich man, but torture to a poor one. 
  Accordingly once Corydus, when he 
  Had got no invitation for the day, 
  Went to buy something to take home with him. 
  And who can cease to laugh at what befell him ?- 
  The man had only four-pence in his purse; 
  Gazing on tunnies, eels, crabs, rays, anchovies, 
  He bit his lips till the blood came in vain; 
  Then going round, "How much is this?" said he- 
  Then frightened at the price, he bought red herrings.

And Alexis, in Demetrius, or Philetaerus, says - 
  I fear to look at Corydus in the face, 
  Seeming so glad to dine with any one; 
  But I will not deny it; he's the same, 
  And never yet refused an invitation.

And in his Nurse he says - 
  This Corydus who has so often practised 
  His jokes and witticisms, wishes now 
  To be Blepaeus, and he's not far wrong, 
  For mighty are the riches of Blepaeus.

And Cratinus the younger in his Titans says - 
  Beware of Corydus the wary brass-founder; 
  Unless you make your mind up long before 
  To leave him nothing. And I warn you now 
  Never to eat your fish with such a man 
  As Corydus; for he's a powerful hand, 
  Brazen, unwearied, strong as fire itself.

But that Corydus used to cut jokes, and was fond of being laughed at for them, the same Alexis tells us in his Poets - 
  I have a great desire to raise a laugh, 
  And to say witty things, and gain a fame 
  Second alone to that of Corydus.

And Lynceus the Samian repeats several of his sayings, and asserts that his proper name was Eucrates. And he writes thus concerning him- "Eucrates, who was called Corydus, when he was once feasting with some one whose house was in a very shabby condition, said, 'A man who sups here ought to hold up the house with his left hand like the Caryatides.' "

[40.] G   But Philoxenus, who was surnamed Pternocopis ['Ham-cleaver'], when it happened to be mentioned that thrushes were very dear, and that too while Corydus was present, who was said formerly to have prostituted himself - "I," said he, "can recollect when a lark [???????] only cost an obol." (And Philoxenus too was a parasite, as Axionicus has stated in his Chalcidian. But the statement has already been quoted [ 239'f ].) Menander too mentions him in his Cecryphalus, calling him Pternocopis only. And Machon the comic writer mentions him.- But Machon was either a Corinthian or Sicyonian by birth, living, however, in my own city of Alexandria; and he was the tutor of Aristophanes the grammarian, as far as comedy went. And he died in Alexandria, and an inscription to the following effect is placed upon his tomb - 
  Bring, O light dust, the conqueror's ivy wreath 
  To Machon, who shall live beyond the tomb, 
  Machon the comic poet; for you hold 
  [242] No dirty drone, but you embrace at last 
  A worthy relic of antique renown. 
  These words from the old bard himself might flow, 
  City of Cecrops; even by the Nile 
  Is found at times a plant to all the Muses dear.

And surely this is equivalent to a statement that he was an Alexandrian by birth. However that may be, Machon mentions Corydus in these terms- 
  A messmate once asked Eucrates (Corydus) 
  On what terms he and Ptolemy did stand, 
  I'm sure, said he, I cannot tell myself: 
  For he makes me drink like any doctor; 
  But never gives me solid food to eat.

And Lynceus, in the second book of his treatise on Menander, says the men who got a reputation for saying witty things were Eucleides the son of Smicrinus, and Philoxenus called Pternocopis. And of them Eucleides did at times say clever remarks not unworthy of being written down and recollected; but in all other matters he was cold and disagreeable. But Philoxenus did not particularly excel in short curt sayings, but still whatever he said, whether, in the way of gossip, or of a bitter attack on any of his companions, or of relation of occurrences, was full of pleasant and witty conversation. And yet it happened that Eucleides was not very popular, but that Philoxenus was loved and respected by every one.

[41.] G   But Alexis, in his Trophonius, mentions a certain Moschion, a parasite, calling him "a messmate of every one," and saying - 
  Then comes Moschion, 
  Who bears the name of messmate in the world.

And in his Pancratiast, Alexis, giving a regular catalogue of the dinner hunters, says - 
  (A)   First then there was Callimedon the crab; 
  Then Cobion, and Corydus, and Cyrebion, 
  Scombrus and Semidalis. 
  (B)   Heracles! 
  This is a list of dishes, not of guests.

But Epicrates was nicknamed Cyrebion ['Pod'], and he was the son-in-law of Aeschines the orator, as Demosthenes tells us in the oration about the False Embassy. And Anaxandrides, in his Odysseus, mentions such epithets as these, which the Athenians used to affix to people out of joke; saying - 
  For you are always mocking one another; 
  I know it well. And if a man be handsome 
  You call him Holy Marriage . . . . 
  If a man be a perfect dwarf, a manikin, 
  You call him Drop. Is any one a dandy? 
  He is called Fop; you know an instance. 
  Does a man walk about all fat and heavy, 
  Like Democles? you call him Gravy Soup. 
  Does any one love dirt? his name is Dust. 
  Does any one bedaub his friends with flattery? 
  They call him Dinghy. Does one lack a supper ? 
  He is the Fasting mullet; and if 
  One casts one's eye upon a handsome youth, 
  They dub one the Smoke of Theagenes. 
  Does one in joke convey a lamb away? 
  They call one Atreus: or a ram? then Phrixus: 
  Or if you take a fleece, they name you Jason.

[42.] G   And [Matron] mentions Chaerephon the parasite in the passage before this. [243] But Menander mentions him likewise in the Head-dress: and in his Anger he says - 
  The man does not differ the least from Chaerephon, 
  Whoever he may be. He once was asked to supper 
  At four o'clock, and so he early rose, 
  And measuring the shadow on the dial 
  By the moon's light, he started off and came 
  To eat his supper at the break of day.

And in his Drunkenness he says - 
  That witty fellow Chaerephon delayed me, 
  Saying that he should make a marriage feast 
  The twenty-second of the month, that then 
  He might dine with his friends on the fourth, 
  For that the goddess's affairs were prospering.

And he mentions him also in his Man-woman, or the Cretan. But Timocles in his Letters mentions him especially as having attached himself as a parasite to Demotion, who was an intemperate man - 
  But Demotion was one who spared for nothing, 
  Thinking his money never could run dry, 
  But dinners gave to all who liked to come. 
  And Chaerephon, that wretchedest of men, 
  Treated his house as though it were his own. 
  And yet is not this a most shameful thing, 
  To take a branded slave for a parasite? 
  For he's a perfect clown, and not in want.

And Antiphanes says in his Scythian - 
  Let us go now to sup, just as we are. 
  Bearing our torches and our garlands with us; 
  It was thus that Chaerephon, when supperless, 
  Used to manoeuvre for an invitation.

And Timotheus says in his Puppy - 
  Let us start off to go to dinner now, 
  'Tis one of seven couches as he told me; 
  Though Chaerephon perhaps may add himself.

[43.] G   And Apollodorus the Carystian, in his Priestess, says - 
  They say that Chaerephon all uninvited 
  Came to the wedding feast of Ophelas, 
  Thrusting himself in in unheard-of fashion. 
  For carrying a basket and a garland 
  When it was dark, he said that he had come 
  By order of the bride, bringing some birds, 
  And on this pretext he did get his supper.

And in his Murdered Woman he says - 
  I Ares invoke, and mighty Victory, 
  To favour this my expedition. 
  I also call on Chaerephon - but then 
  He's sure to come, even if I call him not.

And Machon the comic writer says- 
  Once Chaerephon a lengthened journey took 
  Out of the city to a wedding feast, 
  And on his way met Diphilus the poet, 
  Who greeted him- "Take my advice, O Chaerephon, 
  And fasten four stout nails to your two cheeks; 
  Lest, while you shake your head in your long journey, 
  You should put both your jaws quite out of joint.

And in another place he says - 
  Chaerephon once was purchasing some meat, 
  And when the butcher was by chance, he says, 
  Cutting him out a joint with too much bone, 
  He said, O butcher, don't weigh me that bone. 
  Says he, The meat is sweet, indeed men say 
  [244] The meat is always sweetest near the bone. 
  But Chaerephon replied, it may be sweet, 
  But still it weighs much heavier than I like.

And Callimachus attributes to Chaerephon a certain treatise, in the list which he gives, entitled, A Catalogue of all sorts of Things. And he writes thus:- "Those who have written about feasts:- Chaerephon in his Cyrebion;" and then he quotes the first sentence- "Since you have often written to me;" and says that the work consisted of three hundred and seventy-five lines. And that Cyrebion was a parasite has been already mentioned.

[44.] G     # Machon also mentions Archephon the parasite, and says - 
  There was a parasite named Archephon, 
  Who, having sailed from Attica to Egypt, 
  Was asked by Ptolemy the king to supper. 
  Then many kinds of fish which cling to rocks 
  Were served up, genuine crabs, and dainty limpets; 
  And last of all appeared a large round dish 
  With three boiled tench of mighty size, at which 
  The guests all marvelled; and this Archephon 
  Ate of the char, and mackerel, and mullets, 
  Till he could eat no longer; when he never 
  Had tasted anything before more tender 
  Than sprats and minnows from the Phalerum; 
  But from the tench he carefully abstained. 
  And this did seem a most amazing thing, 
  So that the king inquired of Alcenor, 
  Whether the man had overlooked the tench. 
  The hunchback said; No, quite the contrary, 
  He was the first to see them, Ptolemy, 
  But still he will not touch them, for this fish 
  Is one he holds in awe; and he's afraid 
  And thinks it quite against his country's rules 
  That he, while bringing nothing to the feast, 
  Should dare to eat a fish which has a vote.

[45.] G   And Alexis in his Wine-Bibber introduces Stratius the parasite as grumbling at the man who gives him his dinner, and speaking thus - 
  I'd better be a parasite of Pegasus, 
  Or the sons of Boreas, or whoever else 
  Is faster still, than thus to Demeas 
  Eteobutades, the son of Laches, 
  For he is not content to walk, but flies.

And a little afterwards he says - 
  (A)   Oh Stratius, dost thou love me? 
  (B)   Aye, I do 
  More than my father, for he does not feed me; 
  But you do give the best of dinners daily. 
  (A)   And do you pray the gods that I may live? 
  (B)   No doubt I do; for how should I myself 
  Live if misfortune happened unto you?

And Axionicus the comic poet, in his Etruscan, mentions Gryllion the parasite in these words - 
  They cannot now make the excuse of wine, 
  As Gryllion was always used to do.

And Aristodemus, in the second book of his Memoranda of Laughable Things, gives the following list of parasites:- Sostratus the parasite of Antiochus the king, Evagoras the Hunchback, parasite of Demetrius Poliorcetes, and Phormion parasite of Seleucus. [245] And Lynceus the Samian, in his Apophthegms, says- "Silanus the Athenian, when Gryllion the parasite of Menander the satrap was passing by in a superb robe, and accompanied by a great number of attendants, being asked who he was, said, 'He is a jaw worthy of Menander.' But Chaerephon the parasite, coming once to a wedding feast without being invited, and sitting down the last of all, when the gynaeconomi had counted those who were invited, and desired him to depart as having made the number of guests to exceed the legitimate number of thirty, said, 'Count us over again, and begin with me.' "

[46.] G   And that it was a custom for the officers called gynaeconomi to superintend the banquets, and to examine into the number of those who had been invited, and see whether it was in accordance with the law, we may learn from Timocles in his Litigious Man, where he says- 
  Open the doors at once, that we may be 
  More in the light when the gynaeconomus 
  Enters and begins to count the guests, 
  As he is bound to do by this new law, 
  A marvellous statute. It were better far 
  That he should ask who are without a dinner.

And Menander says in his Head-dress - 
  Knowing that by some new law lately passed, 
  The cooks who minister at marriage feasts 
  Have given in their names and are enrolled 
  In the books of the gynaeconomi, 
  So that they may the number learn of those 
  Who are invited, lest a man should feast 
  More than the legal number.

And Philochorus, in the seventh book of his history of the Affairs of Attica [ Fr_65 ], says- The gynaeconomi used, in conjunction with the judges of the Areopagus, to examine the parties in private houses, and at marriage feasts, and at all other festivals and sacrifices.

[47.] G     # And Lynceus records the following sayings of Corydus:- "Once when a courtesan whose name was Gnome ['resolution'] was supping with Corydus, the wine ran short, on which he desired every one to contribute two obols; and said that Gnome should contribute whatever the people thought fit. And once when Polyctor the harp-player was eating lentil porridge, and had got a stone between his teeth, 'O you unhappy man!' said Corydus, 'even a lentil strikes you.' "

And perhaps he is the same person whom Machon mentions; for he says- 
  It seems that once a wretched harp-player, 
  Being about to build himself a house, 
  Begged of a friend to lend him a few stones; 
  And many more will I repay, he said, 
  When I've displayed my art to all the people.

And once, when somebody said to Corydus that he sometimes kissed the neck, and the breasts, and even the navel (???????) of his wife, "That is very wrong," said he; "for even Heracles went from Omphale to Hebe." And when Phyromachus dipped a piece of bread into some lentil porridge, and upset the dish, he said that it was right that he should be fined, because he did not know how to eat properly, though he professed to. And once, at Ptolemy's table, when a rich meat dish was carried round to the guests, but was finished before it came to him- "O Ptolemy," said he, "am I drunk, or am I right in thinking that these dishes are carried round?" And when Chaerephon the parasite said that he was unable to stand much wine, he rejoined, "No, nor stand what [water] is put into the wine either." And once, when at some entertainment Chaerephon rose up from supper quite naked- "O Chaerephon," said he, "you are just like a bottle, so that we can see how nearly full you are." And when Demosthenes received that goblet from Harpalus - [246] "This man," said he, "who calls other men hard drinkers, has himself swallowed a large cup." And, as he was in the habit of bringing dirty loaves to supper, once, when somebody else brought some which were blacker still, he said, "that he had not brought loaves, but the shades of loaves."

[48.] G   And Philoxenus the parasite, who was surnamed Pternocopis, once was dining with Python, and olives (?????) were put on the table, and after a little while a dish of fish was brought; and he, striking the dish, said- He drove them with a lash [???????? ?' ?????]. And once, at supper, when the man who had invited him had set loaves of black bread before him, he said, "Do not give me too many, lest you should darken the room." And Pausimachus said of a certain parasite who was maintained by an old woman, "That the man who lived with the old woman fared in exactly the contrary manner to the old woman herself; for that he was always large." And he is the man of whom Machon writes in this manner: 
  They say that Moschion the water drinker 
  Once, when he was with friends in the Lyceium, 
  Seeing a parasite who was used to live 
  Upon a rich old woman, said to him, 
  "My friend, your fate is truly marvellous: 
  For your old dame does give you a big belly."

And the same man, hearing of a parasite who was maintained by an old woman, and who lived in habits of daily intimacy with her, said - 
  Nothing is strange henceforth, she beings forth nothing, 
  But the man daily doth become big-bellied.

 # And Ptolemaeus, the son of Agesarchus, a native of Megalopolis, in the second book of his history of Philopator, says that men to dine with the king were collected from every city, and that they were called jesters.

[49.] G   And Poseidonius of Apameia, in the twenty-third book of his histories, says [ Fr_17 ], "The Celts, even when they make war, take about with them companions to dine with them, whom they call parasites. And these men celebrate their praises before large companies assembled together, and also to private individuals who are willing to listen to them; they have also a description of people called Bards, who make them music; and these are poets, who recite their praises with songs." And in his thirty-fourth book, the same writer speaks of a man whose name was Apollonius, as having been the parasite of Antiochus surnamed Grypus, king of Syria.   # And Aristodemus relates that Bithys, the parasite of king Lysimachus, once, when Lysimachus threw a wooden figure of a scorpion on his cloak, leaped up in a great fright; but presently, when he perceived the truth, he said, "I, too, will frighten you, O king! - give me a talent." For Lysimachus was very stingy. And Agatharchides of Cnidus, in the twenty-second book of his history of Europe, says that Anthemocritus the pancratiast was the parasite of Aristomachus, the tyrant of the Argives.

[50.] G    And Timocles has spoken in general terms of parasites in his Boxer, when he calls them episitioi, in these words - 
  You will find here some of the parasites 
  Who eat at other men's tables till they burst, 
  That you might say they give themselves to athletes 
  To act as punching bags.

And Pherecrates, in his Old Women, says - 
  (A)   Bet you, my friend Smicythion, will not 
  Get your food quicker. 
  (B)   Who, I pray, is this? 
  (A)   I bring this greedy stranger everywhere 
  As if he were my hired slave or soldier.

For these men are properly called episitioi who do any service for their keep. [247] Plato says, in the fourth book of his treatise on the Republic [ 420'a ], "And the episitioi do these things, who do not, as others do, receive any wages in addition to their food." And Aristophanes says, in his Storks - 
  For if you prosecute one wicked man, 
  Twelve episitioi will come against you, 
  And so defeat you by their evidence.

And Eubulus says, in his Daedalus - 
  He wishes to remain an episitios 
  Among them, and will never ask for wages.

[51.] G   And Diphilus, in his Synoris (and Synoris is the name of a courtesan) mentioning Euripides (and Euripides is the name given to a particular throw on the dice), and punning on the name of the poet, says this at the same time about parasites :- 
  (A)   You have escaped well from such a throw. 
  (B)   You are right witty. 
  (A)   Well, lay down your drachma. 
  (B)   That has been done: how shall I throw Euripides? 
  (A)   Euripides will never save a woman. 
  See you not how he hates them in his tragedies? 
  But he has always fancied parasites, 
  And thus he speaks, you'll easily find the place: 
  "For every rich man who does not feed 
  At least three men who give no contribution, 
  Exile deserves and everlasting ruin." 
  (B)   Where is that passage? 
  (A)   What is that to you? 
  'Tis not the play, but the intent that signifies.

And in the amended edition of the same play, speaking of a parasite in a passion, he says - 
  Is then the parasite angry? is he furious? 
  Not he: he only smears with gall the table. 
  And weans himself like any child from milk.

And immediately afterwards he adds- 
  (A)   Then you may eat, O parasite. 
  (B)   Just see 
  How he disparages that useful skill. 
  (A)   Well, know you not that all men rank a parasite 
  Below a harp-player!

And in the play, which is entitled The Parasite, he says - 
  A surly man should never be a parasite.

[52.] G   And Menander, in his Passion, speaking of a friend who had refused an invitation to a marriage feast, says - 
  This to be a real friend: not one 
  Who asks, What time is dinner? as the rest do. 
  And, Why should we not all at once sit down? 
  And fishes for another invitation 
  To-morrow and next day, and then again 
  Asks if there's not a funeral feast to follow.

And Alexis in his Orestes, Nicostratus in his Plutus, Menander in his Drunkenness, and in his Lawgiver, speak in the same way; and Philonides, in his Buskins, says - 
  I being abstinent cannot endure 
  Such things as these.

But there are many other kindred nouns to the noun ?????????: there is ????????, which has already been mentioned; and ?????????, and ??????????, and ?????????; and besides these, there is ????????? and ??????????: and Anaxandrides uses the word ????????? in his Huntsmen - 
  A son who feeds at home (?????????) is a great comfort.

And a man is called ????????? who serves the city, not for hire, but gratis. Antiphanes, in his Scythian, says- 
  The ????????? quickly doth become 
  A regular attendant at the assembly.

And Menander says, in his Ring - 
  We found a bridegroom willing to keep house (?????????) 
  At his own charge, for no dowry seeking.

And in his Harp-player he says - 
  You do not get your hearers there for nothing (??????????).

Crates uses the word ????????? in his Deeds of Daring, saying - 
  He feeds his messmate (?????????) while he shivers thus 
  In Megabyzus' house, and he will have 
  Food for his wages.

[248] And he also uses the word in a peculiar sense in his Women dining together, where he says - 
  It is a well-bred custom not to assemble 
  A crowd of women, or to feast a multitude; 
  But to make a domestic (??????????) wedding feast.

And the word ?????????? is used by Alexis, in his Woman sitting up all Night, or the Weavers - 
  You will be but a walking bread-devourer (??????????)

And Menander calls a man who is useless, and who lives to no purpose, ??????????, in his Thrasyleon, saying - 
  A lazy over-procrastinating fellow, 
  A ??????????, miserable, useless, 
  Owning himself a burden on the earth.

And in his Venal People he says - 
  Wretch, you were standing at the door the while, 
  Having laid down your burden; while, for us, 
  We took the wretched ?????????? in.

And Crobylus used the word ????????? (bringing one's own provisions), in The Man hanged - 
  A parasite ?????????, feeding himself, 
  You do contribute much to aid your master.

And Eubulus has the word ????????? (eating badly, having no appetite), in his Ganymedes - 
  Sleep nourishes him since he's no appetite (?????????).

And the word ?????????? (a sparing eater) occurs in Phrynichus in his The solitary Man - 
  What does that sparing eater (??????????) Heracles there?

And Pherecrates, or Strattis, in his Good Men - 
  How sparingly you eat, who in one day 
  Swallow the food of an entire trireme.

[53.] G   [248] When Plutarchus had said all this about parasites, Democritus, taking up the discourse, said, And I myself, 'like wood well-glued to wood,' as the Theban poet has it, will say a word about flatterers. 
  For of all men the flatterer fares best, 
as the excellent Menander says. And there is no great difference between calling a man a flatterer and a parasite. Accordingly, Lynceus the Samian, in his Commentaries, gives the name of parasite to Cleisophus, the man who is universally described as the flatterer of Philippus, the king of the Macedonians (but he was an Athenian by birth, as Satyrus the Peripatetic affirms, in his Life of Philippus). And Lynceus says - "Cleisophus, the parasite of Philippus, when Philippus rebuked him for being continually asking for something, replied, 'I am very forgetful.' Afterwards, when Philippus had given him a wounded horse, he sold him; and when, after a time, the king asked him what had become of him, he answered, 'He was sold by that wound of his.' And when Philippus laughed at him, and took it good-humouredly, he said, 'Is it not then worth my while to keep you?'" And Hegesander the Delphian, in his Commentaries, makes this mention of Cleisophus:- "When Philippus the king said that writings had been brought to him from Cotys, king of Thrace, Cleisophus, who was present, said, 'It is well, by the gods.' And when Philippus said, 'But what do you know of the subjects mentioned in these writings?' he said, 'By the great Zeus, you have reproved me with admirable judgement.'"

[54.] G   But Satyrus, in his Life of Philippus, says, "When Philippus lost his eye, Cleisophus came forth with him, with bandages on the same eye as the king; and again, when his leg was hurt, he came out limping, along with the king. And if ever Philippus ate any harsh or sour food, [249] he would contract his features, as if he, too, had the same taste in his mouth. But in the country of the Arabs they used to do these things, not out of flattery, but in obedience to some law; so that whenever the king had anything the matter with any one of his limbs, the courtiers pretended to be suffering the same inconvenience: for they think it ridiculous to be willing to be buried with him when be dies, but not to pay him the compliment of appearing to be subject to the same sufferings as he is while alive, if he sustains any injury."  # But Nicolaus of Damascus,- and he was one of the Peripatetic school,- in his very voluminous history (for it consisted of a hundred and forty-four books), in the hundred and eleventh book says, that Adiatomus the king of the Sotiani (and that is a Celtic tribe) had six hundred picked men about him, who were called by the Gauls, in their national language, Siloduri - which word means in Greek, Bound under a vow. "And the king has them as companions, to live with him and to die with him; as that is the vow which they all take. In return for which, they also share his power, and wear the same dress, and cut the same food; and they die when he dies, as a matter of absolute necessity, if the king dies of any disease; or if he dies in war, or in any other manner. And no one can even say that any of them has shown any fear of death, or has in the least sought to evade it when the king is dead."

[55.] G   But Theopompus says, in the forty-fourth book of his Histories, that Philippus appointed Thrasydaeus the Thessalian tyrant over all those of his nation, though a man who had but little intellect, but who was an egregious flatterer. But Arcadion the Achaean was not a flatterer, who is mentioned by the same Theopompus, and also by Duris in the fifth book of his History of Macedonian Affairs. Now this Arcadion hated Philippus, and on account of this hatred voluntarily banished himself from his country. And he was a man of the most admirable natural abilities, and numbers of clever sayings of his are related. It happened then once, when Philippus was sojourning at Delphi, that Arcadion also was there; and the Macedonian beheld him and called him to him, and said, How much further, O Arcadion, do you mean to go by way of banishment? And he replied - 
  Until I meet with men who know not Philippus. [ Hom:Od_11'122 ]

But Phylarchus, in the twenty-first book of his History [ Fr_37 ], says that Philippus laughed at this, and invited Arcadion to supper, and that in that way he got rid of his enmity. But of Nicesias the flatterer of Alexander, Hegesander gives the following account:- "When Alexander complained of being bitten by the flies and was eagerly brushing them off, a man of the name of Nicesias, one of his flatterers who happened to be present, said,- Beyond all doubt those flies will be far superior to all other flies, now that they have tasted your blood." And the same man says that Cheirisophus also, the flatterer of Dionysius, when he saw Dionysius laughing with some of his acquaintances, (but he was some way off himself, so that he could not hear what they were laughing at,) laughed also. And when Dionysius asked him on what account he, who could not possibly hear what was said, laughed, said - I feel that confidence in you that I am quite sure that, what has been said is worth laughing at.

[56.] G   His son also, the second Dionysius, had numerous flatterers, who were called by the common people Dionysiocolaces. And they, because Dionysius himself was not very sharp sighted, used to pretend while at supper not to be able to see very far, but they would touch whatever was near them as if they could not see it, until Dionysius himself guided their hands to the dishes. And when Dionysius spat, they would often put out their own faces for him to spit upon: [250] and then licking off the spittle and even his vomit, they declared that it was sweeter than honey. And Timaeus, in the twenty-second book of his Histories, says that Democles the flatterer of the younger Dionysius, as it was customary in Sicily to make a sacrifice from house to house in honour of the nymphs, and for men to spend the night around their statues when quite drunk, and to dance around the goddesses - Democles neglecting the nymphs, and saying that there was no use in attending to lifeless deities, went and danced before Dionysius. And at a subsequent time being once sent on an embassy with some colleagues to Dion, when they were all proceeding in a trireme, he being accused by the rest of behaving in a seditious manner in respect of this journey, and of having injured the general interests of Dionysius, when Dionysius was very indignant, he said that differences had arisen between himself and his colleagues, because after supper they took a paean of Phrynichus or Stesichorus, and some of them took one of Pindarus' and sang it; but he, with those who agreed with him, went entirely through the hymns which had been composed by Dionysius himself. And he undertook to bring forward undeniable proof of this assertion. For that his accusers were not acquainted with the modulation of those songs, but that he on the contrary was ready to sing them all through one after the other. And so, when Dionysius was pacified, Democles continued, and said, "But you would do me a great favour, O Dionysius, if you were to order any one of those who knows it to teach me the paean which you composed in honour of Asclepius; for I hear that you have taken great pains with that."

And once, when some friends were invited to supper by Dionysius, Dionysius coming into the room, said, "O, my friends, letters have been sent to us from the generals who have been despatched to Neapolis;" and Democles interrupting him, said, "By the gods, they have done well, O Dionysius." And he, looking upon him, said, "But how do you know whether what they have written is in accordance with my expectation or the contrary?" And Democles replied, "By the gods, you have properly rebuked me, O Dionysius." Timaeus also affirms that there was a man named Satyrus who was a flatterer of both the Dionysii.

[57.] G     # And Hegesander relates that Hieron the tyrant was also rather weak in his eyes; and that his friends who supped with him made mistakes in the dishes on purpose, in order to let him set them right, and to give him an opportunity of appearing clearer-sighted than the rest. And Hegesander says that Eucelides, who was surnamed Seutlus, (and he too was a parasite,) once when a great quantity of sow-thistles (??????) was set before him at a banquet, said, "Capaneus who is introduced by Euripides in his Suppliant Women [ 864 ], was a very witty man - 
  Detesting tables where there was too much pride (?????).

 # But those who were the leaders of the people at Athens, says he, in the Chremonidean war, flattered the Athenians, and said, "that everything else was common to all the Greeks; but that the Athenians were the only men who knew the road which leads to heaven." And Satyrus, in his Lives, says that Anaxarchus, the Eudaemonist philosopher, was one of the flatterers of Alexander; and that he once, when on a journey in company with the king, when a violent and terrible thunderstorm took place, so as to frighten everybody, said - "Was it you, O Alexander, son of Zeus, who caused this?" [251] And that he laughed and said - "Not I; for I do not wish to be formidable, as you make me out; you also desire me to have brought to me at supper the heads of satraps and kings." And Aristobulus of Cassandreia says that Dioxippus the Athenian, a pancratiast, once when Alexander was wounded and when the blood flowed, said [ Hom:Il_5'340 ]- 
  'Tis ichor, such as flows from the blessed gods.

[58.] G   And Epicrates the Athenian, having gone on an embassy to the [Persian] king, according to the statement of Hegesander, and having received many presents from him, was not ashamed to flatter the king openly and boldly, so as even to say that the best way was not to choose nine archons every year, but nine ambassadors to the king. But I wonder at the Athenians, how they allowed him to make such a speech without bringing him to trial, and yet fined Demades ten talents, because he thought Alexander a god; and they put Evagoras to death, because when he went as ambassador to the king he prostrated himself before him. And Timon of Phlius, in the third book of his Silli, says that Ariston the Chian, an acquaintance and pupil of Zenon of Citium, was a flatterer of Persaeus the philosopher, because he was a companion of Antigonus the king. But Phylarchus, in the sixth book of his Histories [ Fr_11 ], says that Nicesias the flatterer of Alexander, when he saw the king in convulsions from some medicine which he had taken, said - "O king, what must we do, when even you gods suffer in this manner?" and that Alexander, scarcely looking up, said - "What sort of gods? I am afraid rather we are hated by the gods." And in his twenty-eighth book the same Phylarchus says [ Fr_46 ] that Apollophanes was a flatterer of Antigonus who was surnamed Epitropus ['Guardian'], who took Lacedaemon, and he used to say that the fortune of Antigonus Alexandrized.

[59.] G   But Euphantus, in the fourth book of his Histories, says that Callicrates was a flatterer of Ptolemy, the third king of Egypt, and was so clever that he not only bore an image of Odysseus on his seal, but that he also gave his children the names of Telegonus and Anticleia.   # And Polybius, in the thirteenth book of his Histories [ 13.4 ], says that Heracleides of Tarentum was a flatterer of the Philippus whose power was destroyed by the Romans; and that it was he who overturned his whole kingdom. And in his fourteenth book [ 14.11 ], he says that Philon was a flatterer of Agathocles the son of Oenanthe, and the companion of the king Ptolemy Philopator. And Baton of Sinope relates, in his book about the tyranny of Hieronymus, that Thrason, who was surnamed Carcharus, was the flatterer of Hieronymus the tyrant of Syracuse, saying that he every day used to drink a great quantity of unmixed wine. But another flatterer, by name Osis, caused Thrason to be put to death by Hieronymus; and he persuaded Hieronymus himself to assume the diadem, and the purple and all the rest of the royal apparel, which Dionysius the tyrant was accustomed to wear. And Agatharchides, in the thirtieth book of his Histories, says - "Haeresippus the Spartan was a great rascal, not even putting on any appearance of goodness; but having very persuasive flattering language, and being a very clever man at paying court to the rich as long as their fortune lasted." [252] Such also was Heracleides of Maroneia, the flatterer of Seuthes the king of the Thracians, who is mentioned by Xenophon in the seventh book of the Anabasis [ 7.3'16 ].

[60.] G   But Theopompus, in the eighteenth book of his Histories, speaking of Nicostratus the Argive, and saying how he flattered the Persian king, writes as follows - "But how can we think Nicostratus the Argive anything but a wicked man? who, when he was president of the city of Argos, and when he had received all the distinctions of family, and riches, and large estates from his ancestors, surpassed all men in his flatteries and attentions to the king, outrunning not only those who bore a part in that expedition, but even all who had lived before; for in the first place, he was so anxious for honours from the barbarian, that, wishing to please him more and to be more trusted by him, he brought his son to the king, a thing which no one else will ever be found to have done. And then, every day when he was about to go to supper he had a table set apart, to which he gave the name of the Table of the King's Deity, loading it with meat and all other requisites; hearing that those who live at the doors of the royal palace among the Persians do the same thing, and thinking that by this courtier-like attention he should get more from the king. For he was exceedingly covetous, and not scrupulous as to the means he employed for getting money, so that indeed no one was over less so." And Lysimachus was a flatterer and the tutor of Attalus the king, a man whom Callimachus sets down as a pupil of Theodorus, but Hermippus sets him down in the list of the disciples of Theophrastus. And this man wrote books also about the education of Attalus, full of every kind of adulation imaginable. But Polybius, in the eighth book of his Histories [ 8.22 ], says, "Cavarus the Gaul, who was in other respects a good man, was depraved by Sostratus the flatterer, who was a native of Chalcedon."

[61.] G   Nicolaus, in the hundred and fourteenth book of his Histories, says that Andromachus of Carrhae was a flatterer of Licinius Crassus, who commanded the expedition against the Parthians; and that Crassus communicated all his designs to him, and was, in consequence, betrayed to the Parthians by him, and so destroyed. But Andromachus was not allowed by the deity to escape unpunished. For having obtained, as the reward of his conduct, the sovereignty over his native place Carrhae, he behaved with such cruelty and violence that he was burnt with his whole family by the inhabitants of Carrhae. And Poseidonius of Apameia, who was afterwards surnamed Rhodian, in the fourth book of his Histories [ Fr_4 ], says that Hierax of Antioch, who used formerly to accompany the singers called Lysiodi on the flute, afterwards became a terrible flatterer of Ptolemy, seventh king of Egypt of that name, who was also surnamed Euergetes; and that he had the very greatest influence over him, as also he had with Ptolemy Philometor, though he was afterwards put to death by him. And Nicolaus the Peripatetic states that Sosipater, who was by trade a juggler, was a flatterer of Mithridates. And Theopompus, in the ninth book of his History of Greek Affairs, says that Athenaeus the Eretrian was a flatterer and servant of Sisyphus the tyrant of Pharsalus.

[62.] G    # The whole populace of the Athenians, too, was very notorious for the height to which it pushed its flattery; accordingly, Demochares the cousin of Demosthenes the orator, in the twentieth book of his histories, speaking of the flattery practised by the Athenians towards Demetrius Poliorcetes, [253] and saying that he himself did not at all like it, writes as follows- "And some of these things annoyed him greatly, as they well might. And, indeed, other parts of their conduct were utterly mean and disgraceful. They consecrated temples to Leaena Aphrodite and Lamia Aphrodite, and they erected altars and shrines as if to heroes, and instituted libations in honour of Burichus, and Adeimantus, and Oxythemis, his flatterers. And poems were sung in honour of all these people, so that even Demetrius himself was astonished at what they did, and said that in his time there was not one Athenian of a great or vigorous mind." The Thebans also flattered Demetrius, as Polemon relates in the treatise on the Ornamented Portico at Sicyon; and they, too, erected a temple to Lamia Aphrodite. But she was one of Demetrius' mistresses, as also was Leaena. So that why should we wonder at the Athenians, who stooped even to become flatterers of flatterers, singing paeans and hymns to Demetrius himself?

Accordingly Demochares, in the twenty-first book of his Histories, says- "And the Athenians received Demetrius when he came from Leucas and Corcyra to Athens, not only with frankincense, and crowns, and libations of wine, but they even went out to meet him with hymns, and choruses, and ithyphallic mummers, and dancing and singing, and they stood in front of him in multitudes, dancing and singing, and saying that he was the only true god, and that all the rest of the gods were either asleep, or gone away to a distance, or were no gods at all. And they called him the son of Poseidon and Aphrodite, for he was eminent for beauty, and affable to all men with a natural courtesy and gentleness of manner. And they fell at his feet and addressed supplications and prayers to him."

[63.] G   Demochares, then, has said all this about the adulatory spirit and conduct of the Athenians. And Duris the Samian, in the twenty-second book of his Histories, has given the very ithyphallic hymn which they addressed to him - 
  Behold the greatest of the gods and dearest 
  Are come to this city, 
  For here Demeter and Demetrius are 
  Present in season. 
  She indeed comes to duly celebrate 
  The sacred mysteries 
  Of her most holy daughter - he is present 
  Joyful and beautiful, 
  As a god ought to be, with smiling face 
  Showering his blessings round. 
  How noble does he look! his friends around, 
  Himself the centre. 
  His friends resemble the bright lesser stars, 
  Himself is the sun. 
  Hail, ever-mighty Poseidon's mightier son; 
  Hail, son of Aphrodite. 
  For other gods do at a distance keep, 
  Or have no ears, 
  Or no existence; and they heed not us - 
  But you are present, 
  Not made of wood or stone, a genuine god. 
  We pray to you. 
  First of all give us peace, O dearest god - 
  For you are lord of peace - 
  And crush for us yourself, for you've the power, 
  This odious Sphinx; 
  Which now destroys not Thebes alone, but Greece - 
  The whole of Greece - 
  I mean the Aetolian, who, like her of old, 
  Sits on a rock, 
  And tears and crushes all our wretched bodies. 
  Nor can we him resist. 
  For the Aetolians plunder all their neighbours; 
  And now they stretch afar 
  Their lion hands; but crush them, mighty lord, 
  Or send some Oedipus 
  Who shall this Sphinx hurl down from off his precipice, 
  Or starve him justly.

[64.] G   This is what was sung by the nation which once fought at Marathon, and they sang it not only in public, but in their private houses - men who had once put a man to death for prostrating himself before the king of Persia, and who had slain countless myriads of barbarians. [254] Therefore, Alexis, in his Apothecary, or Crateuas, introduces a person pledging one of the guests in a cup of wine, and represents him as saying - 
  Boy, give a larger cup, and pour therein 
  Four cyathi of strong and friendly drink, 
  In honour of all present. Then you shall add 
  Three more for love; one for the victory, 
  The glorious victory of King Antigonus, 
  Another for the young Demetrius. 
  * * * * *

And presently he adds - 
  Bring a third cup in honour now 
  Of Phila Aphrodite. Hail, my friends and guests; 
  I drink the cup to the success of all of you.

[65.] G   Such were the Athenians, at that time, after flattery, that worst of wild beasts, had inspired their city with frenzy, that city which once the Pythia entitled the Hearth of Greece, and which Theopompus, who hated them, called the prytaneium of Greece; he who said in other places that Athens was fall of drunken flatterers, and sailors, and pickpockets, and also of false witnesses, sycophants, and false accusers. And it is my opinion that it was they who introduced all the flattery which we have been speaking of, like a storm, or other infliction, sent on men by the gods; concerning which Diogenes said, very elegantly- "That it was much better to go ?? ??????? ['to the crows'] than ?? ??????? ['to the flatterers'], who eat up all the good men while they are still alive;" and, accordingly, Anaxilas says, in his Young Woman - 
  The flatterers are worms which prey upon 
  All who have money; for they make an entrance 
  Into the heart of a good guileless man. 
  And take their seat there, and devour it. 
  Till they have drained it like the husk of wheat, 
  And leave the shell; and then attack some other.

And Plato says, in his Phaedrus [ 240'b ] - "Nature has mingled some pleasure which is not entirely inelegant in its character of a flatterer, though he is an odious beast, and a great injury to a state." And Theophrastus, in his treatise on Flattery, says that Myrtis the priest, the Argive, taking by the ear Cleonymus (who was a dancer and also a flatterer, and who often used to come and sit by him and his fellow-judges, and who was anxious to be seen in company with those who were thought of consideration in the city), and dragging him out of the assembly, said to him in the hearing of many people, You shall not dance here, and you shall not hear us. And Diphilus, in his Marriage, says - 
  A flatterer destroys 
  By his pernicious speeches 
  Both general and prince, 
  Both private friends and states; 
  He pleases for a while, 
  But causes lasting ruin. 
  And now this evil habit 
  Has spread among the people, 
  Our courts are all diseased, 
  And all is done by favour.

So that the Thessalians did well who razed the city which was called Colaceia (Flattery), which the Melians used to inhabit, as Theopompus relates in the thirtieth book of his History.

[66.] G    # But Phylarchus says [ Fr_29 ], that those Athenians who settled in Lemnos were great flatterers, mentioning them as such in the thirteenth book of his History. For that they, wishing to display their gratitude to the descendants of Seleucus and Antiochus, [255] because Seleucus not only delivered them when they were severely oppressed by Lysimachus but also restored both their cities to them,- they, I say, the Athenians in Lemnos, not only erected temples to Seleucus, but also to his son Antiochus; and they have named the cup, which at their feasts is offered at the end of the banquet, the cup of Seleucus the Saviour.

Now some people, perverting the proper name, call this flattery ????????, complaisance; as Anaxandrides does in his Samian, where he says - 
  For flattery is now complaisance called.

But those who devote themselves to flattery are not aware that that art is one which flourishes only a short time. Accordingly, Alexis says in his Liar - 
  A flatterer's life but a brief space endures, 
  For no one likes a hoary parasite.

And Clearchus of Soli, in the first book of his Amatory treatises, says- "No flatterer is constant in his friendship. For time destroys the falsehood of his pretences, and a lover is only a flatterer and a pretended friend on account of youth or beauty." One of the flatterers of Demetrius the king was Adeimantus of Lampsacus, who having built a temple at Thria, and placed statues in it, called it the temple of Phila Aphrodite, and called the place itself Philaeum, from Phila the (?) wife of Demetrius; as we are told by Dionysius the son of Tryphon, in the tenth book of his treatise on Names.

[67.] G   But Clearchus of Soli, in his book which is inscribed Gergithius, tells us whence the origin of the name flatterer is derived and mentioning Gergithius himself, from whom the treatise has its name, he says that he was one of Alexander's flatterers; and he tells the story thus- "That flattery debases the characters of the flatterers, making them apt to despise whoever they associate with; and a proof of this is, that they endure everything, well knowing what they dare do. And those who are flattered by them, being puffed up by their adulation, they make foolish and empty-headed, and cause them to believe that they, and everything belonging to them, are of a higher order than other people." And then proceeding to mention a certain young man, a Paphian by birth, but a king by the caprice of fortune, he says- "This young man (and he does not mention his name) used out of his preposterous luxury to lie on a couch with silver feet, with a smooth Sardian carpet spread under it of the most expensive description. And over him was thrown a piece of purple cloth, edged with a scarlet fringe; and he had three pillows under his head made of the finest linen, and of purple colour, by which he kept himself cool. And under his feet he had two pillows of the kind called Dorian, of a bright crimson colour; and on all this he lay himself, clad in a white robe.

[68.] G   "And all the monarchs who have at any time reigned in Cyprus have encouraged a race of nobly-born flatterers as useful to them; for they are a possession very appropriate to tyrants. And no one ever knows them (any more than they do the judges of the Areopagus), either how many they are, or who they are, except that perhaps some of the most eminent may be known or suspected. And the flatterers at Salamis are divided into two classes with reference to their families; and it is from the flatterers in Salamis that all the rest of the flatterers in the other parts of Cyprus are derived; and one of these two classes is called the Gergini, and the other the Promalanges. [256] Of which, the Gergini mingle with the people in the city and go about as eavesdroppers and spies in the workshops and the market-places; and whatever they hear, they report every day to those who are called their Principles. But the Promalanges, being a sort of superior investigators, inquire more particularly into all that is reported by the Gergini which appears worthy of being investigated; and the way in which they conduct themselves towards every one is so artificial and gentle, that, as it seems to me, and as they themselves allege, the very seed of notable flatterers has been spread by them over all the places at a distance. They take much pride in their skill, because they are greatly honoured by the kings; and they say that one of the Gergini, being a descendant of those Trojans whom Teucer took as slaves, having selected them from the captives, and then brought and settled in Cyprus, going along the sea coast with a few companions, sailed towards Aeolis, in order to seek out and re-establish the country of his ancestors; and that he, taking some Mysians to himself, inhabited a city near the Trojan Ida, which was formerly called Gergina, from the name of the inhabitants, but is now called Gergitha. For some of the party being, as it seems, separated from this expedition, stopped in Cumae, being by birth a Cyprian race, and not from the Thessalian Tricca, as some have affirmed, - men whose ignorance I take to be beyond the skill of all the descendants of Asclepius to cure.

[69.] G   "There were also in this country, in the time of Glus the Carian, women attaching themselves to the Queens, who were called flatterers; and a few of them who were left crossed the sea, and were sent for to the wives of Artabazus and Mentor, and instead of ????????? ['flatterers'] were called ?????????? from the following circumstance. By way of making themselves agreeable to those who had sent for them, they made a ladder [????????] of themselves, in such a manner that there was a way of ascending over their backs, and also a way of descending, for their mistresses when they drove out in chariots: to such a pitch of luxury, not to say of miserable helplessness, did they bring those silly women by their contrivance. Therefore, they themselves, when they were compelled by fortune to quit that very luxurious way of living, lived with great hardship in their old age. And the others who had received these habits from us, when they were deprived of their authority came to Macedonia; and the customs which they taught to the wives and princesses of the great men in that country by their association with them, it is not decent even to mention further than this, that practising magic arts themselves, and being the objects of them when practised by others, they did not spare even the places of the greatest resort, but they became complete vagabonds, and the very scum of the streets, polluted with all sorts of abominations. Such and so great are the evils which seen to be engendered by flattery in the case of all people who admit from their own inclination and predisposition to be flattered."

[70.] G   And a little further Clearchus goes on as follows- "But still a man may have a right to find fault with that young man for the way in which he used those things, as I have said before. For his slaves stood in short tunics a little behind the couch: and as there are now three men on whose account all this discussion has been originated, and as all these men are men who have separate names among us, the one sat on the couch close to his feet, letting the feet of the young man rest upon his knees, and covering them with a thin cloth; [257] and what he did further is plain enough, even if I do not mention it. And this servant is called by the natives Parabystus ['stuffed in'], because he works his way into the company of those men even who do not willingly receive him, by the very skilful character of his flatteries. The second was one sitting on a certain chair which was placed close to the couch; and he, holding by the hand of the young man, as he let it almost drop and clinging to it, kept on rubbing it, and taking each of his fingers in turn be rubbed it and stretched it, so that the man appeared to have said a very witty thing who first gave that officer the name of Sicya ['cucumber'].  The third, however, was the most noble of all, and was called Ther ['the wild beast'], who was indeed the principal of the whole body, and who stood at his master's head, and shared his linen pillows, lying upon them in a most friendly manner. And with his left hand be kept smoothing the hair of the young man, and with his right hand he kept moving up and down a Phocaean fan, so as to please him while waving it, without force enough to brush anything away. On which account, it appears to me, that some high-born god must have been angry with him and have sent a fly to attack the young man, a fly like that with whose audacity Homer says [ Il_17'570 ] that Athene inspired Menelaus, so vigorous and fearless was it in disposition.

"So when the young man was stung, this man uttered such a loud scream in his behalf and was so indignant, that on account of his hatred to one fly he banished the whole tribe of flies from his house: from which it is quite plain that he appointed this servant for this especial purpose."

[71.] G   But Leucon, the tyrant of Pontus, was a different kind of man, who when he knew that many of his friends had been plundered by one of the flatterers whom he had about him, perceiving that the man was calumniating some one of his remaining friends, said, "I swear by the gods that I would kill you if a tyrannical government did not stand in need of bad men." And Antiphanes the comic writer, in his Soldier, gives a similar account of the luxury of the kings in Cyprus. And he represents one of them as asking a soldier these questions - 
  (A)   Tell me now, you had lived some time in Cyprus? 
  Say you not so? 
  (B)   Yes, all the time of the war. 
  (A)   In what part most especially? tell me that. 
  (B)   In Paphos, where you should have seen the luxury 
  That did exist, or you could not believe it. 
  (A)   What kind of luxury? 
  (B)   The king was fanned 
  While at his supper by young turtle-doves 
  And by nought else. 
  (A)   How mean you? never mind 
  My own affairs, but let me ask you this. 
  (B)   He was anointed with a luscious ointment 
  Brought up from Syria, made of some rich fruit 
  Which they do say doves love to feed upon. 
  They were attracted by the scent and flew 
  Around the royal temples: and had dared 
  To seat themselves upon the monarch's head, 
  But that the boys who sat around with sticks 
  Did keep them at a slight and easy distance. 
  And so they did not perch, but hovered round, 
  Neither too far nor yet too near, still fluttering, 
  So that they raised a gentle breeze to blow 
  Not harshly on the forehead of the king.

[72.] G   [258] The flatterer (?????) of that young man whom we have been speaking of must have been a ??????????? (a soft flatterer), as Clearchus says. For besides flattering such a man as that, he invents a regular gait and dress harmonizing with that of those who receive the flattery, folding his arms and wrapping himself up in a small cloak; on which account some men call him Arm-crosser, and some call him a Repository of Attitudes. For really a flatterer does seem to be the very same person with Proteus himself. Accordingly he changes into nearly every sort of person, not only in form, but also in his discourse, so very varied in voice he is.

But Androcydes the physician said that flattery had its name (????????) from becoming glued (??? ??? ?????????????) to men's acquaintance. But it appears to me that they were named from their facility (???????); because a flatterer will undergo anything, like a person who stoops down to carry another on his back, by reason of his natural disposition, not being annoyed at anything, however disgraceful it may be.

And a man will not be much out who calls the life of that young Cyprian a wet one. And Alexis says that there were many tutors and teachers of that kind of life at Athens, speaking thus in his Pyraunus - 
  I wished to try another style of life, 
  Which all men are accustomed to call wet. 
  So walking three days in the Cerameicus, 
  I found it maybe thirty skilful teachers 
  Of the aforesaid life, from one single school.

And Crobylus says in his Female Deserter - 
  The wetness of your life amazes me, 
  For men do call Intemperance now wetness.

[73.] G   And Antiphanes, in his Lemnian Women, lays it down that flattery is a kind of art, where he says - 
  Is there, or can there be an art more pleasing, 
  Or any source of gain more sure and gainful, 
  Than well-judged flattery? Why does the painter 
  Take so much pains and get so out of temper? 
  Why does the farmer undergo such risks? 
  Indeed all men are full of care and trouble. 
  But life for us is full of fun and laughter. 
  For where the greatest business is amusement, 
  To laugh and joke and drink full cups of wine, 
  Is not that pleasant? How can one deny? 
  'Tis the next thing to being rich oneself.

But Menander, in his play called The Flatterer, has given us the character of one as carefully and faithfully as it is possible to manage it: as also Diphilus has of a parasite in his Telesias. And Alexis, in his Liar, has introduced a flatterer speaking in the following manner- 
  By the Olympian Zeus and by Athene 
  I am a happy man. And not alone 
  Because I'm going to a wedding dinner, 
  But because I shall burst, if it please god. 
  And would that I might meet with such a death.

And it seems to me, my friends, that that fine epicure would not have scrupled to quote from the Omphale of Ion the tragedian, and to say - 
  For I must speak of a yearly feast 
  As if it came round every day.

[74.] G   But Hippias the Erythraean, in the second book of his Histories of his own Country, relating how the kingdom of Cnopus was subverted by the conduct of his flatterers, [259] says this- "When Cnopus consulted the oracle about his safety, the god, in his answer, enjoined him to sacrifice to the crafty Hermes. And when, after that, he went to Delphi, they who were anxious to put an end to his kingly power in order to establish an oligarchy instead of it, (and those who wished this were Ortyges, and Irus, and Echarus, who, because they were most conspicuous in paying court to the princes, were called adorers and flatters) they, I say, being on a voyage in company with Cnopus, when they were at a distance from land, bound Cnopus and threw him into the sea; and then they sailed to Chios, and getting a force from the tyrants there, Amphiclus and Polytecnus, they sailed by night to Erythrae, and just at the same time the corpse of Cnopus was washed up on the sea-shore at Erythrae, at a place which is now called Leopodum. And while Cleonice, the wife of Cnopus, was busied about the offices due to the corpse (and it was the time of the festival and assembly instituted in honour of Athene Strophaea), on a sudden there is heard the noise of a trumpet; and the city is taken by Ortyges and his troops, and many of the friends of Cnopus are put to death; and Cleonice, hearing what had happened, fled to Colophon.

[75.] G   "But Ortyges and his companions establishing themselves as tyrants, and having possessed themselves of the supreme power in Chios, destroyed all who opposed their proceedings, and they subverted the laws, and themselves managed the whole of the affairs of the state, admitting none of the popular party within the walls. And they established a court of justice outside the walls, before the gates; and there they tried all actions, sitting as judges, clothed in purple cloaks, and in tunics with purple borders, and they wore sandals with many slits in them during the hot weather; but in winter they always walked about in women's shoes; and they let their hair grow, and took great care of it so as to have ringlets dividing it on the top of their head with fillets of yellow and purple. And they wore ornaments of solid gold, like women, and they compelled some of the citizens to carry their litters, and some to act as lictors to them, and some to sweep the roads. And they sent for the sons of some of the citizens to their parties when they supped together; and some they ordered to bring their own wives and daughters within. And on those who disobeyed they inflicted the most extreme punishment.  And if any one of their companions died, then collecting the citizens with their wives and children, they compelled them by violence to utter lamentations over the dead, and to beat their breasts, and to cry out shrilly and loudly with their voices, a man with a scourge standing over them, who compelled them to do so - until Hippotes, the brother of Cnopus, coming to Erythrae with an army at the time of a festival, the people of Erythrae assisting him, set upon the tyrants, and having punished a great many of their companions, slew Ortyges in his flight, and all who were with him, and treated their wives and children with the very extremity of ill-usage, and delivered his country."

[76.] G   Now from all this we may understand, my friends, of how many evils flattery is the cause in human life. For Theopompus, in the nineteenth book of his history of the Transactions of Philippus, says, "Agathocles was a slave, and one of the Penestae in Thessaly, [260] and as he had great influence with Philippus by reason of his flattery of him, and because he was constantly at his entertainments dancing and making him laugh, Philippus sent him to destroy the Perrhaebi, and to govern all that part of the country. And the Macedonian constantly had this kind of people about him, with whom he associated the greater part of his time, because of their fondness for drinking and buffoonery, and in their company he used to deliberate on the most important affairs." And Hegesander the Delphian gives a similar account of him, and relates how he sent a large sum of money to the men who are assembled at Athens at the temple of Heracles in Diomeia, and who say laughable things; and he ordered some men to write down all that was said by them, and to send it to him. And Theopompus, in the twenty-sixth book of his History, says that "Philippus knowing that the Thessalians were an intemperate race, and very profligate in their way of living, prepared some entertainments for them, and endeavoured in every possible manner to make himself agreeable to them. For he danced and revelled, and practised every kind of intemperance and debauchery. And he was by nature a buffoon, and got drunk every day, and he delighted in those occupations which are consistent with such practices, and with those who are called witty men, who say and do things to provoke laughter. And he attached numbers of the Thessalians who were intimate with him to himself, still more by his entertainments than by his presents." And Dionysius the Sicilian used to do very nearly the same thing, as Eubulus the comic poet tells us in his play entitled Dionysius; - 
  But he is harsh and rigorous to the solemn, 
  But most good-humoured to all flatterers, 
  And all who jest with freedom. For he thinks 
  Those men alone are free, though slaves they be.

[77.] G   And indeed Dionysius was not the only person who encouraged and received those who had squandered their estates on drunkenness and gambling and all such debauchery as that, for Philippus also did the same. And Theopompus speaks of such of them in the forty-ninth book of his History, where he writes as follows:- "Philippus kept at a distance all men who were well regulated in their conduct and who took care of their property; but the extravagant and those who lived in gambling and drunkenness he praised and honoured. And therefore he not only took care that they should always have such amusements, but he encouraged them to devote themselves to all sorts of injustice and debauchery besides. For what disgraceful or iniquitous practices were there to which these men were strangers, or what virtuous or respectable habits were there which they did not shun? Did they not at all times go about shaven and carefully made smooth, though they were men? And did not they endeavour to misuse one another though they had beards?  And they used to go about attended by two or three lovers at a time; and they expected no complaisance from others which they were not prepared to exhibit themselves. On which account a man might very reasonably have thought them not ??????? but ???????, and one might have called them not soldiers, but prostitutes. For though they were ?????????? by profession, they were ??????????? by practice. And in addition to all this, instead of loving sobriety, they loved drunkenness; and instead of living respectably they sought every opportunity of robbing and murdering; and as for speaking the truth, and adhering to their agreements, [261] they thought that conduct quite inconsistent with their characters; but to perjure themselves and cheat, they thought the moat venerable behaviour possible. And they disregarded what they had, but they longed for what they had not; and this too, though a great part of Europe belonged to them. For I think that the companions of Philippus, who did not at that time amount to a greater number than eight hundred, had possession so far as to enjoy the fruits of more land than any ten thousand Greeks, who had the most fertile and large estates." And he makes a very similar statement about Dionysius, in his twenty-first book, when he says, "Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily encouraged above all others those who squandered their property in drunkenness and gambling and intemperance of that sort. For he wished every one to become ruined and ready for any iniquity, and all such people he treated with favour and distinction."

[78.] G   And Demetrius Poliorcetes was a man very fond of mirth, as Phylarchus relates in the tenth book of his History [ Fr_19 ]. But in the fourteenth book he writes as follows [ Fr_31 ]:- "Demetrius used to allow men to flatter him at his banquets, and to pour libations in his honour, calling him Demetrius the only king, and Ptolemy only the prefect of the fleet, and Lysimachus only a steward, and Seleucus only a superintendent of elephants, and in this way he incurred no small amount of hatred."  And Herodotus states [ 2.173 ] that Amasis the king of the Egyptians was always a man full of tricks and one who was used to turn his fellow feasters into ridicule; and when he was a private man he says he was very fond of feasting and of jesting, and he was not at all a serious man. # And Nicolaus in the twenty-seventh book of his History, says that Sulla the Roman general was so fond of mimics and buffoons, being a man very much addicted to amusement, that he gave such men several portions of the public land. And the satyric comedies which he wrote himself in his native language, show of how merry and jovial a temperament he was in this way.

[79.] G   And Theophrastus, in his treatise on Comedy, tells us that the Tirynthians, being people addicted to amusement, and utterly useless for all serious business, betook themselves once to the oracle at Delphi in hopes to be relieved from some calamity or other. And that the god answered them, "That if they sacrificed a bull to Poseidon and threw it into the sea without once laughing, the evil would cease." And they, fearing lest they should make a blunder in obeying the oracle, forbade any of the boys to be present at the sacrifice; however, one boy, hearing of what was going to be done, mingled with the crowd, and then when they hooted him and drove him away, "Why," said he, "are you afraid lest I should spoil your sacrifice?" and when they laughed at this question of his, they perceived that the god meant to show them by a fact that an inveterate custom cannot be remedied. And Sosicrates, in the first book of his History of Crete, says that the people of Phaestus have a certain peculiarity, for that they seem to practise saying ridiculous things from their earliest childhood; on which account it has often happened to them to say very reasonable and witty things because of their early habituation: and therefore all the Cretans attribute to them pre-eminence in the accomplishment of raising a laugh.

[80.] G   But after flattery, Anaxandrides the comic poet gives the next place to ostentation in his Apothecary Prophet, speaking thus- 
  Do you reproach me that I'm ostentatious? 
  Why should you do so? for this quality 
  Is far beyond all others, only flattery 
  Excepted: that indeed is best of all.

And Antiphanes speaks of what he calls a ?????????, a flatterer for morsels of bread, in his Gerytades, when he says - 
  You are called a whisperer and ?????????.

And Sannyrion says - 
  What will become of you, you cursed ???????????.

[262] And Philemon says in his Woman made young again - 
  The man is a ?????????.

And Philippides says in his Renovation - 
  Always contending and ?????????????.

But the word ????? especially applies to these parasitical flatterers; for ????? means food, from which come the words ????????, and ????????, which means difficult to be pleased and squeamish. And the word ?????? means that part of the body which receives the food, that is to say, the stomach. Diphilus also uses the word ??????????? in his Theseus, saying - 
  They call you a runaway ???????????.

Athenaeus: The Deipnosophists
BOOK 7 (excerpts)

Translated by C.D.Yonge (1854). A few words and spellings have been changed.

See key to translations for an explanation of the format. The page numbers in the Greek text are shown in red. The chapter numbers in the translation are shown in green. 

[1.] G   [275] And when the banquet was now finished, the cynics, thinking that the festival of the Phagesia {"eating festival"} was being celebrated, were delighted above all things, and Cynulcus said, - While we are supping, O Ulpianus, since it is on words that you are feasting us, I propose to you this question, - In what author do you find any mention of the festivals called Phagesia, and Phagesiposia? And he, hesitating, and bidding the slaves desist from carrying the dishes round, though it was now evening, said, - I do not recollect, you very wise man, so that you may tell us yourself, in order that you may sup more abundantly and more pleasantly. And he replied, - If you will promise to thank me when I have told you, I will tell you. And as he agreed to thank him, he continued, - Clearchus, a pupil of Aristotle and a native of Soli, in the first book of his treatise on Pictures (for I recollect his very expressions, because I took a great fancy to them), speaks as follows :- "Phagesia - but some call the festival Phagesiposia - but this festival has ceased, as also has that of the rhapsodists, which they celebrated about the time of the Dionysia, in which everyone as they passed by sang a hymn to the god by way of doing him honour." This is what Clearchus wrote. [276] And if you doubt it, my friend, I, who have got the book, will not mind lending it to you. And you may learn a good deal from it, and get a great many questions to ask us out of it. For he relates that Callias the Athenian composed a Grammatical Tragedy, from which Euripides in his Medea, and Sophocles in his Oedipus, derived their choruses and the arrangement of their plot,

[2.] G   And when all the guests marvelled at the literary accomplishments of Cynulcus, Plutarchus said, - In like manner there used to be celebrated in my own Alexandria a Flagon-bearing festival, which is mentioned by Eratosthenes in his treatise entitled Arsino?. And he speaks as follows: - "When Ptolemy was instituting a festival and all kinds of sacrifices, and especially those which relate to Dionysus, Arsino? asked the man who bore the branches, what day he was celebrating now, and what festival it was. And when he replied, 'It is called the Lagynophoria ; and the guests lie down on beds and so eat all that they have brought with them, and everyone drinks out of his own flagon which he has brought from home;' and when he had departed, she, looking towards us, said, 'It seems a very dirty kind of party ; for it is quite evident that it must be an assembly of a mixed multitude, all putting down stale food and such as is altogether unseasonable and unbecoming.' But if the kind of feast had pleased her, then the queen would not have objected to preparing the very same things herself, as is done at the festival called Choes {"pitchers"}. For there everyone feasts separately, and the inviter only supplies the materials for the feast."

[3.] G   But one of the grammarians who were present, looking on the preparation of the feast, said, - In the next place, how shall we ever be able to eat so large a supper? Perhaps we are to go on "during the night," as that witty writer Aristophanes says in his Aeolosicon, where however his expression is "during the whole night." And, indeed, Homer uses the preposition ??? in the same way, for he says { Od_9'298 } - 
  He lay within the cave stretched over the sheep ; 
where ??? ????? means "over all the sheep," indicating the size of the giant. And Daphnus the physician answered him, - Meals taken late at night, my friend, are more advantageous for everybody. For the influence of the moon is well adapted to promote the digestion of food, since the moon has putrefying properties ; and digestion depends upon putrefaction. Accordingly victims slain at night are more digestible; and wood which is cut down by moonlight decays more rapidly. And also the greater proportion of fruits ripen by moonlight.

[4.] G   But since there were great many sorts of fish, and those very different both as to size and beauty, which had been served up and which were still being constantly served up for the guests, Myrtilus said, - Although all the different dishes which we eat, besides the regular meal, are properly called by one generic name, ???? , still it is very deservedly that on account of its delicious taste fish has prevailed over everything else, and has appropriated the name to itself; because men are so exceedingly enamoured of this kind of food. Accordingly we speak of men as ????????, not meaning people who eat beef (such as Heracles was, who ate beef and green figs mixed together); nor do we mean by such a term a man who is fond of figs; as was Plato the philosopher, according to the account given of him by Phanocritus in his treatise On Eudoxus : and he tells us in the same book that Arcesilas was fond of grapes : but we mean by the term only those people who haunt the fish-market. And Philippus of Macedon was fond of apples, and so was his son Alexander, as Dorotheus tells us in the sixth book of his History of the Life and Actions of Alexander. [277] But Chares of Mitylene relates that Alexander, having found the finest apples which he had ever seen in the country around Babylon, filled boats with them, and had a battle of apples from the vessels, so as to present a most beautiful spectacle. And I am not ignorant that, properly speaking, whatever is prepared for being eaten by the agency of fire is called ???? . For indeed the word is either identical with ????, or else perhaps it is derived from ????? {"to roast"}.

[10.] G   [279]  But the Epicureans are not the only men who are addicted to pleasure; but so too are the Cyrenaic philosophers, and the [Thasians] who call themselves followers of Mnesistratus; for these men delight to live luxuriously . . . as Poseidonius [ Fr_106 ] tells us. And Speusippus did not much differ from them, though he was a pupil and a relation of Plato's. At all events, Dionysius the tyrant, in his letters to him, enumerating all the instances of his devotion to pleasure, and also of his covetousness, and reproaching him with having levied contributions on numbers of people, attacks him also on account of his love for Lastheneia, the Arcadian courtesan. And, at the end of all, he says this- "Whom do you charge with covetousness, when you yourself omit no opportunity of amassing base gain? For what is there that you have been ashamed to do? Are you not now attempting to collect contributions, after having paid yourself for Hermeias all that he owed?"

[11.] G   And about Epicurus, Timon, in the third book of his Silli, speaks as follows:- 
  Seeking at all times to indulge his stomach, 
  Than which there's no more greedy thing on earth.

For, on account of his stomach, and of the rest of his sensual pleasures, the man was always flattering Idomeneus and Metrodorus. And Metrodorus himself, not at all disguising this admirable principle of his, [280] says, somewhere or other, "The fact is, Timocrates, my natural philosopher, that every investigation which is guided by principles of nature, fixes its ultimate aim entirely on gratifying the stomach." For Epicurus was the tutor of all these men; who said, shouting it out, as I may say, "The fountain and root of every good is the pleasure of the stomach: and all wise rules, and all excellent rules, are measured alike by this standard." And in his treatise On the Chief Good, he speaks nearly as follows: "For, I am not able to understand what is good, if I leave out of consideration the pleasures which arise from delicately-flavoured food, and if I also leave out the pleasures which arise from love affairs; and if I also omit those which arise from music, and those, too, which are derived from the contemplation of beauty and the gratification of the eyesight." And, proceeding a little further, he says, "All that is beautiful is naturally to be honoured; and so is virtue, and everything of that sort, if it assists in producing or causing pleasure. But if it does not contribute to that end, then it may be disregarded."

[12.] G   And before Epicurus, Sophocles, the tragic poet, in his Antigone [ 1165 ], had uttered these sentiments respecting pleasure- 
  For when men utterly forsake all pleasure, 
  I reckon such a man no longer living, 
  But look upon him as a breathing corpse. 
  He may have, if you like, great wealth at home, 
  And go in monarch's guise; but if his wealth 
  And power bring no pleasure to his mind, 
  I would not for a moment deem it all 
  Worth the shadow of smoke, compared with pleasure.

And Philetaerus says, in his Huntress, 
  For what, I pray you, should a mortal do, 
  But seek for every way and means 
  To make his life from day to day pass happily? 
  This should be all our object and our aim, 
  Reflecting on the chance of human life. 
  And never let us think about to-morrow, 
  Whether it will arrive at all or not. 
  It is a foolish trouble to lay up 
  Money which may become stale and useless.

And the same poet says, in his Oenopion, 
  But every man who lives but sparingly, 
  Having sufficient means, I call and think 
  Of all men the most truly miserable. 
  For when you're dead, you cannot then eat eels; 
  They cook no wedding feasts in the underworld.

[13.] G   And Apollodorus of Carystus, in his Tablet-Maker, says- 
  O men, whoe'er you are, why do you now 
  Scorn pleasant living, and turn all your thoughts 
  To do each other mischief in fierce war? 
  In God's name, tell me, does some odious fate, 
  Rude and unlettered, destitute of all 
  That can be knowledge called, or education, 
  Ignorant of what is bad and what is good, 
  Guide all your destiny?- a fate which settles 
  All your affairs at random by mere chance? 
  I think it must be so: for else, what fate, 
  Being truly Greek at heart, would ever choose 
  To see Greeks by each other thus despoiled, 
  And falling dead in ghastly heaps of corpses, 
  When she might see them sportive, gay, and jesting, 
  Drinking full cups, and singing to the flute? 
  Tell me, my friend, I pray, and put to shame 
  This most unpolished clownish fortune.

And then he proceeds to say- 
  Does not a life, like this deserve the name 
  Of godlike?- Think how far more pleasant all 
  Affairs would be in our communities 
  Than now they are, if we were but to change 
  Our fashions, and our habits, and our principles 
  One little bit. Why should we not proclaim, 
  [281] "Every Athenian of less than thirty years of age, 
  Let him come forth and drink. Let all the cavalry 
  Go to a feast at Corinth, for ten days, 
  Crowned with chaplets, and perfumed most sweetly. 
  Let the Megarians sell and boil their cabbages. 
  Bid all the allies now hasten to the bath, 
  And mix in cups the rich Euboean wine." 
  Sure this is real luxury and life, 
  But we are slaves to a most clownish fortune.

[14.] G   The poets say that that ancient hero, Tantalus, was also greatly devoted to pleasure. At all events, the author of the book called The Return of the Atreidae says "that he, when he had arrived among the gods and had begun to live among them, had leave given him by Zeus to ask for whatever he wished; and that he, being a man quite insatiable in the gratification of his appetite, asked that it might be granted to him to indulge them to their full extent, and to live in the same manner as the gods. And that Zeus was indignant at this request, and, according to his promise, fulfilled his prayer; but still, that he might not enjoy what he had before him, but be everlastingly tormented, he hung a stone over his head, on account of which he should be unable to get at any of the things which he had before him." Some of the Stoics also were addicted to this kind of pleasure. At all events, Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who was a pupil of Ariston the Chian, who was one of the sect of the Stoics, in his treatise which is entitled Ariston, represents his master as subsequently being much addicted to luxury, speaking as follows: "And before now, I have at times discovered him breaking down, as it were, the partition wall between pleasure and virtue, and appearing on the side of pleasure." And Apollophanes (and he was an acquaintance of Ariston), in his Ariston (for he also wrote a book with that title), shows the way in which his master was addicted to pleasure.  # And why need we mention Dionysius of Heracleia? who openly discarded his covering of virtue, and put on a robe embroidered with flowers, and assumed the name of "The altered man" [Metathemenos]; and, although he was an old man, he apostatized from the doctrines of the Stoics, and passed over to the school of Epicurus; and, in consequence, Timon said of him, not without some point and felicity - 
  When it is time to set [??????], he now begins 
  To sit at table [?????????]. But there is a time 
  To love, a time to wed, a time to cease.

[15.] G   Apollodorus the Athenian, in the third book of his treatise on A Modest and Prudent Man, which is addressed to those whom he calls Male Buffoons, having first used the expression, "more libidinous than the very Inventors themselves [????????]," says, there are some fish called alphestae, being all of a tawny colour, though they have a purple hue in some parts. And they say that they are usually caught in couples, and that one is always found following at the tail of the other; and therefore, from the fact of one following close on the tail of the other, some of the ancients call men who are intemperate and libidinous by the same name. But Aristotle, in his work on Animals, says that this fish, which he calls alphestikos, has but a single spine, and is of a tawny colour. [282] And Numenius of Heracleia mentions it, in his treatise on Fishing, speaking as follows:- 
  The fish that lives in seaweed, the alphestes, 
  The scorpion also with its rosy meat.

And Epicharmus, in his Marriage of Hebe, says- 
  Mussels, alphestae, and the girl-like fish, 
  The dainty coracinus.

Mithaecus also mentions it in his Culinary Art.

[33.] G   [289] I swear by Athene that Menecrates the Syracusan himself would not have made such a boast as that, he who was nick-named Zeus - a man who gave himself airs as being, by his skill in medicine, the only person who could cause man to live. Accordingly he compelled all who came to be cured by him of what is called the sacred disease, to enter into a written agreement that if they recovered they would be his slaves. And they followed him one wearing the dress of Heracles, and being called Heracles, ( and the man who was so called was Nicostratus, an Argive, who had been cured of the sacred disease, and he is mentioned by Ephippus, in his Peltast, where he says -
  Did not Menecrates call himself a god, 
  And Nicostratus of Argos a second Heracles? ) 
and another followed him in the dress of Hermes, having on a cloak and bearing a caduceus, and wings besides.  As Nicagoras of Zeleia did, who also became afterwards the tyrant of his country, as Baton relates in the history of the Tyrants at Ephesus. And Hegesander says that he called Astycreon, who had been cured by him, Apollo. And another of those who had been cured by him, went about with him to his cost, wearing the dress of Asclepius. But Zeus Menecrates himself, clad in purple, and having a golden crown upon his head, and holding a sceptre, and being shod with slippers, went about with his chorus of gods. And once, writing to Philippus the king, he began his letter thus -

[34.] G   "Menecrates Zeus to Philippus greeting. 
You, indeed, are king of Macedonia, but I am king of medicine; and you are able, when you please, to put men to death, who are in health; but I am able to save those who are sick, and to cause those who are in good health, if they only follow my advice, to live to old age without being attacked by disease. Therefore the Macedonians attend you as body-guards; but all who wish to live attend me; for I, Zeus, give them life."

And so Philippus wrote back to him as to a man out of his senses,- "Philippus wishes Menecrates soundness."  And he wrote in similar style to Archidamus, the king of the Lacedaemonians, and to every one else to whom be wrote at all; never omitting to give himself the name of Zeus. And once Philippus invited him and all his gods to supper, and placed them all on the centre couch, which was adorned in the loftiest and most holy-looking and beautiful manner. And he had a table placed before them on which there was an altar and first-fruits of the different productions of the earth. And whenever eatables were placed before the other guests, the slaves placed incense before Menecrates, and poured libations in his honour. And at last, the new Zeus, with all his subordinate gods, being laughed at by every one, ran away and fled from the banquet, as Hegesander relates. And Alexis also makes mention of Menecrates in his Minos.

[35.] G   And Themison the Cyprian, the friend of Antiochus the king, as Pythermus the Ephesian relates in the eighth book of his History, not only used to have his name proclaimed in the public assemblies, "Themison, the Macedonian, [290] the Heracles of Antiochus the king;" but all the people of that country used to sacrifice to him, addressing him as Heracles Themison; and he himself would come when any of the nobles celebrated a sacrifice, and would sit down, having a couch to himself, and being clad in a lion's skin, and he used also to bear a Scythian bow, and in his hand, he carried a club.

Menecrates then himself, though he was such as we have said, never made such a preposterous boast as the cook we have been speaking of, - 
  I am immortal, for I bring the dead, 
  By the mere smell of my meat, to life again.

[81.] G   [262] When Democritus had made this speech, and had asked for some drink in a narrow-necked sabrias, Ulpianus said, And what is this sabrias? And just as Democritus was beginning to treat us all to a number of interminable stories, in came a troop of servants bringing in everything requisite for eating. Concerning whom Democritus, continuing his discourse, spoke as follows:- I have always, O my friends, marvelled at the race of slaves, considering how abstemious they are, though placed in the middle of such numbers of dainties; for they pass them by, not only out of fear, but also because they are taught to do so; I do not mean being taught, as in the Slave-teacher of Pherecrates, but by early habituation; and without its being necessary to utter any express prohibition respecting such matters to them, as in the island of Cos, when the citizens sacrifice to Hera. For Macareus says, in his third book of his treatise on Coan Affairs, that, when the Coans sacrifice to Hera, no slave is allowed to enter the temple, nor does any slave taste any one of the things which are prepared for the sacrifice. And Antiphanes, in his Dyspratus, says - 
  'Tis hard to see around one savoury cakes, 
  And delicate birds half eaten; yet the slaves 
  Are not allowed to eat the fragments even, 
  As say the women.

And Epicrates, in his Dyspratus ['Hard to Sell'], introduces a servant expressing his indignation, and saying - 
  What can be worse than, while the guests are drinking, 
  To hear the constant cry of, Here, boy, here! 
  And this that one may bear a chamber-pot 
  To some vain beardless youth; and see around 
  Half eaten savoury cakes, and delicate birds, 
  Whose very fragments are forbidden strictly 
  To all the slaves - at least the women say so; 
  And him who drinks a cup men call a belly-god; 
  And if he tastes a mouthful of solid food 
  They call him greedy glutton: 
from the comparison of which iambics, it is very plain that Epicrates borrowed Antiphanes's lines, and transferred them to his own play.

[82.] G   And Dieuchidas says, in his history of the Affairs of Megara- "Around the islands called Araeae (and they are between Cnidus and Syme) a difference arose, after the death of Triopas, among those who had set out with him on his expedition, and some returned home, and others remained with Phorbas, and came to Ialysus, and others proceeded with Periergus, and occupied the district of Cameirus. And on this it is said that Periergus uttered curses againt Phorbas, and on this account the islands were called Araeae. But Phorbas having met with shipwreck, he and Parthenia, the sister of Phorbas and Periergus, swam ashore to Ialysus, at the point called Schedia. And Thamneus met with them, as he happened to be hunting near Schedia, and took them to his own house, intending to receive them hospitably, and sent on a servant as a messenger to tell his wife to prepare everything necessary, as he was bringing home strangers. [263] But when he came to his house and found nothing prepared, he himself put corn into a mill, and everything else that was requisite, and then ground it himself and feasted them. And Phorbas was so delighted with this hospitality, that when he was dying himself he charged his friends to take care that his funeral rites should be performed by free men. And so this custom continued to prevail in the sacrifice of Phorbas, for none but free men minister at this sacrifice. And it is accounted profanation for any slave to approach it."

[83.] G   And since among the different questions proposed by Ulpianus, there is this one about the slaves, let us now ourselves recapitulate a few things which we have to say on the subject, remembering what we have in former times read about it. For Pherecrates, in his Boors, says - 
  For no one then had any Manes, no, 
  Nor home-born slaves; but the free women themselves 
  Did work at everything within the house. 
  And so at morn they ground the corn for bread, 
  Till all the streets resounded with the mills.

And Anaxandrides, in his Anchises, says - 
  Slaves are not citizens, my friend, 
  Of any city; but fortune regulates 
  And changes at will the state of these men. 
  Many there are who are not free today, 
  But will tomorrow free-men be of Sunium, 
  And the day after public orators; 
  For so the deity guides each man's helm.

[84.] G   And Poseidonius, the stoic philosopher, says in the eleventh book of his History [ Fr_8 ], "That many men, who are unable to govern themselves, by reason of the weakness of their intellect, give themselves up to the guidance of those who are wiser than themselves, in order that receiving from them care and advice, and assistance in necessary matters, they may in their turn requite them with such services as they are able to render. And in this manner the Mariandyni became subject to the people of Heracleia, promising to act as their subjects for ever, it they would supply them with what they stood in need of; having made an agreement beforehand, that none of them would be sold outside of the territory of Heracleia, but that they would stay in that district alone. And perhaps it is on this account that Euphorion the epic poet called the Mariandyni Bringers of Gifts, saying - 
  And they may well be called Bringers of Gifts, 
  Fearing the stern dominion of their kings.

And Callistratus the pupil of Aristophanes says that they called the Mariandyni tribute-bearers [?????????], by that appellation taking away whatever there is bitter in the name of servants, just as the Spartans did in respect of the Helots, the Thessalians in the case of the Penestae, and the Cretans with the Clarotae. But the Cretans call those servants who are in their houses chrysoneti ['bought with gold'], and those whose work lies in the fields Amphamiotae, being natives of the country, but people who have been enslaved by the chance of war; but they also call the same people Clarotae, because they have been distributed among their masters by lot (??????).

And Ephorus, in the third book of his Histories, says, "The Cretans call their slaves Clarotae, because lots have been drawn for them; and these slaves have some regularly recurring festivals in Cydonia, during which no freemen enter the city, but the slaves are the masters of everything, and have the right even to scourge the freemen." But Sosicrates, in the second book of his history of Cretan Affairs, says, "The Cretans call public servitude ?????, but the private slaves they cell aphamiotae; and the perioeci, or peop1e who live in the adjacent districts, they call subjects. [264] And Dosiadas gives a very similar account in the fourth book of his history of Cretan Affairs.

[85.] G   But the Thessalians call those Penestae who wore not born slaves, but who have been taken prisoners in war. And Theopompus the comic poet, misapplying the word, says - 
  The wrinkled counsellors of a Penestan master.

And Philocrates in the second book of his history of the Affairs of Thessaly, if at least the work attributed to him is genuine, says that the Penestae are also called Thessaloecetae, or servants of the Thessalians. And Archemachus in the third book of his history of the Affairs of Euboea, says, "When the Boeotians had founded Arnaea, those of them who did not return to Boeotia, but who took a fancy to their new country, gave themselves up to the Thessalians by agreement, to be their slaves; on condition that they should not take them out of the country, nor put them to death, but that they should cultivate the country for them, and pay them a yearly revenue for it. These men, therefore, abiding by their agreement, and giving themselves up to the Thessalians, were called at that time Menestae ['stayers']; but now they are called Penestae; and many of them are richer than their masters. And Euripides, in his Phrixus, calls them latriae in these words- 
  Servant-toiler of my ancient home [?????? ???????? ???? ??????? ?????].

[86.] G   And Timaeus of Tauromenium, in the ninth book of his Histories, says, "It was not a national custom among the Greeks in former times to be waited on by purchased slaves;" and he proceeds to say, "And altogether they accused Aristotle of having departed from the Locrian customs; for they said that it was not customary among the Locrians, nor among the Phocians, to use either maid-servants or house-servants till very recently. But the wife of Philomelus, who took Delphi, was the first woman who had two maids to follow her. And in a similar manner Mnason, the companion of Aristotle, was much reproached among the Phocians, for having purchased a thousand slaves; for they said that be was depriving that number of citizens of their necessary subsistence for that it was a custom in their houses for the younger men to minister to the elder."

[87.] G   And Plato, in the sixth book of the Laws [ 776'b ], says,- "The whole question about servants is full of difficulty; for of all the Greeks, the system of the Helots among the Lacedaemonians causes the greatest perplexity and dispute, some people affirming that it is a wise institution, and some considering it as of a very opposite character. But the system of slavery among the people of Heracleia would cause less dispute than the subject condition of the Mariandyni; and so too would the condition of the Thessalian Penestae. And if we consider all these things, what ought we to do with respect to the acquisition of servants? For there is nothing sound in the feelings of slaves; nor ought a prudent man to trust them in anything of importance. And the wisest of all poets says [ Hom:Od_17'322 ] - 
  Zeus fixed it certain that whatever day 
  Makes man a slave, takes half his worth away.

And it has been frequently shown by facts, that a slave is an objectionable and perilous possession; especially in the frequent revolts of the Messenians, and in the case of those cities which have many slaves, speaking different languages, in which many evils arise from that circumstance. And also we may come to the same conclusion from the exploits and sufferings of all sorts of robbers, who infest the Italian coasts as piratical vagabonds. And if any one considers all these circumstances, [265] he may well doubt what course ought to be pursued with respect to all these people. Two remedies now are left to us - either never to allow, for the future, our slaves to be one another's fellow-countrymen, and, as far as possible, to prevent their even speaking the same language; or to keep them well, not only for their sake, but still more for our own; and we should behave towards them with as little insolence as possible. But it is right to chastise them with justice; not admonishing them as if they were free men, so as to make them arrogant: and every word which we address to slaves ought to be, in some sort, a command. And a man ought never to play at all with his slaves, or jest with them, whether they be male or female. And as to the very foolish way in which many people treat their slaves, allowing them great indulgence and great licence, they only make everything more difficult for both parties: they make obedience harder for the one to practice, and authority harder for the other to exercise.

[88.] G   Now of all the Greeks, I conceive that the Chians were the first people who used slaves purchased with money, as is related by Theopompus, in the seventeenth book of his Histories; where he says,- "The Chians were the first of the Greeks, after the Thessalians and Lacedaemonians, who used slaves. But they did not acquire them in the same manner as those others did; for the Lacedaemonians and the Thessalians will be found to have derived their slaves from Greek tribes, who formerly inhabited the country which they now possess: the one having Achaean slaves, but the Thessalians having Perrhaebian and Magnesian slaves; and the one nation called their slaves Helots, and the others called them Penestae. But the Chians have barbarian slaves, and they have bought them at a price." Theopompus, then, has given this account. But I think that, on this account, the Deity was angry with the Chians; for at a subsequent period they were subdued by their slaves. Accordingly, Nymphodorus the Syracusan, in his Voyage along the Coast of Asia, gives this account of them :- "The slaves of the Chians deserted them, and escaped to the mountains; and then, collecting in great numbers, ravaged the country-houses about; for the island is very rugged and much overgrown with trees. But, a little before our time, the Chians themselves relate, that one of their slaves deserted, and took up his habitation in the mountains; and, being a man of great courage and very prosperous in his warlike undertakings, he assumed the command of the runaway slaves, as a king would take the command of an army; and though the Chians often made expeditions against him, they were able to effect nothing. And when Drimacus (for that was the name of this runaway slave) saw that they were being destroyed, without being able to effect anything, he addressed them in this language: 'O Chians! you who are the masters, this treatment which you are now receiving from your servants will never cease; for how should it cease, when it is God who causes it, in accordance with the prediction of the oracle? But if you will be guided by me, and if you will leave us in peace, then I will be the originator of much good fortune to you.'

[89.] G   "Accordingly, the Chians entered into a treaty with him, and made a truce for a certain time. Drimacus prepared measures and weights, and a private seal for himself; and, throwing it to the Chians, he said, 'Whatever I take from any one of you, I shall take according to these measures and these weights; and when I have taken enough, I will then leave the storehouses, having sealed them up with this seal. And as to all the slaves who desert from you, I will inquire what cause of complaint they have; and if they seem to me to have been really subject to any incurable oppression, which has been the reason of their running away, I will retain them with me; but if they have no sufficient or reasonable ground to allege, [266] I will send them back to their masters.' Accordingly, the rest of the slaves, seeing that the Chians agreed to this state of things very good-humouredly, did not desert nearly so much for the future, fearing the judgment which Drimacus might pass upon them. And the runaways who were with him feared him a great deal more than they did their own masters, and did everything that he required, obeying him as their general; for he punished the disobedient with great severity: and he permitted no one to ravage the land, nor to commit any other crime of any sort, without his consent. And at the time of festivals, he went about, and took from the fields wine, and such animals for victims as were in good condition, and whatever else the masters were inclined or able to give him; and if he perceived that any one was intriguing against him, or laying any plot to injure him or overthrow his power, he chastised him.

[90.] G   "Then (for the city had made a proclamation, that it would give a great reward to any one who took him prisoner, or who brought in his head,) this Drimacus, as he became older, calling one of his most intimate friends into a certain place, says to him, 'You know that I have loved you above all men, and you are to me as my child and my son, and as everything else. I now have lived long enough, but you are young and just in the prime of life. What, then, are we to do? You must show yourself a wise and brave man; for, since the city of the Chians offers a great reward to any one who shall kill me, and also promises him his freedom, you must cut off my head, and carry it to Chios, and receive the money which they offer, and so be prosperous.' But, when the young man refused, he at last persuaded him to do so; and so he cut off his head, and took it to the Chians, and received from them the rewards which they had offered by proclamation: and, having buried the corpse of Drimacus, he departed to his own country. And the Chians, being again injured and plundered by their slaves, remembering the moderation of him who was dead, erected a Heroum in their country, and called it the shrine of the Gentle Hero. And even now the runaway slaves bring to that shrine the first-fruits of all the plunder they get; and they say that Drimacus still appears to many of the Chians in their sleep, and informs them beforehand of the stratagems of their slaves who are plotting against them: and to whomsoever he appears, they come to that place, and sacrifice to him, where this shrine is."

[91.] G   Nymphodorus, then, has given this account; but in many copies of his history, I have found that Drimacus is not mentioned by name. But I do not imagine that any one of you is ignorant of what the prince of all historians, Herodotus [ 8.105 ], has said about Panionius of Chios, who castrated free boys and sold them, and the just punishment which he suffered.  # But Nicolaus the Peripatetic, and Poseidonius the Stoic [ Fr_38 ], in their Histories, both state that the Chians were enslaved by Mithridates, the tyrant of Cappadocia; and were given up by him, bound, to their own slaves, for the purpose of being transported into the land of the Colchians,- so really angry with them was the Deity, as being the first people who used purchased slaves, while most other nations provided for themselves by their own industry. And, perhaps, this is what the proverb originated in, "A Chian bought a master," which is used by Eupolis, in his Friends.

[92.] G   But the Athenians, having a prudent regard to the condition of their slaves, made a law that, there should be a charge of outrage [????? ??????], even against men who ill treated their slaves. Accordingly, Hypereides, the orator, in his speech against Mantitheus, on a charge of assault [?????], says, [267] "They made these laws not only for the protection of freemen, but they enacted also, that even if any one personally ill-treated a slave, there should be a power of preferring an indictment against him who bad done so." And Lycurgus made a similar statement, in his first speech against Lycophron; and so did Demosthenes, in his oration against Meidias. And Malacus, in his Annals of the Siphnians, relates that some slaves of the Samians colonized Ephesus, being a thousand men in number; who in the first instance revolted against their masters, and fled to the mountain which is in the island, and from thence did great injury to the Samians.  But, in the sixth year after these occurrences, the Samians, by the advice of an oracle, made a treaty with the slaves, on certain agreements; and the slaves were allowed to depart uninjured from the island and, sailing away, they occupied Ephesus, and the Ephesians are descended from these ancestors.

[93.] G   But Chrysippus says that there is a difference between a ?????? and an ???????; and he draws the distinction in the second book of his treatise on Similarity of Meaning, because he says that those who have been emancipated are still ??????, but that the term ??????? is confined to those who are not discharged from servitude; for the ???????, says he, is a ??????, being actually at the time the property of a master. And all the following are called ??????, as Cleitarchus says, in his treatise on Dialects; ???? and ?????????? and ?????????, and ????????, and ???????? and also ???????? and ???????. And Amerias says, that the slaves who are employed about the fields are called ???????. And Hermon, in his treatise on the Cretan Dialects, says that slaves of noble birth are called ??????. And Seleucus says, that both men and maid servants are called ????; and that a female slave is often called ???????? and ??????; and that a slave who is the son of a slave is called ???????; and that ????????? is a name properly belonging to a female slave who is about her mistress's person, and that a ???????? is one who walks before her mistress.

But Proxenus, in the second book of his treatise on the Lacedaemonian Constitution, says that female servants are called among the Lacedaemonians, ????????. But Ion of Chios, in his Laertes, uses the word ??????? as synonymous with ??????, and says- 
  Alas, O servant, go on wings and close 
  The house lest any man should enter in.

And Achaeus, in his Omphale, speaking of the Satyr, says - 
  How rich in slaves [????????] and how well housed he was [???????]; 
using, however, in my opinion, the words ???????? and ??????? in a peculiar sense, as meaning rather, good to his slaves and servants, taking ??????? from ???????.  And it is generally understood that an ??????? is a servant whose business is confined to the house, and that it is possible he may be a freeborn man.

[94.] G   But the poets of the old comedy, speaking of the old-fashioned way of life, and asserting that in olden time there was no great use of slaves, speak in this way. Cratinus, in his Pluti, says - 
  As for those men, those heroes old, - 
  Who lived in Saturn's time, 
  When men did play at dice with loaves, 
  And Aeginetan cakes 
  Of barley well and brownly baked 
  Were rolled down before men 
  Who did in the palaestra toil, 
  Full of hard lumps of dough . . .

And Crates says, in his Beasts - 
  (A)   Then no one shall possess or own 
  One male or female slave, 
  But shall himself, though ne'er so old, 
  Labour for all his needs. 
  (B)   Not so, for I will quickly make 
  These matters all come right.. 
  (A)   And what will your plans do for us? 
  (B)   Why everything you call for 
  Should of its own accord come forth, 
  As if now you should say, 
  O table, lay yourself for dinner, 
  And spread a cloth upon you. 
  You kneading-trough, prepare some dough; 
  You cyathus, pour forth wine; 
  Where is the cup? come hither, cup, 
  And empty and wash yourself. 
  Come up, O cake. You sir, you dish, 
  Here, bring me up some beetroot. 
  Come hither, fish. "I can't, for I 
  Am raw on the other side." 
  Well, turn round then and baste yourself 
  With oil and melted butter.

[268] And immediately after this the man who takes up the opposite side of the argument says - 
  But argue thus: I on the other hand 
  Shall first of all bring water for the hot baths 
  On columns raised as through the Paeonium 
  Down to the sea, so that the stream shall flow 
  Direct to every private person's bath. 
  Then he shall speak and check the flowing water. 
  Then too an alabaster box of ointment 
  Shall of its own accord approach the bather, 
  And sponges suitable, and also slippers.

[95.] G   And Telecleides puts it better than the man whom I have just quoted, in his Amphictyons, where he says- 
  I will tell you now the life 
  Which I have prepared for men. 
  First of all the lovely Peace 
  Everywhere was always by, 
  Like spring water which is poured 
  Over the hands of feasted guests. 
  The earth produced no cause for fear, 
  No pains and no diseases. 
  And everything a man could want 
  Came forth unasked for to him. 
  The streams all ran with rosy wine, 
  And barley-cakes did fight 
  With wheaten loaves which first could reach 
  A hungry man's open month. 
  And each entreated to be eaten, 
  If men loved dainty whiteness. 
  Fish too came straight unto men's doors, 
  And fried themselves all ready, 
  Dished themselves up, and stood before 
  The guests upon the tables. 
  A stream of soup did flow along 
  In front of all the couches, 
  Rolling down lumps of smoking meat; 
  And rivulets of white sauce 
  Brought to all such as chose to eat 
  The sweetest forced-meat balls. 
  So that there was no lack, but all 
  Did eat whatever they wanted. 
  Dishes there were of boiled meat too, 
  And sausages likewise and pasties; 
  And roasted thrushes and rissoles 
  Flew down men's throats spontaneously. 
  Then there were sounds of cheesecakes too 
  Crushed in men's hungry jaws: 
  While the boys played with dainty bits 
  Of tripe, and paunch, and liver. 
  No wonder men did on such fare 
  Get stout and strong as giants.

[96.] G   And in the name of Demeter, my companions, if these things went on in this way, I should like to know what need we should have of servants. But the ancients, accustoming us to provide for ourselves, instructed us by their actions while they feasted us in words. But I, in order to show you in what manner succeeding poets (since the most admirable Cratinus brandished the before-cited verses like a torch) imitated and amplified them, have quoted these plays in the order in which they were exhibited. And if I do not annoy you, (for as for the Cynics I do not care the least bit for them,) I will quote to you some sentences from the other poets, taking them also in regular order; one of which is that strictest Atticist of all, namely Pherecrates, who in his Miners says - 
  (A)   But all those things were heaped in confusion 
  By overgrown wealth, abounding altogether 
  In every kind of luxury. There were rivers 
  With tender pulse and blackest soup overflowing, 
  Which ran down brawling through the narrow dishes, 
  Bearing the crusts and spoons away in the flood. 
  Then there were dainty closely kneaded cakes; 
  So that the food, both luscious and abundant, 
  Descended to the gullets of the dead. 
  There were black-puddings and large boiling slices 
  Of well-mixed sausages, which hissed within 
  The smoking streamlet just like oysters. 
  There too were cutlets of broiled fish well seasoned 
  With sauce of every kind, and cook, and country. 
  [269] There were huge legs of pork, most tender meat, 
  Loading enormous platters; and boiled trotters 
  Sending a savoury steam; and paunch of ox; 
  And well-cured ribs of pork, red with salt, 
  A dainty dish, on fried meat balls upraised. 
  There too were cakes of groats well steeped in milk, 
  In large flat dishes, and rich plates of beestings. 
  (B)   Alas, you will destroy me. Why do you 
  Remain here longer, when you thus may dive 
  Just as you are beneath deep Tartarus? 
  (A)   What will you say then when you hear the rest? 
  For roasted thrushes nicely browned and hot 
  Flew to the mouths of the guests, entreating them 
  To deign to swallow them, besprinkled o'er 
  With myrtle leaves and flowers of anemone, 
  And plates of loveliest apples hung around 
  Above our heads, hanging in air as it seemed. 
  And maidens in the most transparent robes, 
  Just come to womanhood, and crowned with roses, 
  Did through a strainer pour full red cups 
  Of fragrant wine for all who wished to drink. 
  And whatsoever each guest did eat or drink 
  Straight reappeared in twofold quantity.

[97.] G   And in his Persians he says - 
  But what need, I pray you now, 
  Have we of all you ploughmen, 
  Or carters, mowers, reapers too, 
  Or coopers, or brass-founders? 
  What need we seed, or furrow's line? 
  For of their own accord 
  Rivers do flow down every road 
  (Though half choked up with spice-cakes) 
  Of rich black soup, which rolls along 
  Within its greasy flood 
  Achilles' fat barley-cake, 
  And streams of sauce which flow 
  Straight down from Plutus' own springs, 
  For all the guests to relish. 
  Meantime Zeus rains down fragrant wine, 
  As if it were a bath, 
  And from the roof red strings of grapes 
  Hang down, with well made cakes, 
  Watered the while with smoking soup, 
  And mixed with savoury omelettes. 
  Even all the trees upon the hills 
  Will put forth leaves of paunches, 
  Kids' paunches, and young cuttlefish, 
  And smoking roasted thrushes.

[98.] G   And why need I quote in addition to this the passages from the Tagenistae of the incomparable Aristophanes? For you are all of you full of his mockery. And when I have just repeated the passage out of the Thurio-Persae of Metagenes I will say no more, and discard all notice of the Sirens of Nicophon, in which we find the following lines - 
  Let it now snow white cakes of pulse; 
  Let loaves arise like dew; let it rain soup; 
  Let gravy roll down lumps of meat in the roads, 
  And cheese-cakes beg the wayfarer to eat them.

But Metagenes says this- 
  The river Crathis bears down unto us 
  Huge barley-cakes, self-kneaded and self-baked. 
  The other river, called the Sybaris, 
  Rolls on large waves of meat and sausages, 
  And boiled rays all wriggling the same way. 
  And all these lesser streamlets flow along 
  With roasted cuttlefish, and crabs, and lobsters; 
  And, on the other side, with rich black-puddings 
  And forced-meat stuffings; on the other side 
  Are herbs and lettuces, and fried bits of pastry. 
  [270] Above, fish cut in slices and self-boiled 
  Rush to the mouth; some fall before one's feet, 
  And dainty cheese-cakes swim around us everywhere. 
And I know too that the Thurio-Persae and the play of Nicophon were never exhibited at all; on which account I mentioned them last.

[99.] G   Democritus now having gone through this statement distinctly and intelligently, all the guests praised him; but Cynulcus said,- O messmates, I was exceedingly hungry, and Democritus has given me no unpleasant feast; carrying me across rivers of ambrosia and nectar. And I, having my mind watered by them, have now become still more exceedingly hungry, having hitherto swallowed nothing but words; so that now it is time to desist from this interminable discussion, and, as the Paeanian orator says [ Demosthenes, 3'33 ], to take some of these things, "which if they do not put strength into a man, at all events prevent his dying" - 
  For in an empty stomach there is no room 
  For love of beauteous objects, since fair Aphrodite 
  Is always hostile to a hungry man; 
as Achaeus says in Aethon, a satyric drama. And it was borrowing from him that the wise Euripides wrote - 
  Aphrodite abides in fullness, and avoids 
  The hungry stomach.

And Ulpianus, who was always fond of contradicting him, said in reply to this, - But still, 
  The market is of herbs and loaves too full.

But you, you dog, are always hungry, and do not allow us to partake of, or I should rather say devour, good discussion in sufficient plenty: for good and wise conversation is the food of the mind. And then turning to the servant he said,- O Leucus, if you have any remnants of bread, give them to the dogs. And Cynulcus rejoined,- If I had been invited here only to listen to discussions, I should have taken care to come when the forum was full; for that is the time which one of the wise men mentioned to me as the hour for declamations, and the common people on that account have called it ?????????: 
  But if we are to bathe and sup on words, 
  Then I my share contribute as a listener; 
as Menander says; on which account I give you leave, you glutton, to eat your fill of this kind of food - 
  But barley dearer is to hungry men 
  Than gold or Libyan ivory; 
as Achaeus the Eretrian says in his Cycnus.

[100.] And when Cynulcus had said this, he was on the point of rising up to depart; but turning round and seeing a quantity of fish, and a large provision of all sorts of other eatables being brought in, beating the pillow with his hand, he shouted out,- 
  Gird thyself up, O poverty, and bear 
  A little longer with these foolish babblers, 
  For copious food and hunger sharp subdues thee.

But I now, by reason of my needy condition, do not speak dithyrambic poems, as Socrates says, but even epic poems too. For, reciting poems is very hungry work. For, according to Ameipsias, who said in his Sling, where he utters a prediction about you, O Larensis, - 
  There are none of the rich men 
  In the least like you, by Hephaestus, 
  [271] Who enjoy a dainty table, 
  And who every day can eat 
  All delicacies that you wish.

For, as Heniochus says in his Busybody: 
  Now I see a thing beyond belief - 
  A prodigy; all sorts of kinds of fish 
  Sporting around this cape-tenches and char, 
  White and red mullet, rays, and perch, and eels, 
  Tunnies, and blacktails, and cuttlefish and pipe-fish, 
  And hake, and cod, and lobsters, crabs and scorpions.

I must, therefore, as the comic poet Metagenes says - 
  Without a sign his knife the hungry draws, 
  And asks no omen but his supper's cause - 
endure and listen to what more you have all got to say.

[101.] And when he was silent, Masurius said,- But since some things have still been left unsaid in our discussion on servants, I will myself also contribute some "melody on love" to the wise and much loved Democritus. Philippus of Theangela, in his treatise on the Carians and Leleges, having made mention of the Helots of the Lacedaemonians and of the Thessalian Penestae, says, "The Carians also, both in former times, and down to the present day, use the Leleges as slaves." But Phylarchus, in the sixth book of his History [ Fr_8 ], says that the Byzantines used the Bithynians in the same manner, just as the Lacedaemonians do the Helots. But respecting those who among the Lacedaemonians are called Epeunacti, and they also are slaves, Theopompus gives a very clear account in the thirty-second book of his History, speaking as follows:- "When many of the Lacedaemonians had been slain in the war against the Messenians, those who were left being afraid lest their enemies should become aware of their desolate condition, put some of the Helots into the beds of those who were dead; and afterwards they made those men citizens, and called them Epeunacti, because they had been put into the beds of those who were dead instead of them." And the same writer also tells us, in the thirty-third book of his History, that among the Sicyonians there are some slaves who are called Catonacophori, being very similar to the Epeunacti. And Menaechmus gives a similar account in his History of the affairs of Sicyon, and says that there are some slaves called Catonacophori, who very much resemble the Epeunacti. And again, Theopompus, in the second book of his Philippics, says that the Arcadians had three hundred thousand slaves, whom they called Prospelatae, like the Helots.

[102.] But the class called Mothaces among the Lacedaemonians are freemen, but still not citizens of Lacedaemon. And Phylarchus speaks of them thus, in the twenty-fifth book of his History [ Fr_43 ] - "But the Mothaces are foster-brothers of Lacedaemonian citizens. For each of the sons of the citizens has one or two, or even more foster-brothers, according as their circumstances admit. The Mothaces are freemen then, but still not Lacedaemonian citizens; but they share all the education which is given to the free citizens; and they say that Lysander, who defeated the Athenians in the naval battle, was one of that class, having been made a citizen on account of his pre-eminent valour." And Myron of Priene, in the second book of his history of the Affairs of Messene, says, "The Lacedaemonians often emancipated their slaves, and some of them when emancipated they called Aphetae, and some they called Adespoti, and some they called Erycteres, and others they called Desposionautae, whom they put on board their fleets, and some they called Neodamodes, but all these were different people from the Helots." [272] And Theopompus, in the seventh book of his history of the Affairs of Greece, speaking of the Helots that they were also called Heleatae, writes as follows:- "But the nation of the Helots is altogether a fierce and cruel race. For they are people who have been enslaved a long time ago by the Spartans, some of them being Messenians, and some Heleatae, who formerly dwelt in that part of Laconia called Helos ['marsh']."

[103.] But Timaeus of Tauromenium, forgetting himself, (and Polybius of Megalopolis attacks him for the assertion, in the twelfth book of his Histories [ 12.6 ],) says that it is not usual for the Greeks to possess slaves. But the same man, writing under the name of Epitimaeus, (and this is what Ister the pupil of Callimachus calls him in the treatise which he wrote against him,) says that Mnason the Phocian had more than a thousand slaves. And in the third book of his History, Epitimaeus said that the city of the Corinthians was so flourishing that it possessed four hundred and sixty thousand slaves. On which account I imagine it was that the Pythian priestess called them 'The People who measured with a choenix'.  # But Ctesicles, in the third book of his Chronicles, says that in the hundred and fifteenth Olympiad, there was an investigation at Athens conducted by Demetrius Phalereus into the number of the inhabitants of Attica, and the Athenians were found to amount to twenty-one thousand, and the metics to ten thousand, and the slaves to four hundred thousand. But Nicias the son of Niceratus, as that admirable writer Xenophon has said in his book on Revenues [ 4.14 ], when he had a thousand servants, let them out to Sosias the Thracian to work in the silver mines, on condition of his paying him an obol a day for every one of them. And Aristotle, in his history of the Constitution of the Aeginetans, says that the Aeginetans had four hundred and seventy thousand slaves. But Agatharchides the Cnidian, in the thirty-eighth book of his history of the Affairs of Europe, says that the Dardanians had great numbers of slaves, some of them having a thousand, and some even more; and that in time of peace they were all employed in the cultivation of the land; but that in time of war they were all divided into regiments, each set of slaves having their own master for their commander.

[104.] After all these statements, Larensis rose up and said,- But each of the Romans (and this is a fact with which you are well acquainted, my friend Masurius) had a great many slaves. For many of them had ten thousand or twenty thousand, or even a greater number, not for the purposes of income, as the rich Nicias had among the Greeks; but the greater part of the Romans when they go forth have a large retinue of slaves accompanying them. And out of the myriads of Attic slaves, the greater part worked in the mines, being kept in chains:  # at all events Poseidonius, whom you are often quoting, the philosopher I mean, says [ Fr_35 ] that once they revolted and put to death the guards of the mines; and that they seized on the Acropolis on Sunium, and that for a very long time they ravaged Attica. And this was the time when the second revolt of the slaves took place in Sicily. And there were many revolts of the slaves, and more than a million of slaves were destroyed in them. And Caecilius, the orator from Cale Acte, wrote a treatise on the Servile Wars. And Spartacus the gladiator, having escaped from Capua, a city of Italy, about the time of the Mithridatic war, prevailed on a great body of slaves to join him in the revolt, (and he himself was a slave, being a Thracian by birth,) and overran the whole of Italy for a considerable time, [273] great numbers of slaves thronging daily to his standard.  # And if he had not died in a battle fought against Licinius Crassus, he would have caused no ordinary trouble to our countrymen, as Eunus did in Sicily.

[105.] But the ancient Romans were prudent citizens, and eminent for all kinds of good qualities.  # Accordingly Scipio, surnamed Africanus, being sent out by the Senate to arrange all the kingdoms of the world, in order that they might be put into the hands of those to whom they properly belonged, took with him only five slaves, as we are informed by Polybius and Poseidonius. And when one of them died on the journey, he sent to his agents at home to bring him another instead of him, and to send him to him.  # And Julius Caesar, the first man who ever crossed over to the British isles with a thousand vessels, had with him only three servants altogether, as Cotta, who at that time acted as his lieutenant-general, relates in his treatise on the History and Constitution of the Romans, which is written in our national language. But Smindyrides of Sybaris was a very different sort of man, my Greek friends, who, when he went forth to marry Agariste, the daughter of Cleisthenes, carried his luxury and ostentation to such a height, that he took with him a thousand slaves, fishermen, bird-catchers, and cooks. But this man, wishing to display how magnificently he was used to live, according to the account given to us by Chamaeleon of Pontus, in his book on Pleasure, (but the same book is also attributed to Theophrastus,) said that for twenty years he had never seen the sun rise or set; and this he considered a great and marvellous proof of his wealth and happiness. For he, as it seems, used to go to bed early in the morning, and to get up in the evening, being in my opinion a miserable man in both particulars. But Hestiaeus of Pontus boasted, and it was an honourable boast, that he had never once seen the sun rise or set, because he had been at all times intent upon study, as we are told by Nicias of Nicaea in his Successions.

[106.] What then are we to think? Had not Scipio and Caesar any slaves? To be sure they had, but they abided by the laws of their country, and lived with moderation, preserving the habits sanctioned by the constitution. For it is the conduct of prudent men to abide by those ancient institutions under which they and their ancestors have lived, and made war upon and subdued the rest of the world; and yet, at the same time, if there were any useful or honourable institutions among the people whom they have subdued, those they take for their imitation at the same time that they take the prisoners. And this was the conduct of the Romans in olden time; for they, maintaining their national customs, at the same time introduced from the nations whom they had subdued every relic of desirable practices which they found, leaving what was useless to them, so that they should never be able to regain what they had lost. Accordingly they learnt from the Greeks the use of all machines and engines for conducting sieges; and with these engines they subdued the very people of whom they had learnt them. And when the Phoenicians had made many discoveries in nautical science, the Romans availed themselves of these very discoveries to subdue them.  And from the Etruscans they derived the practice of the entire army advancing to battle in close phalanx; and from the Samnites they learnt the use of the shield, and from the Iberians the use of the javelin. And learning different things from different people, they improved upon them: and imitating in everything the constitution of the Lacedaemonians, they preserved it better than the Lacedaemonians themselves; but now, having selected whatever was useful from the practices of their enemies, they have at the same time turned aside to imitate them in what is vicious and mischievous.

[107.] [274] For, as Poseidonius tells us, their national mode of life was originally temperate and simple, and they used everything which they possessed in an unpretending and unostentatious manner. Moreover they displayed wonderful piety towards the Deity, and great justice, and great care to behave equitably towards all men, and great diligence in cultivating the earth. And we may see this from the national sacrifices which we celebrate. For we proceed by ways regularly settled and defined. So that we bear regularly appointed offerings, and we utter regular petitions in our prayers, and we perform stated acts in all our sacred ceremonies. They are also simple and plain. And we do all this without being either clothed or attired as to our persons in any extraordinary manner, and without indulging in any extraordinary pomp when offering the first-fruits. But we wear simple garments and shoes, and on our heads we have rough hats made of the skins of sheep, and we carry vessels to minister in of earthenware and brass. And in these vessels we carry those meats and liquors which are procured with the least trouble, thinking it absurd to send offerings to the gods in accordance with our national customs, but to provide for ourselves according to foreign customs.  And, therefore, all the things which are expended upon ourselves are measured by their use; but what we offer to the gods are a sort of first-fruits of them.

[108.] Now Mucius Scaevola was one of the three men in Rome who were particular in their observance of the Lex Fannia; Quintus Aelius Tubero and Rutilius Rufus being the other two, the latter of whom is the man who wrote the History of his country.  # Which law enjoined men not to entertain more than three people besides those in the house; but on market-days a man might entertain five. And these market-days happened three times in the month. The law also forbade any one to spend in provisions more than two drachmae and a half. And they were allowed to spend fifteen talents a year on cured meat and whatever vegetables the earth produces, and on boiled pulse. But as this allowance was insufficient, men gradually (because those who transgressed the law and spent money lavishly raised the price of whatever was to be bought) advanced to a more liberal style of living without violating the law.  # For Tubero used to buy birds at a drachma apiece from the men who lived on his own farms. And Rutilius used to buy fish from his own slaves who worked as fishermen for three obols for a pound of fish; especially when he could get what is called the Thurian; and that is a part of the sea-dog which goes by that name.  # But Mucius agreed with those who were benefited by him to pay for all he bought at a similar valuation. Out of so many myriads of men then these were the only ones who kept the law with a due regard to their oaths; and who never received even the least present; but they gave large presents to others, and especially to those who had been brought up at the same school with them. For they all clung to the doctrines of the Stoic school.

[109.]  # But of the extravagance which prevails at the present time Lucullus was the first originator, he who subdued Mithridates, as Nicolaus the Peripatetic relates. For he, coming to Rome after the defeat of Mithridates, and also after that of Tigranes, the king of Armenia, and having triumphed, and having given in an account of his exploits in war, proceeded to an extravagant way of living from his former simplicity, and was the first teacher of luxury to the Romans, having amassed the wealth of the two before-mentioned kings.  # But the famous Cato, as Polybius tells us in the thirty-first book of his History [ 31.25 ], was very indignant, and cried out, [275] that some men had introduced foreign luxury into Rome, having bought an earthen jar of pickled fish from Pontus for three hundred drachmae, and some beautiful boys at a higher price than a man might buy a field.

"But in former times the inhabitants of Italy were so easily contented, that even now," says Poseidonius, "those who are in very easy circumstances are used to accustom their sons to drink as much water as possible, and to eat whatever they can get. And very often," says he, "the father or mother asks their son whether he chooses to have pears or nuts for his supper; and then he, eating some of these things, is contented and goes to bed."  But now, as Theopompus tells us in the first book of his history of the Actions of Philip, there is no one of those who are even tolerably well off who does not provide a most sumptuous table, and who has not cooks and a great many more attendants, and who does not spend more on his daily living than formerly men used to spend on their festivals and sacrifices.

And since now this present discussion has gone far enough, let us end this book at this point.

[8.] G   [369] First of all, there were turnips; and Apellas, in his treatise on the Cities in Peloponnese, says that turnips are called ???????? by the Lacedaemonians: and Nicander of Colophon, in his Dialects, says that among the Boeotians it is cabbages which are called ???????? and that turnips are called in Boeotia ??????????. But Amerias and Timachidas affirm that it is gourds which are called ??????????. And Speusippus, in the second book of his treatise on Things resembling one another, says- "The radish, the turnip, the rape, and the nasturtium all resemble each other." But Glaucus, in his Cookery Book, spells the word ????? (rape) with ? without the aspirate,- ?????. But these vegetables have nothing else like them, unless, indeed, it be the plant which we call bounias: but Theophrastus does not use the name of bounias, but calls it a sort of male turnip; and perhaps the plant which he means is the bounias. And Nicander, in his Georgics, mentions the bounias - 
  Sow turnips on a well-rolled field, that they 
  May grow as large as the flat dish that holds them. 
  *   *   *   * 
  For there are two kinds 
  Which from the radish spring: one long, one firm, 
  Both seen in well-tilled beds in kitchen gardens.

And the turnips which grow on the banks of the Cephisus are mentioned by Cratis, in his Orators, thus- 
  And wholly like the turnips of Cephisus.

But Theophrastus says that there are two kinds of turnips, the male and the female, and that they both come from the same seed; but Poseidonius the Stoic philosopher, in the twenty-seventh book of his Histories [ Fr_19 ], concerning Dalmatia, says that there are some turnips which grow without any cultivation, and also some carrots that grow wild. But Diphilus the physician, of Siphnos, says- "The turnip has attenuating properties, and is harsh and indigestible, and moreover is apt to cause flatulence: but the vegetable called bounias is superior to that; for it is sweeter in taste and more digestible, in addition to being wholesome for the stomach and nutritious. But the turnip," he says, "when roasted, is more easily digested, but in this state it attenuates the blood still more." This vegetable is mentioned by Eubulus, in his Ancylion, where he says- 
  I bring this turnip to be roasted now.

And Alexis, in his Enthusiast, says-- 
  I speak to Ptolemaeus, roasting slices of turnip.

But the turnip, when pickled, is more attenuating in its effects than when boiled, especially when it is pickled with mustard, as Diphilus says.

  * * * * *

[38.] G   [387] But Agatharchides of Cnidus, in the thirty-fourth book of his History of the Affairs of Europe, speaking of the river Phasis, writes as follows:- "But the great multitude of the birds called pheasants (????????) come for the sake of food to the places where the mouths of the rivers fall into the sea." #  And Callixeinus the Rhodian, in the fourth book of his Account of Alexandria, describing a procession which took place in Alexandria, when Ptolemy who was surnamed Philadelphus was king, mentions, as a very extraordinary circumstance connected with these birds- "Then there were brought on in cases parrots, and peacocks, and guinea-fowl, and pheasants, and an immense number of Ethiopian birds." And Artemidorus, the pupil of Aristophanes, in his book entitled The Glossary of Cookery, and Pamphilus the Alexandrian, in his treatise on Names and Words, represents Epaenetus as saying in his Cookery Book that the pheasant is also called ???????. But Ptolemy Euergetes, in the second book of his Commentaries, says that the pheasant is called ???????. Now this is what I am able to tell you about the pheasant, which I have seen brought up on your account, as if we all had fevers. But as for you, if you do not, according to your agreement, give me tomorrow what you have covenanted to, I do not say that I will prosecute you in the public courts for deceit, but I will send you away to live near the Phasis, as Polemon, the Describer of the World, wished to drown Ister the pupil of Callimachus, the historian, in the river of the same name.

  * * * * *

[49.] G   [393] And even swans in great plenty were not lacking at our banquets. And Aristotle speaks in the following manner of this bird- "The swan is a prolific bird, and a quarrelsome one. And, indeed, they are so fond of fighting that they often kill one another. And the swan will fight even the eagle; though he does not begin the battle himself. And they are tuneful birds, especially towards the time of their death. And they also cross the seas singing. And they are web-footed, and feed on herbage." But Alexander the Myndian says, that though he followed a great many swans when they were dying, he never heard one sing. And Hegesianax of Alexandria, who arranged the book of Cephalion, called the History of Troy, says that the Cycnus who fought with Achilles in single combat, was fed in Leucophrys by the bird of the same name, that is, by the swan. But Boius, or Boio, which Philochorus [ Fr_214 ] says was his proper name, in his book on the Origin of Birds, says that Cycnus was turned into a bird by Ares, and that when he came to the river Sybaris he was cooped with a crane. And he says, also, that the swan lines his nest with that particular grass which is called lygaea.

And concerning the crane (???????), Boius says that there was among the Pygmies a very well known woman whose name was Gerana. And she, being honoured as a god by her fellow-countrymen, thought lightly of those who were really gods, and especially of Hera and Artemis. And accordingly Hera, being indignant, changed her into an unsightly bird, and made her hostile to and hated by the Pygmies who had been used to honour her. And he says, also, that of her and Nicodamas was born the land tortoise. And as a general rule, the man who composed all these fables asserts that all the birds were formerly men.

  * * * * *

[63.] G   [400] But Hegesander of Delphi, in his Commentaries, says that in the reign of Antigonus Gonatas, there were such a number of hares in the island of Astypalaea, that the natives consulted the oracle on the subject. And the Pythia answered them that they ought to breed dogs, and hunt them; and so in one year there were caught more than six thousand. And all this immense number arose from a man of the island of Anaphe having put one pair of hares in the island. As also, on a previous occasion, when a certain Astypalean had let loose a pair of partridges in the island of Anaphe, there came to be such a number of partridges in Anaphe, that the inhabitants ran a risk of being driven out of the island by them. But originally Astypalaea had no hares at all, but only partridges. And the hare is a very prolific animal, as, Xenophon has told us, in his treatise on Hunting [ 5'13 ]; and Herodotus speaks of it in the following terms [ 3.108 ] - "Since the hare is hunted by everything - man, beast, and bird - it is on this account a very prolific animal; and it is the only animal known which is capable of superfetation. And it has in its womb at one time one litter with the fur on, and another bare, and another just formed, and a fourth only just conceived." And Polybius, in the twelfth book of his History [ 12.3'10 ], says that, there is another animal like the hare which is called the rabbit (?????????); and he writes as follows-" The animal called the rabbit, when seen at a distance, looks like a small hare; but when any one takes it in his hands, there is a great difference between them, both in appearance and taste: and it lives chiefly underground." [401] And Poseidonius the philosopher also mentions them in his History [ Fr_61 ]: "And we ourselves have seen a great many in our voyage from Dicaearcheia to Neapolis. For there is an island not far from the mainland, opposite the lower side of Dicaearcheia, inhabited by only a very scanty population, but having a great number of rabbits." And there is also a kind of hare called the Chelidonian hare, which is mentioned by Diphilus, or Calliades, in his play called Ignorance, in the following terms- 
  What is this? whence this hare who bears the name 
  Of Chelidonian? Is it grey hare soup, 
  Mimarcys called, so thick -with blood?

And Theopompus, in the twentieth book of his History, says that there are hares about Bisaltia which have two livers.

[64.] G   And when a wild boar was put upon the table, which was in no respect less than that noble Calydonian boar which has been so much celebrated,- I suggest to you now, said he, O my most philosophical and precise Ulpianus, to inquire who ever said that the Calydonian boar was a female, and that her meat was white. But he, without giving the matter any long consideration, but rather turning the question off, said- But it does seem to me, my friends, that if you are not yet satisfied, after having had such plenty of all these things, that you surpass every one who has ever been celebrated for his powers of eating,- and who those people are you can find out by inquiry. But it is more correct and more consistent with etymology to make the name ???, with a sigma; for the animal has its name from rushing (???????) and going on impetuously; but men have got a trick of pronouncing the word without the sigma, ??; and some people believe that it is called ???, by being softened from ???, as if it had its name from being a fit animal to sacrifice (?????). But now, if it seems good to you, answer me who ever uses the compound word like we do, calling the wild boar not ??? ??????, but ???????? At all events, Sophocles, in his Lovers of Achilles, has applied the word ??????? to a dog, as hunting the boar (??? ??? ??? ???????? ), where he says- 
  And you, Syagre, child of Pelion.

And in Herodotus we find Syagrus used as a proper name of a man who was a Lacedaemonian by birth, and who went on the embassy to Gelon the Syracusan, about forming an alliance against the Medes; which Herodotus mentions in the seventh book of his History [ 7.153 ]. And I am aware, too, that there was a general of the Aetolians named Syagrus, who is mentioned by Phylarchus, in the fourth book of his History [ Fr_5 ]. And Democritus said- You always, O Ulpianus, have got a habit of never taking anything that is set before you until you know whether the existing name of it was in use among the ancients. Accordingly you are running the risk, on account of all these inquiries of yours, (just like Philetas of Cos, who was always investigating all false arguments and erroneous uses of words,) of being starved to death, as he was. For he became very thin by reason of his devotion to these inquiries, and so died, as the inscription in front of his tomb shows- 
  Stranger, Philetas is my name, I lie 
  Slain by fallacious arguments, and cares 
  Protracted from the evening through the night.

[70.] G   [405] And to all this Aemilianus makes answer- 
  My friend, you've made a speech quite long enough 
  In praising your favourite art of cookery;- 
as Hegesippus says in his Brothers. Do you then- 
  Give us now something new to see beyond 
  Your predecessor's art, or plague us not; 
  But show me what you've got, and tell its name.

And he rejoins- 
  You look down on me, since I am a cook.

But perhaps- 
  What I have made by practising my art- 
according to the comic poet Demetrius, who, in his play entitled The Areopagite, has spoken as follows- 
  What I have made by practising my art 
  Is more than any actor ever has gained,- 
  This smoky art of mine is quite a kingdom. 
  I was a caper-pickler with Seleucus, 
  And at the court of the Sicilian king, 
  Agathocles, I was the very first 
  To introduce the royal dish of lentils. 
  My chief exploit I have not mentioned yet: 
  There was a famine, and a man named Lachares 
  Was giving an entertainment to his friends; 
  Whom I recovered with some caper-sauce.

#  Lachares stripped Athene naked, who caused him no inconvenience; but I will now strip you who are inconveniencing me, said Aemilianus, unless you show me what you have got with you. And he said at last, rather unwillingly, [406] I call this dish the Dish of Roses. And it is prepared in such a way, that you may not only have the ornament of a garland on your head, but also in yourself, and so feast your whole body with a luxurious banquet. Having pounded a quantity of the most fragrant roses in a mortar, I put in the brains of birds and pigs boiled and thoroughly cleansed of all the sinews, and also the yolks of eggs, and with them oil, and pickle-juice, and pepper, and wine. And having pounded all these things carefully together, I put them into a new dish, applying a gentle and steady fire to them. And while saying this, he uncovered the dish, and diffused such a sweet perfume over the whole party, that one of the guests present said with great truth [ Homer:Il_14'173 ] - 
  The winds perfumed the balmy gale convey 
  Through heaven, through earth, and all the aerial way; 
- so excessive was the fragrance which was diffused from the roses.

[4.] G   [412] But Theagenes of Thasos, the athlete, ate a bull single-handed, as Poseidippus tells us in his Epigrams: 
  And as I'd undertaken, I did eat 
  A Maeonian bull. My own poor native land 
  Of Thasos could not have purveyed a meal 
  Sufficient for the hunger of Theagenes. 
  I ate all I could get, then asked for more. 
  And, therefore, here you see, I stand in brass, 
  Holding my right hand forth; put something in it.

And Milon of Croton, as Theodorus of Hierapolis tells us in his book upon Games, ate twenty minae minae of meat, and an equal quantity of bread, and drank three choes of wine. And once at Olympia he took a four year old bull on his shoulders, and carried it all round the course, and after that he killed it and cut it up, and ate it all up by himself in one day. And Titormus the Aetolian had a contest with him as to which could eat an ox with the greatest speed, as Alexander the Aetolian relates. But Phylarchus, in the third book of his Histories [ Fr_3 ], says that Milon, while lying down before the altar of Zeus, ate a bull, on which account Dorieus the poet made the following epigram on him: 
  Milon could lift enormous weights from earth, 
  A heifer four years old, at Zeus' high feast, 
  [413] And on his shoulders the huge beast he bore, 
  As if it had been a young and little lamb, 
  All round the wondering crowd of standers by. 
  But he did still a greater feat than this, 
  Before the altar of Olympian Zeus; 
  For there he bore aloft an untamed bull 
  In the procession, then he cut it up, 
  And by himself ate every bit of it.

#  But Astyanax of Miletus, having gained the victory at Olympia three times in the pancratium, being once invited to supper by Ariobarzanes the Persian, when he had come, offered to eat everything that had been prepared for the whole party, and did eat it. And when, Theodorus relates, the Persian entreated him to do something suitable to his enormous strength, he broke off a large brazen ornament in the shape of a lentil from the couch and crushed it in his hand. And when he died, and when his body was burnt, one urn would not contain, his bones, and scarcely two could do so. And they say that the dinner which he ate by himself at Ariobarzanes' table bad been prepared for nine persons.

[5.] G   And there is nothing unnatural in such men as those being very voracious; for all the men who practise athletic exercises, learn with these gymnastic exercises also to eat a great deal. On which account Euripides says, in the first edition of his Autolycus- 
  For when there are ten thousand ills in Greece, 
  There's none that's worse than the whole race of athletes. 
  For, first of all, they learn not to live well, 
  Nor could they do so; for could any man 
  Being a slave to his own jaws and appetite 
  Acquire wealth beyond his father's riches! 
  How could a man like that increase his substance? 
  Nor yet can they put up with poverty, 
  Or ever accommodate themselves to fortune; 
  And so being unaccustomed to good habits, 
  They quickly fall into severe distress. 
  In youth they walk about in fine attire, 
  And think themselves a credit to the city; 
  But when old age in all its bitterness 
  Overtakes their steps, they roam about the streets, 
  Like ragged cloaks whose nap is all worn off. 
  And much I blame the present fashions, too, 
  Which now in Greece prevail; where many a feast 
  Is made to pay great honour to such men, 
  And to show false respect to vain amusements. 
  For though a man may wrestle well, or run, 
  Or throw a discus, or strike a heavy blow, 
  Still where's the good his country can expect 
  From all his victories and crowns and prizes? 
  Will they fight with their country's enemies 
  With discus in hand? Or will their speed assist 
  To make the hostile bands retreat before them ? 
  When men stand face to face with the hostile sword 
  They think no more of all these fooleries. 
  It were better to adorn good men and wise 
  With these victorious wreaths; they are the due 
  Of those who govern states with wisdom sound, 
  And practise justice, faith, and temperance; 
  Who by their prudent language ward off evils, 
  Banishing wars and factions. These are the men, 
  Who're not alone a grace and ornament 
  To their own land, but to the whole of Greece.

[6.] G   Now Euripides took all this from the Elegies of Xenophanes of Colophon, who has spoken in this way- 
  But if a man, in speed of foot victorious, 
  Or in the contests of the pentathlon, 
  Where is the sacred grove of Zeus, 
  Near to the sacred streams of Olympia; 
  [414] Or as a wrestler, or exchanging blows 
  And painful struggles as a hardy boxer, 
  Or in the terrible pancratium, 
  He surely is a noble citizen, 
  And well he does deserve the honours due 
  Of a front seat at games and festivals, 
  And at the public cost to be maintained; 
  And to receive a public gift of honour, 
  Which shall become an heirloom to his children. 
  And such shall be his honours, even if 
  He wins by horses, not by his own strength. 
  And still I think he does not equal me; 
  For wisdom far exceeds in real value 
  The bodily strength of man, or horses' speed; 
  But the mob judges of such things at random; 
  Though 'tis not right to prefer strength to sense: 
  For though a man may a good boxer be, 
  Or pentathlete, or unconquered wrestler, 
  Or if he vanquish all in speed of foot- 
  Which is the most important of all contests- 
  Still for all this his city will enjoy 
  No better laws through his great strength or speed; 
  And 'tis small cause for any lasting joy, 
  That one of all her citizens should gain 
  A prize on Pisa's banks: for such achievements 
  Fill not the country's granaries with corn.

And Xenophanes contends at great length, and with great earnestness and variety of argument, in favour of the superior advantage of his own wisdom, running down athletic exercises as useless and unprofitable. And Achaeus the Eretrian, speaking of the good constitution of the athletes, says- 
  For naked they did wave their glistening arms, 
  And move along exulting in their youth, 
  Their valiant shoulders swelling in their prime 
  Of health and strength; while they anoint with oil 
  Their chests and feet and limbs abundantly, 
  As being used to luxury at home.

[7.] G   But Heracleitus, in his Entertainer of Strangers, says that there was a woman named Helene, who ate more than any other woman ever did. And Poseidippus, in his Epigrams, says that Phyromachus was a great eater, on whom he wrote this epigram: 
  This lowly ditch now holds Phyromachus, 
  Who used to swallow everything he saw, 
  Like a fierce carrion crow who roams all night. 
  Now here he lies wrapped in a ragged cloak. 
  But, O Athenian, whoever you are, 
  Anoint this tomb and crown it with a wreath, 
  If ever in old times he feasted with you. 
  At last he came sans teeth, with eyes worn out, 
  And livid swollen eyelids; clothed in skins, 
  With but one single cruse, and that scarce full; 
  For from the Lenaean games he came, 
  Descending humbly to Calliope.

But Amarantus of Alexandria, in his treatise on the Stage, says that Herodorus, the Megarian trumpeter, was a man three cubits and a half in height; and that he had great strength in his chest, and that he could eat six choenixes of bread, and twenty pounds of meat, of whatever sort was provided for him, and that he could drink two choes of wine; and that he could play on two trumpets at once; and that it was his habit to sleep on only a lion's skin, and when playing on the trumpet he made a vast noise. [415] #  Accordingly, when Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, was besieging Argos, and when his troops could not bring the helepolis against the walls on account of its weight, he, giving the signal with his two trumpets at once, by the great volume of sound which he poured forth, instigated the soldiers to move forward the engine with great zeal and earnestness; and he gained the prize in all the games ten times; and he used to eat sitting down, as Nestor tells us in his Theatrical Reminiscences. #  And there was a woman too, who played on the trumpet, whose name was Aglais, the daughter of Megacles, who, in the first great procession which took place in Alexandria, played a processional piece of music ; having a head-dress of false hair on, and a crest upon her head, as Poseidippus proves by his epigrams on her. And she, too, could eat twelve pounds of meat and four choenixes of bread, and drink a chous of wine, at one sitting.

[8.] G   There was, besides, a man of the name of Lityerses, a bastard son of Midas, the king of Celaenae in Phrygia, a man of a savage and fierce aspect, and an enormous glutton; and he is mentioned by Sositheus the tragic poet, in his play called Daphnis or Lityersas; where he says- 
  He'll eat three asses' panniers, freight and all, 
  Three times in one brief day; and what he calls 
  A measure of wine is a ten-amphora cask; 
  And this he drinks all at a single draught.

And the man mentioned by Pherecrates, or Strattis, whichever was the author of the play called The Good Men, was much such another; the author says- 
  (A)   I scarcely in one day, unless I'm forced, 
  Can eat two medimni and a half of food. 
  (B)   A most unhappy man ! how have you lost 
  Your appetite, so as now to be content 
  With the scant rations of one ship of war?

And Xanthus, in his Account of Lydia, says that Cambles, who was the king of the Lydians, was a great eater and drinker, and also an exceeding epicure; and accordingly, that he one night cut up his own wife into joints and ate her; and then, in the morning, finding the hand of his wife still sticking in his mouth, he slew himself, as his act began to get notorious. And we have already mentioned Thys, the king of the Paphlagonians, saying that he too was a man of vast appetite, quoting Theopompus, who speaks of him in the thirty-fifth book of his History; and Archilochus, in his Tetrameters, has accused Charilas of the same fault, as the comic poets have attacked Cleonymus and Peisander. And Phoenicides mentions Chaerippus in his Phylarchus in the following terms- 
  And next to them I place Chaerippus third; 
  He, as you know, will without ceasing eat 
  As long as any one will give him food, 
  Or till he bursts,- such stowage vast has he, 
  Like any house.

[9.] G   #  And Nicolaus the Peripatetic, in the hundred and third book of his History, says that Mithridates, the king of Pontus, once proposed a contest in great eating and great drinking (and the prize was a talent of silver), and that he himself gained the victory in both; but he yielded the prize to the man who was judged to be second to him, namely, Calamodrys, the athlete of Cyzicus. And Timocreon the Rhodian, a poet, and an athlete who had gained the victory in the pentathlon, ate and drank a great deal, as the epigram on his tomb shows- 
  Much did I eat, much did I drink, and much 
  Did I abuse all men; now here I lie;- 
  My name Timocreon, my country Rhodes.

[416] And Thrasymachus of Chalcedon, in one his Prefaces, says that Timocreon came to the great king of Persia, and being entertained by him, did eat an immense quantity of food; and when the king asked him, What he would do on the strength of it? he said that he would beat a great many Persians; and the next day, having vanquished a great many, one after another, taking them one by one, after this, he beat the air with his hands; and when they asked him what he wanted, he said that he had all those blows left in him if any one was inclined to come on.  And Clearchus, in the fifth book of his Lives, says, that Cantibaris the Persian, whenever his jaws were weary with eating, had his slaves to pour food into his mouth, which he kept open as if they were pouring it into an empty vessel. But Hellanicus, in the first book of his Tale of Deucalion, says that Erysichthon, the son of Myrmidon, being a man perfectly insatiable in respect of food, was called Aethon. And Polemon, in the first book of his Treatise addressed to Timaeus, says that among the Sicilians there was a temple consecrated to gluttony, and an image of Demeter Sito; near which, also, there was a statue of Himalis, as there is at Delphi one of Hermuchus, and as at Scolus, in Boeotia, there are statues of Megalartus and Megalomazus.

  * * * * *

[13.] G   [418] And Hecataeus says that the Egyptians were great bread-eaters, eating loaves of rye, called ??????????, and bruising barley to extract a drink from it; and on this account Alexinus, in his treatise on Contentment, says that Bocchoris and his father Neochabis were contented with a moderate quantity of food. Pythagoras of Samos, also, used food in moderation, as Lycon of Iasus relates in his treatise on Pythagoras. But he did not abstain from animal food, as Aristoxenus tells us; and Apollodorus the mathematician says, that he even sacrificed a hecatomb when he found out that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares of the two sides containing it- 
  When the illustrious Pythagoras 
  Discovered that renowned problem which 
  He celebrated with a hecatomb.

[419] But Pythagoras was a very sparing drinker, and lived in a most frugal manner, so that he often contented himself with honey by itself. And nearly the same thing is told us of Aristeides, and of Epaminondas, and of Phocion, and of Phormion, the generals. #  But Manius Curius, the Roman general, lived on turnips all his life; and once, when the Sabines sent him a large sum of gold, he said he had no need of gold while he ate such food as that. And this story is recorded by Megacles in his treatise on Illustrious Men.

[14.] G   And there are many people who approve of moderate meals, as Alexis tells us in his Woman in Love- 
  But I am content with what is necessary, 
  And hate superfluous things; for in excess 
  There is not pleasure, but extravagance.

And in his Liar he says- 
  I hate excess; for those who practise it 
  Have only more expense, but not more pleasure.

And in his Foster Brothers he says- 
  How sweet all kinds of moderation are! 
  I now am going away, not empty, but 
  In a most comfortable state,- for wise 
  Mnesitheus tells us that 'tis always right 
  To avoid extravagance in everything.

And Ariston the philosopher, in the second book of his Amatory Similitudes, says that Polemon, the Academic philosopher, used to exhort those who were going to a supper, to consider how they might make their party pleasant, not only for the present evening, but also for the morrow. And Timotheus, the son of Conon, being once taken by Plato from a very sumptuous and princely entertainment to one held at the Academy, and being there feasted in a simple and scholar-like manner, said that those who supped with Plato would be well the next day also. But Hegesander, in his Commentaries, says that on the next day Timotheus, meeting with Plato, said, "You, O Plato, sup well, more with reference to the next day than to the present one!" But Pyrrhon of Elis, when on one occasion one of his acquaintances received him with a very sumptuous entertainment, as he himself relates, said, "I will for the future not come to you if you receive me in this manner; that I may avoid being grieved by seeing you go to a great expense for which there is no necessity, and that you, too, may not come to distress by being overwhelmed by such expenses; for it is much better for us to delight one another by our mutual companionship and conversation, than by the great variety of dishes which we set before one another, of which our servants consume the greater part."

[15.] G   #  But Antigonus of Carystus, in his Life of Menedemus, relating the way in which the banquets of that philosopher were managed, says, that he used to dine with one or two companions at most; and that all the rest of his guests used to come after they had supped. For in fact, Menedemus' supper and dinner were only one meal, and after that was over they called in all who chose to come; and if any of them, as would be the case, came before the time, they would walk up and down before the doors, and inquire of the servants who came out what was being now served up, and how far on the dinner had proceeded. And if they heard that it was only the vegetables or the cured fish that was being served up, they went away; but if they were told that the meat was put on the table, then they went into the room which had been prepared for that purpose. [420] And in the summer a rush mat was spread over each couch, and in the winter a fleece. But every one was expected to bring his own pillow; and the cup, which was brought round to each person, did not hold more than one cotyla. And the dessert was lupins or beans as a general rule; but sometimes some fruits, such as were in season, were brought in; in summer, pears or pomegranates; and in spring, pulse; and in winter, figs. And we have a witness as to these things, Lycophron of Chalcis, who wrote a satyric drama entitled Menedemus, in which Silenus says to the satyrs- 
  O cursed sons of most excellent Pan, 
  I, as you see, have quite a fancy for you: 
  For, by the gods I swear, that not in Caria, 
  Nor in fair Rhodes, nor royal Lydia, 
  Have I ever eaten so superb a supper; 
  Phoebus Apollo! what a feast it was.

And a little further on, he says- 
  And the boy brought us round a scanty cup 
  Of wine that might be worth five obols a bottle- 
  Awfully flat; and then that cursed thing, 
  That hang-dog lupin, danced upon the board, 
  A fitting meal for parasites and beggars.

And presently afterwards, he says that philosophical disquisitions were carried on during the entertainment- 
  And for dessert, 
  We had some learned conversation.

It is also related that those who met in this way very often kept on conversing to such a time that "the bird which calls the morn still caught them talking, and they were not yet satisfied."

[16.] G   # But Arcesilaus, when giving a supper to some people, when the bread fell short, and his slave made him a sign that there were no loaves left, burst out laughing, and clapped his hands; and said, "What a feast we have here, my friends! We forgot to buy loaves enough; run now, my boy:"- and this he said, laughing; and all the guests who were present burst out laughing, and great amusement and entertainment were excited, so that the very want of bread was a great seasoning to the feast. And at another time, Arcesilaus ordered Apelles, one of his friends, to strain some wine; and when he, not being used to doing so, shook some of the wine and spilt some, so that the wine appeared much thicker than usual, he laughed, and said, "But I told a man to strain the wine who has never seen anything good any more than I myself have; so do you now get up, Arideices; and do you go away and tap the casks that are outside." And this good-humour of his so pleased and excited the mirth of those present, that they were all filled with joy.

[17.] G   But those of the present day who give entertainments, especially the inhabitants of the beautiful Alexandria, cry out, and make a noise, and curse the cup-bearer, the steward, and cook; and the slaves are all crying, being beaten with fists and driven about in every direction. And not only do the guests who are invited sup with great discomfort and annoyance, but even if there is any sacrifice going on, the god himself would veil his face and go away, leaving not only the house, but even the entire city, in which such things take place. For it is absurd for a man, proclaiming that people should all confine themselves to words of good omen, to curse his wife and his children; and such a man as that would say to the guests [ Homer, Il_2'381 ] - 
  And now then let us hasten to the feast, 
  That we may plan the movements of the war;-

for such a man's house [ Sophocles, OedTyr_4 ] 
  Is redolent of frankincense, 
  [421] And paeans too, and groans at the same time.

Now, when all this had been said, one of the guests who were present said,- We ought, then, when we consider these things; to guard against indulging our appetites too much; 
  For a frugal dinner breeds no drunkenness, 
as Amphis says, in his Pan: nor does it produce insolence or insulting conduct; as Alexis testifies in his Odysseus Weaving, where he says- 
  For many a banquet which endures too long, 
  And many and daily feasts, are wont to cause 
  Insult and mockery; and those kind of jests 
  Give far more pain than they do raise amusement. 
  For such are the first ground of evil-speaking; 
  And if you once begin to attack your neighbour, 
  You quickly do receive back all you bring, 
  And then abuse and quarrels surely follow; 
  Then blows and drunken riot. For this is 
  The natural course of things, and needs no prophet.

[18.] G   And Mnesimachus, in his Philippus, on account of the immoderate indulgence in dinners of people of his time, introduces an entertainment which professes to be a preparation for war, and which really is what that admirable writer Xenophon [ Hell_3.4'17 ] calls a workshop of war. And he speaks thus-
  Know you now with what men you must fight? 
  With us, who sup upon well-sharpened swords, 
  And swallow lighted firebrands for dainties: 
  And then, for our dessert, our slaves bring in, 
  After the first course, Cretan bows and arrows; 
  And, instead of vetches, broken heads of spears, 
  And fragments of well-battered shields and breastplates; 
  And at our feet lie slings, and stones, and bows, 
  And on our heads are wreaths of catapults.

And Phoenix of Colophon says- 
  A cask of wine shall be our sword- a cup 
  Shall be our spear- our hair shall arrows be; 
  Goblets shall be our enemies- wine our horses- 
  Ointments and perfumes our war-cry fierce.

And in the Parasite, Alexis, speaking of some very voracious person, says- 
  And all the younger men do call him parasite, 
  Using a gentler name; but he cares not. 
  And Telephus in speechless silence sits, 
  Making but signs to those who ask him questions; 
  So that the inviter often offers prayers 
  To the great Samothracian gods of the sea, 
  To cease their blowing, and to grant a calm; 
  For that young man's a storm to all his friends.

And Diphilus, in his Heracles, speaking of some similar kind of person, says- 
  Do you not now behold me drunk and merry, 
  Well filled with wine, and all inflamed with anger? 
  Have not I just devoured a dozen cakes, 
  Every one larger than a good-sized shield?

On which account, Bion of Borysthenes said, cleverly enough, that " A man ought not to derive his pleasures from the table, but from meditation;" and Euripides says- 
  I pleased my palate with a frugal meal; 
signifying that the pleasure derived from eating and drinking is chiefly limited to the mouth. And Aeschylus, in his Phineus, says- 
  And many a most deceitful meal they snatched 
  Away from hungry jaws, in haste to enjoy 
  The first delight of the too eager palate.

And in his Stheneboea, Euripides speaks of frugality thus- 
  A life at sea is a much troubled life, 
  [422] Not reinforced with pleasures of the table, 
  But like a stable on the shore. The sea itself 
  Is a moist mother, not a nurse on land; 
  'Tis her we plough; from this our food, procured 
  With nets and traps, comes daily home to us.

[19.] G   For the belly is a great evil to man; concerning which Alexis speaks, in his Men Dying Together- 
  And hence you well may see how great an evil 
  The belly is to man; what lessons strange 
  It teaches, and what deeds it forces on us. 
  If there were any power which could take 
  This part alone from out our bodies, then 
  No one would any more do injury 
  Or insult to his neighbour. But from this 
  Flow all the ills that harass human life.

And Diphilus, in his Parasite, says- 
  Well did that wise Euripides oft speak, 
  And this does seem his wisest word of all- 
  "But want compels me and my wretched belly;" 
  For there is nought more wretched than the belly: 
  And into that you pour whatever you have, 
  Which you do not in any other vessel. 
  Loaves you perhaps may carry in a bag,- 
  Not soup, or else you'll spoil it. So again, 
  You put cakes in a basket, but not pulse; 
  And wine into a bladder, but not crabs: 
  But into this accursed belly, men 
  Put every sort of inconsistent thing. 
  I add no more; since it is plain enough 
  That all men's errors are produced by it.

# And Crates the Cynic, as Sosicrates tells us in his Successions, reproached Demetrius Phalereus for sending him a bag of bread with a flagon of wine.  "I wish," said he, "that the fountains bore bread." And Stilpon did not think himself guilty of intemperance when, having eaten garlic, he went to sleep in the temple of the Mother of the Gods; but all who eat of that food were forbidden even to enter into it. But when the goddess appeared to him in his sleep, and said, "O Stilpon, do you, though you are a philosopher, transgress the law?" he thought that he made answer to her (still being asleep), "Do you give me something better to eat, and I will not eat garlic."

  * * * * *

[25.] G   [425] And so great was the luxury of the ancients in respect of their sumptuous meals, that they not only had cupbearers, but also men whom they called oenoptae (inspectors of wines). At all events, the office of oenoptae is a regular office among the Athenians; and it is mentioned by Eupolis, in his play called The Cities, in the following lines- 
  And men whom heretofore you'd not have thought 
  Fit even to make oenoptae of, we now 
  See made our generals. But oh, city, city! 
  How much your fortune does outrun your sense.

And these oenoptae superintended the arrangement of banquets, taking care that the guests should drink on equal terms. But it was an office of no great dignity, as Philinus the orator tells us, in his debate on the Croconidae. And he tells us, too, that the oenoptae were three in number, and that they also provided the guests with lamps and wicks. And some people called them "eyes;" but among the Ephesians, the youths who acted as cupbearers at the festival of Poseidon were called "bulls," as Amerias tells us. And the people of the Hellespont call the cupbearer ?????????, or the pourer out; and they call carving, which we call ?????????, ??????????, as Demetrius of Scepsis tells us, in the twenty-sixth book of his Arrangement of the Trojan Forces. And some say that the nymph Harmonia acted as cupbearer to the gods; as Capito the epic poet relates (and he was a native of Alexandria by birth), in the second book of his Love Poems. But Alcaeus also represents Hermes as their cupbearer; as also does Sappho, who says- 
  And with ambrosia was a goblet mixed, 
  And Hermes poured it out to all the gods.

[26.] G   But the ancients used to call the men who discharged this office, heralds (???????). Homer says [ Il_3'245 ] - 
  Meanwhile the heralds through the crowded town 
  Bring the rich wine and destined victims down. 
  Idaeus' arms the golden goblets pressed, 
  Who thus the venerable king addressed.

And a few lines further on he says [ Il_3'268 ] - 
  On either side a sacred herald stands; 
  The wine they mix, and on each monarch's hands 
  Pour the full urn.

But Cleidemus says that the cooks used to be called heralds. And some people have represented Hebe as acting as cup-bearer to the gods, perhaps because their banquets were called Hebeteria. #  And Ptolemaeus, the son of Agesarchus, speaks of a damsel named Cleino as the cupbearer of Ptolemy the king, who was surnamed Philadelphus, mentioning her in the third book of his History of Philopator. But Polybius, in the fourteenth book of his History [ 14.11 ], adds that there are statues of her in Alexandria, in many parts of the city, clad in a tunic alone, holding a cup in her hand.

[40.] G   [432] And many used to put lumps of barley meal into their wine when they drank, a custom which Hegesander of Delphi mentions. Accordingly Epinicus, when Mnesiptolemus had given a recitation of his history, in which it was written how Seleucus had used meal in his wine, having written a drama entitled Mnesiptolemus, and having turned him into ridicule, as the comic poets do, and using his own words about that sort of drink, represents him as saying: 
  Once I beheld the noble king Seleucus, 
  One summer's day, drinking with mighty pleasure 
  Some wine with meal steeped in it. (So I took 
  A note of it, and showed it to a crowd, 
  Although it was an unimportant thing, 
  Yet still my genius could make it serious.) 
  He took some fine old Thasian wine, and then 
  Some of the liquor which the Attic bee 
  Distils who culls the sweets from every flower; 
  And that he mingled in a marble cup, 
  And mixed the liquor with Demeter's corn, 
  And took the draught, a respite from the heat.

And the same writer tells us that in the Therades islands men mash lentils and pease into meal, instead of ordinary corn, and put that into the wine, and that this drink is said to be better than that in which the meal is mixed.

  * * * * *

[50.] G   [437] But Antigonus of Carystus, in his essay on the Life of Dionysius of Heracleia, who was called the Turncoat (Metathemenos), says that Dionysius, when he was feasting with his slaves at the festival of the Pitchers, and was not able, by reason of his old age, to avail himself of the courtesan whom they brought him, turned round and said to those who were feasting with him [ Homer, Il_21'152 ] - 
  I cannot now, so let another take her.

But Dionysius, as Nicias of Nicaea tells us in his Successions, had been from the time he was a boy very wanton in the indulgence of his lustfulness; and he used to go to all the prostitutes promiscuously.  And once, when walking with some of his acquaintances, when he came near the house where the girls are kept, and where, having been there the day before, he had left some money owing, as he happened to have some with him then, he put out his hand and paid it in the presence of all of them. [438] And Anacharsis the Scythian, when a prize for drinking was proposed at the table of Periander, demanded the prize, because he was the first man to be drunk of all the guests who were present; as if to get to the end were the goal to be aimed at, and the victory to be achieved in drinking as in running a race. But Lacydes and Timon the philosophers, being invited to an entertainment which was to last two days, by one of their friends, and wishing to adapt themselves to the rest of the guests, drank with great eagerness. And accordingly in the first day, Lacydes went away first, as soon as he was quite satiated with drink. And Timon, seeing him as he was departing, said [ Homer, Il_22'393 ] - 
  Now have we gained immortal praise and fame, 
  Since we have slain great Hector. . .

But on the next day Timon went away first because he could not drink up the goblet in which he had been pledged, and Lacydes seeing him departing, said [ Homer, Il_6'127 ] - 
  Wretched are they who dare encounter me.

[51.] G   And Herodotus, in his second book [ 2.133 ], relates that Mycerinus the Egyptian, having been told by the soothsayers that he was fated to live but a short time, used to light a great number of lamps when night arrived, and spend all his time in drinking and luxury, relaxing neither by day nor by night; and when he withdrew into the marshes and into the groves, or wherever he heard that there were meetings of young people to amuse themselves, he always got drunk. And Herodotus tells us that Amasis also, who was another of the Egyptian kings, was a very hard drinker indeed. And Hermeias of Methymna, in the third book of his History of Sicily, says that Nicoteles the Corinthian was a man greatly addicted to drinking. And Phaenias of Eresus, in the book entitled, The Slaying of Tyrants out of Revenge, says that Scopas the son of Creon, and the grandson of the former Scopas, was throughout his whole life very fond of drinking; and that he used to return from banquets at which he had been present, sitting on a throne, and carried by four bearers, and in that way he used to enter his house. # And Phylarchus, in the sixth book of his Histories [ Fr_6 ], says that Antiochus the king was a man very fond of wine; and that he used to get drunk, and then go to sleep for a long time, and then, as evening came on, he would wake up, and drink again. And it was very seldom, says he, that he transacted the affairs of his kingdom when he was sober, but much more frequently when he was drunk; on which account there were two men about him who managed all the real business of the state as they pleased, namely Aristus and Themison, Cyprians by birth, and brothers; and they were both on terms of the greatest intimacy with Antiochus.

[52.] G   #  And Antiochus the king, who was surnamed Epiphanes, was also a great drinker,- the one, I mean, who had been a hostage among the Romans, whom Ptolemy Euergetes mentions in the third book of his Commentaries, and also in the fifth; saying that he turned to Indian revellings and drunkenness, and spent a vast quantity of money in those practices; and for the rest of the money which he had at hand, he spent a part of it in his daily revels, and the rest he would scatter about, standing in the public streets, and saying, "Let whoever chance gives it to, take it:" and then, throwing the money about, he would depart. And very often, having a plaited garland of roses on his head, and wearing a golden embroidered robe, he would walk about alone, having stones under his arm, which he would throw at those of his friends who were following him. And he used to bathe also in the public baths, anointed all over with perfumes; and, on one occasion, some private individual, seeing him, said, "You are a happy man, O king; you smell in a most costly manner:" and he, being much pleased, said, "I will give you as much as you can desire of this perfume." And so he ordered an ewer containing more than two choes of thick perfumed unguent to be poured over his head; so that the multitude of the poorer people who were about all collected to gather up what was spilt; and, as the place was made very slippery by it, Antiochus himself slipped and fell, laughing a great deal, and most of the bathers did the same.

[439] But Polybius, in the twenty-sixth book of his Histories [ 26.1 ], calls this man Epimanes (mad), and not Epiphanes (illustrious), on account of his actions.- "For he not only used to go to entertainments of the common citizens, but he also would drink with any strangers who happened to be sojourning in the city, and even with those of the meanest class. And if," says Polybius, "he heard that any of the younger men were making a feast anywhere whatever, he would come with an earthen bowl, and with music, so that the greater part of the feasters fled away alarmed at his unexpected appearance. And very often he would put off his royal robes, and take a common cloak, and in that dress go round the market."

[53.] G   #  And in the thirty-first book of his Histories [ 30.25 ], the same Polybius tells us "that when Antiochus was celebrating some public games at Antioch, he invited all the Greeks and any of the multitude who chose to come to the spectacle. And when a great many people came, he anointed them all in the gymnnasia with ointment of saffron, and cinnamon, and nard, and amaracus, and lilies, out of golden vessels: and then, inviting them all to a feast, he filled sometimes a thousand and sometimes fifteen hundred triclinia with the most expensive preparations; and he himself personally attended to waiting on the guests. For, standing at the entrance, he introduced some, and others he placed upon the couches; and he himself marshalled the servants who brought in the different courses; and, walking about among the guests, at times he sat down in one place, and at times he lay down in another. And sometimes he would put down what he was eating, and at other times he would lay down his cup, and jump up, and change his place, and go all round the party, standing up himself, and pledging different people at different times; and then, mingling with the musicians, he would be brought in by the actors, entirely covered up, and laid down on the ground, as if he had been one of the actors himself; and then, when the music gave the signal, the king would leap up, and dance and sport among the actors, so that they were all ashamed. To such absurdities does a want of education, when joined with drunkenness, reduce miserable men." #  And his namesake, the Antiochus who carried on war in Media against Arsaces, was very fond of drinking; as Poseidonius of Apameia relates in the sixteenth book of his History [ Fr_11 ]. Accordingly, when he was slain, he says that Arsaces, when he buried him, said- "Your courage and your drunkenness have ruined you, O Antiochus; for you hoped that, in your great cups, you would be able to drink up the kingdom of Arsaces."

[54.] G   #  But the Antiochus who was surnamed the Great, who was subdued by the Romans (as Polybius relates in his twentieth book [ 20.8 ]), having arrived at Chalcis, in Euboea, celebrated a marriage when he was fifty years of age; and after he had undertaken two most enormous and important affairs, namely, the liberation of the Greeks (as he himself professed) and the war against the Romans. At all events, he, being smitten with love for a girl of Chalcis, was very anxious to marry her at the very time that he was engaged in this war, being a man very fond of drinking and delighting in drunkenness. And she was the daughter of Cleophanes, one of the nobles, and superior to all the maidens of her country in beauty. Accordingly, he celebrated his marriage in Chalcis, and remained there all the winter, not once giving the smallest thought to the important affairs which he had in hand. And he gave the girl the name of Euboea. Accordingly, being defeated in the war, he fled to Ephesus, with his newly-married bride. [440] And in the second book [ 2.4 ], the same Polybius relates that Agron, the king of the Illyrians, being delighted at having gained a victory over the haughty Aetolians, being a man much addicted to drinking, and to drunkenness, and banqueting, fell ill of a pleurisy, and died. #  And the same historian says, in his twenty-ninth book [ 29.13 ], that Genthion, the king of the Illyrians, on account of his great fondness for drinking, did a great many intemperate things during his life, being incessantly drunk, both night and day; and having murdered Pleuratus, his brother, who was about to marry the daughter of Menunius, he married the girl himself, and treated his subjects with great cruelty. And he says, in the thirty-third book of his History [ 33.19 ], that Demetrius, when he fled after having been a hostage at Rome, and became king of the Syrians, became a great drinker, and was drunk the greater part of the day. #  And he also, in his thirty-second book [ 32.11 ], says that Orophernes, who was for a short time king of Cappadocia, disregarded all the customs of his country, and introduced the artificial luxury of the Ionians.

[55.] G   On which account, that most divine of writers, Plato, lays down admirable laws in his second book [ Laws_2.666'a ] - "That boys, till they are eighteen years of age, should absolutely never taste wine at all; for that it is not well to heap fire on fire: that men up to thirty years of age may drink wine in moderation; and that the young man should wholly abstain from much wine and from drunkenness. But that a man, when he arrives at forty years of age, may feast in large banquets, and invoke the other gods, and especially Dionysus, to the feasts and amusements of the older men; since he it is who has given men this means of indulgence, as an ally against the austerity of old age, for which wine was the best medicine; so that, owing to it, we grow young again, and forget our moroseness." And then he proceeds to say- "But there is a report and story told that this god was once deprived of his mind and senses by his mother-in-law, Hera; on which account he sent Bacchic frenzy, and all sorts of frantic rage, among men, out of revenge for the treatment which he had experienced; on which account also he gave wine to men."

[56.] G   But Phalaecus, in his Epigrams, makes mention of a woman, whose name was Cleo, as having been a very hard drinker- 
  Cleo bestowed this gift on Dionysus, 
  The tunic, fringed with gold and saffron hues, 
  Which long she wore herself; so great she was 
  At feasts and revelry: there was no man 
  Who could at all contend with her in drinking.

And it is a well-known fact that all the race of women is fond of drinking. And it was not without some wit that Xenarchus introduces, in his Pentathlon, a woman swearing this most horrible oath:- 
  May it be granted me to pass from life 
  Drinking abundant draughts of wine, while you, 
  My darling daughter, live and prosper here.

But among the Romans, as Polybius says, in his sixth book [ 6.11a'4 ], it was forbidden to women to drink wine at all. However, they drink what is called passum; and that is made of raisins, and when drank is very like the sweet wines of Aegosthena and Crete, on which account men use it when oppressed by excessive thirst. And it is impossible for a woman to drink wine without being detected: for, first of all, she has not the key of the cellar; and, in the next place, she is bound to kiss her relations, and those of her husband, down to cousins, and to do this every day when she first sees them; and besides this, she is forced to be on her best behaviour, as it is quite uncertain whom she may chance to meet; [441] for if she has merely tasted wine, it needs no informer, but is sure to betray itself."

And Alcimus the Sicilian, in that book of his which is entitled the Italian History, says that all the women in Italy avoid drinking wine on this account: "When Heracles was in the district of Croton, he one day was very thirsty, and came to a certain house by the wayside and asked for something to drink; and it happened that the wife of the master of the house had secretly opened a cask of wine, and therefore she said to her husband that it would be a shameful thing for him to open this cask for a stranger; and so she told him to give Heracles some water. But Heracles, who was standing at the door, and heard all this, praised her husband very much, but advised him to go indoors himself and look at the cask. And when he had gone in, he found that the cask had become petrified. And this fact is proved by the conduct of the women of the country, among whom it is reckoned disgraceful, to this day, to drink wine, on account of the above-mentioned reason."

[57.] G   And what sort of women those among the Greeks are who get drunk, Antiphanes tells us, in his Woman Hit by a Javelin; where he says- 
  I have a neighbour who sells wine, 
  And he, whenever I arrive, being thirsty, 
  Is the only man who knows the proper way 
  In which to mix my wine; and makes it not 
  Too full of water, nor too strong and heady: 
  I recollect that once when I was drinking .....

And, in his Woman Initiated, (and it is women who are conversing,) he writes- 
  (A)   Would you now like, my dearest friend, to drink? 
  (B)   No doubt I should. 
  (A)   Well come, then, take a cup; 
  For they do say the first three cups one takes 
  All tend to the honour of the heavenly gods.

And Alexis, in his Female Dancer, says- 
  (A)   But women are quite sure to be content 
  If they have only wine enough to drink. 
  (B)   But, by the heavenly twins, we now shall have 
  As much as we can wish; and it shall be 
  Sweet, and not griping,- rich, well-seasoned wine, 
  Exceeding old. 
  (A)   I like this aged sphinx; 
  For hear how now she talks to me in riddles. 
And so on. And, in his Zeus the Mourner, he mentions a certain woman named Zopyra, and says- 
  Zopyra, that wine-cask.

Antiphanes, in his The Bacchants- 
  But since this now is not the case, I'm sure 
  He is a wretched man who ever marries 
  Except among the Scythians; for their country 
  Is the sole land which does not bear the vine.

And Xenarchus, in his Pentathlon, says- 
  I write a woman's oath in mighty wine.

[58.] G   Platon, in his Phaon, relating how many things happen to women because of wine, says- 
  Come now, ye women, long ago have I 
  Prayed that this wine may thus become your folly; 
  For you don't think, as the old proverb goes, 
  That there is any wisdom at a vintner's. 
  For if you now desire to see Phaon, 
  You first must all these solemn rites perform. 
  First, as the nurse of youths, I must receive 
  A vigorous cheesecake, and a pregnant mealcake, 
  And sixteen thrushes whole, well smeared with honey, 
  Twelve hares, all taken when the moon was full; 
  But all the other things may be got cheaply. 
  Now listen. Three half-measures of fine onions; 
  These for Orthannes. For Conisalus 
  And his two mates, a plate of myrtleberries, 
  [442] Plucked with the hand: for the great Gods above 
  Dislike the smell of lamps. You must offer 
  (?) A dark-coloured raisin for the dogs and huntsmen. 
  A drachma for Lordon; for Cybdasus, 
  Three obols; for the mighty hero Celes, 
  Some hides and incense. Now if you bring 
  These things, you'll certainly obtain admittance; 
  But if you don't, you'll knock in vain, and long 
  In vain to enter, and get nothing by it.

And Axionicus says, in his Philinna- 
  Just trust a woman to drink no water.

[59.] G   And whole nations are mentioned as addicted to drunkenness. Accordingly, Baeton, the measurer of distances for Alexander, in his book which is entitled Stations of the March of Alexander, and Amyntas also, in his Stations, says that the nation of the Tapyri is so fond of wine that they never use any other unguent than that. And Ctesias tells the same story, in his book Concerning the Revenues in Asia. And he says that they are a most just people. And Harmodius of Lepreum, in his treatise on the Laws in force among the people of Phigaleia, says that the Phigaleians are addicted to drinking, being neighbours of the Messenians, and being also a people much accustomed to travelling. And Phylarchus, in his sixth book [ Fr_7 ], says that the Byzantians are so exceedingly fond of wine, that they live in the wine-shops and let out their own houses and their wives also to strangers: and that they cannot bear to hear the sound of a trumpet even in their sleep. On which account once, when they were attacked by the enemy, and could not endure the labour of defending their walls, Leonidas, their general, ordered the innkeepers' booths to be erected as tents upon the walls, and even then it was with difficulty that they were stopped from deserting, as Damon tells us, in his book on Byzantium. But Menander, in his play called the Woman carrying the Peplos of Athene, or the Female Flute-player, says- 
  Byzantium makes all the merchants drunk. 
  On your account we drank the whole night long, 
  And right strong wine too, as it seems to me,- 
  At least I got up with four heads, I think.

And the Argives too are ridiculed by the comic poets as addicted to drunkenness; and so are the Tirynthians by Ephippus, in his Busiris. And he introduces Heracles as saying- 
  (A)   For how in the name of all the gods at once, 
  Do you not know me, the Tirynthian Argive? 
  That race fights all its battles when it's drunk. 
  (B)   And that is why they always run away.

And Eubulus, in his Man Glued, says that the Milesians are very insolent when they are drunk. And Polemon, in his treatise on the Inscriptions to be found in Cities, speaking of the Eleans, produces this epigram:- 
  Elis is always drunk, and always lying: 
  As is each single house, so is the city.

  * * * * *

[64.] G   [445] When Ulpianus had heard all this he said,- Tell me, my good Pontianus, says he, in what author does the word ???????? occur? And he replied- 
  You will undo me with your questions 
(as the excellent Agathon says)- 
  .... and your new fashion, 
  Always talking at an unseasonable time.

But since it is decided that we are to be responsible to you for every word, Antiphanes, in his Lydian, has said- 
  A Colchian man drunken and quarrelsome (????????).

But you are not yet satisfied about your ????????, and drunkards; #  nor do you consider that Eumenes the king of Pergamum, the nephew of Philetaerus, who had formerly been king of Pergamum, died of drunkenness, as Ctesicles relates, in the third book of his Chronicles. #  But, however, Perseus, whose power was put down by the Romans, did not die in that way; for he did not imitate his father Philippus in anything; for he was not eager about women, nor was he fond of wine; but when at a feast he was not only moderate himself, but all his friends who were with him were so too, as Polybius relates, in his twenty-sixth book. But you, O Ulpianus, are a most immoderate drinker yourself (????????????), as Timon of Phlius calls it. For so he called those men who drink a great quantity of unmixed wine, in the second book of his Silli- 
  Or that great ox-goad, harder than Lycurgus', 
  Who smote the ???????????? of Dionysus, 
  And threw their cups and brimming ladles down.

For I do not call you simply ???????, or fond of drinking; and this last is a word which Alcaeus has used, in his Ganymedes. And that a habit of getting drunk deceives our eyesight, Anacharsis has shown plainly enough, in what he says where he shows that mistaken opinions are taken up by drunken men. For a fellow-drinker of his once, seeing his wife at a banquet, said, "Anacharsis, you have married an ugly woman." And he replied, "Indeed I think so too, but however now, give me, O boy, a cup of stronger wine, that I may make her out beautiful."

[4.] G   [412] But Theagenes of Thasos, the athlete, ate a bull single-handed, as Poseidippus tells us in his Epigrams: 
  And as I'd undertaken, I did eat 
  A Maeonian bull. My own poor native land 
  Of Thasos could not have purveyed a meal 
  Sufficient for the hunger of Theagenes. 
  I ate all I could get, then asked for more. 
  And, therefore, here you see, I stand in brass, 
  Holding my right hand forth; put something in it.

And Milon of Croton, as Theodorus of Hierapolis tells us in his book upon Games, ate twenty minae minae of meat, and an equal quantity of bread, and drank three choes of wine. And once at Olympia he took a four year old bull on his shoulders, and carried it all round the course, and after that he killed it and cut it up, and ate it all up by himself in one day. And Titormus the Aetolian had a contest with him as to which could eat an ox with the greatest speed, as Alexander the Aetolian relates. But Phylarchus, in the third book of his Histories [ Fr_3 ], says that Milon, while lying down before the altar of Zeus, ate a bull, on which account Dorieus the poet made the following epigram on him: 
  Milon could lift enormous weights from earth, 
  A heifer four years old, at Zeus' high feast, 
  [413] And on his shoulders the huge beast he bore, 
  As if it had been a young and little lamb, 
  All round the wondering crowd of standers by. 
  But he did still a greater feat than this, 
  Before the altar of Olympian Zeus; 
  For there he bore aloft an untamed bull 
  In the procession, then he cut it up, 
  And by himself ate every bit of it.

#  But Astyanax of Miletus, having gained the victory at Olympia three times in the pancratium, being once invited to supper by Ariobarzanes the Persian, when he had come, offered to eat everything that had been prepared for the whole party, and did eat it. And when, Theodorus relates, the Persian entreated him to do something suitable to his enormous strength, he broke off a large brazen ornament in the shape of a lentil from the couch and crushed it in his hand. And when he died, and when his body was burnt, one urn would not contain, his bones, and scarcely two could do so. And they say that the dinner which he ate by himself at Ariobarzanes' table bad been prepared for nine persons.

[5.] G   And there is nothing unnatural in such men as those being very voracious; for all the men who practise athletic exercises, learn with these gymnastic exercises also to eat a great deal. On which account Euripides says, in the first edition of his Autolycus- 
  For when there are ten thousand ills in Greece, 
  There's none that's worse than the whole race of athletes. 
  For, first of all, they learn not to live well, 
  Nor could they do so; for could any man 
  Being a slave to his own jaws and appetite 
  Acquire wealth beyond his father's riches! 
  How could a man like that increase his substance? 
  Nor yet can they put up with poverty, 
  Or ever accommodate themselves to fortune; 
  And so being unaccustomed to good habits, 
  They quickly fall into severe distress. 
  In youth they walk about in fine attire, 
  And think themselves a credit to the city; 
  But when old age in all its bitterness 
  Overtakes their steps, they roam about the streets, 
  Like ragged cloaks whose nap is all worn off. 
  And much I blame the present fashions, too, 
  Which now in Greece prevail; where many a feast 
  Is made to pay great honour to such men, 
  And to show false respect to vain amusements. 
  For though a man may wrestle well, or run, 
  Or throw a discus, or strike a heavy blow, 
  Still where's the good his country can expect 
  From all his victories and crowns and prizes? 
  Will they fight with their country's enemies 
  With discus in hand? Or will their speed assist 
  To make the hostile bands retreat before them ? 
  When men stand face to face with the hostile sword 
  They think no more of all these fooleries. 
  It were better to adorn good men and wise 
  With these victorious wreaths; they are the due 
  Of those who govern states with wisdom sound, 
  And practise justice, faith, and temperance; 
  Who by their prudent language ward off evils, 
  Banishing wars and factions. These are the men, 
  Who're not alone a grace and ornament 
  To their own land, but to the whole of Greece.

[6.] G   Now Euripides took all this from the Elegies of Xenophanes of Colophon, who has spoken in this way- 
  But if a man, in speed of foot victorious, 
  Or in the contests of the pentathlon, 
  Where is the sacred grove of Zeus, 
  Near to the sacred streams of Olympia; 
  [414] Or as a wrestler, or exchanging blows 
  And painful struggles as a hardy boxer, 
  Or in the terrible pancratium, 
  He surely is a noble citizen, 
  And well he does deserve the honours due 
  Of a front seat at games and festivals, 
  And at the public cost to be maintained; 
  And to receive a public gift of honour, 
  Which shall become an heirloom to his children. 
  And such shall be his honours, even if 
  He wins by horses, not by his own strength. 
  And still I think he does not equal me; 
  For wisdom far exceeds in real value 
  The bodily strength of man, or horses' speed; 
  But the mob judges of such things at random; 
  Though 'tis not right to prefer strength to sense: 
  For though a man may a good boxer be, 
  Or pentathlete, or unconquered wrestler, 
  Or if he vanquish all in speed of foot- 
  Which is the most important of all contests- 
  Still for all this his city will enjoy 
  No better laws through his great strength or speed; 
  And 'tis small cause for any lasting joy, 
  That one of all her citizens should gain 
  A prize on Pisa's banks: for such achievements 
  Fill not the country's granaries with corn.

And Xenophanes contends at great length, and with great earnestness and variety of argument, in favour of the superior advantage of his own wisdom, running down athletic exercises as useless and unprofitable. And Achaeus the Eretrian, speaking of the good constitution of the athletes, says- 
  For naked they did wave their glistening arms, 
  And move along exulting in their youth, 
  Their valiant shoulders swelling in their prime 
  Of health and strength; while they anoint with oil 
  Their chests and feet and limbs abundantly, 
  As being used to luxury at home.

[7.] G   But Heracleitus, in his Entertainer of Strangers, says that there was a woman named Helene, who ate more than any other woman ever did. And Poseidippus, in his Epigrams, says that Phyromachus was a great eater, on whom he wrote this epigram: 
  This lowly ditch now holds Phyromachus, 
  Who used to swallow everything he saw, 
  Like a fierce carrion crow who roams all night. 
  Now here he lies wrapped in a ragged cloak. 
  But, O Athenian, whoever you are, 
  Anoint this tomb and crown it with a wreath, 
  If ever in old times he feasted with you. 
  At last he came sans teeth, with eyes worn out, 
  And livid swollen eyelids; clothed in skins, 
  With but one single cruse, and that scarce full; 
  For from the Lenaean games he came, 
  Descending humbly to Calliope.

But Amarantus of Alexandria, in his treatise on the Stage, says that Herodorus, the Megarian trumpeter, was a man three cubits and a half in height; and that he had great strength in his chest, and that he could eat six choenixes of bread, and twenty pounds of meat, of whatever sort was provided for him, and that he could drink two choes of wine; and that he could play on two trumpets at once; and that it was his habit to sleep on only a lion's skin, and when playing on the trumpet he made a vast noise. [415] #  Accordingly, when Demetrius, the son of Antigonus, was besieging Argos, and when his troops could not bring the helepolis against the walls on account of its weight, he, giving the signal with his two trumpets at once, by the great volume of sound which he poured forth, instigated the soldiers to move forward the engine with great zeal and earnestness; and he gained the prize in all the games ten times; and he used to eat sitting down, as Nestor tells us in his Theatrical Reminiscences. #  And there was a woman too, who played on the trumpet, whose name was Aglais, the daughter of Megacles, who, in the first great procession which took place in Alexandria, played a processional piece of music ; having a head-dress of false hair on, and a crest upon her head, as Poseidippus proves by his epigrams on her. And she, too, could eat twelve pounds of meat and four choenixes of bread, and drink a chous of wine, at one sitting.

[8.] G   There was, besides, a man of the name of Lityerses, a bastard son of Midas, the king of Celaenae in Phrygia, a man of a savage and fierce aspect, and an enormous glutton; and he is mentioned by Sositheus the tragic poet, in his play called Daphnis or Lityersas; where he says- 
  He'll eat three asses' panniers, freight and all, 
  Three times in one brief day; and what he calls 
  A measure of wine is a ten-amphora cask; 
  And this he drinks all at a single draught.

And the man mentioned by Pherecrates, or Strattis, whichever was the author of the play called The Good Men, was much such another; the author says- 
  (A)   I scarcely in one day, unless I'm forced, 
  Can eat two medimni and a half of food. 
  (B)   A most unhappy man ! how have you lost 
  Your appetite, so as now to be content 
  With the scant rations of one ship of war?

And Xanthus, in his Account of Lydia, says that Cambles, who was the king of the Lydians, was a great eater and drinker, and also an exceeding epicure; and accordingly, that he one night cut up his own wife into joints and ate her; and then, in the morning, finding the hand of his wife still sticking in his mouth, he slew himself, as his act began to get notorious. And we have already mentioned Thys, the king of the Paphlagonians, saying that he too was a man of vast appetite, quoting Theopompus, who speaks of him in the thirty-fifth book of his History; and Archilochus, in his Tetrameters, has accused Charilas of the same fault, as the comic poets have attacked Cleonymus and Peisander. And Phoenicides mentions Chaerippus in his Phylarchus in the following terms- 
  And next to them I place Chaerippus third; 
  He, as you know, will without ceasing eat 
  As long as any one will give him food, 
  Or till he bursts,- such stowage vast has he, 
  Like any house.

[9.] G   #  And Nicolaus the Peripatetic, in the hundred and third book of his History, says that Mithridates, the king of Pontus, once proposed a contest in great eating and great drinking (and the prize was a talent of silver), and that he himself gained the victory in both; but he yielded the prize to the man who was judged to be second to him, namely, Calamodrys, the athlete of Cyzicus. And Timocreon the Rhodian, a poet, and an athlete who had gained the victory in the pentathlon, ate and drank a great deal, as the epigram on his tomb shows- 
  Much did I eat, much did I drink, and much 
  Did I abuse all men; now here I lie;- 
  My name Timocreon, my country Rhodes.

[416] And Thrasymachus of Chalcedon, in one his Prefaces, says that Timocreon came to the great king of Persia, and being entertained by him, did eat an immense quantity of food; and when the king asked him, What he would do on the strength of it? he said that he would beat a great many Persians; and the next day, having vanquished a great many, one after another, taking them one by one, after this, he beat the air with his hands; and when they asked him what he wanted, he said that he had all those blows left in him if any one was inclined to come on.  And Clearchus, in the fifth book of his Lives, says, that Cantibaris the Persian, whenever his jaws were weary with eating, had his slaves to pour food into his mouth, which he kept open as if they were pouring it into an empty vessel. But Hellanicus, in the first book of his Tale of Deucalion, says that Erysichthon, the son of Myrmidon, being a man perfectly insatiable in respect of food, was called Aethon. And Polemon, in the first book of his Treatise addressed to Timaeus, says that among the Sicilians there was a temple consecrated to gluttony, and an image of Demeter Sito; near which, also, there was a statue of Himalis, as there is at Delphi one of Hermuchus, and as at Scolus, in Boeotia, there are statues of Megalartus and Megalomazus.

  * * * * *

[13.] G   [418] And Hecataeus says that the Egyptians were great bread-eaters, eating loaves of rye, called ??????????, and bruising barley to extract a drink from it; and on this account Alexinus, in his treatise on Contentment, says that Bocchoris and his father Neochabis were contented with a moderate quantity of food. Pythagoras of Samos, also, used food in moderation, as Lycon of Iasus relates in his treatise on Pythagoras. But he did not abstain from animal food, as Aristoxenus tells us; and Apollodorus the mathematician says, that he even sacrificed a hecatomb when he found out that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the side subtending the right angle is equal to the squares of the two sides containing it- 
  When the illustrious Pythagoras 
  Discovered that renowned problem which 
  He celebrated with a hecatomb.

[419] But Pythagoras was a very sparing drinker, and lived in a most frugal manner, so that he often contented himself with honey by itself. And nearly the same thing is told us of Aristeides, and of Epaminondas, and of Phocion, and of Phormion, the generals. #  But Manius Curius, the Roman general, lived on turnips all his life; and once, when the Sabines sent him a large sum of gold, he said he had no need of gold while he ate such food as that. And this story is recorded by Megacles in his treatise on Illustrious Men.

[14.] G   And there are many people who approve of moderate meals, as Alexis tells us in his Woman in Love- 
  But I am content with what is necessary, 
  And hate superfluous things; for in excess 
  There is not pleasure, but extravagance.

And in his Liar he says- 
  I hate excess; for those who practise it 
  Have only more expense, but not more pleasure.

And in his Foster Brothers he says- 
  How sweet all kinds of moderation are! 
  I now am going away, not empty, but 
  In a most comfortable state,- for wise 
  Mnesitheus tells us that 'tis always right 
  To avoid extravagance in everything.

And Ariston the philosopher, in the second book of his Amatory Similitudes, says that Polemon, the Academic philosopher, used to exhort those who were going to a supper, to consider how they might make their party pleasant, not only for the present evening, but also for the morrow. And Timotheus, the son of Conon, being once taken by Plato from a very sumptuous and princely entertainment to one held at the Academy, and being there feasted in a simple and scholar-like manner, said that those who supped with Plato would be well the next day also. But Hegesander, in his Commentaries, says that on the next day Timotheus, meeting with Plato, said, "You, O Plato, sup well, more with reference to the next day than to the present one!" But Pyrrhon of Elis, when on one occasion one of his acquaintances received him with a very sumptuous entertainment, as he himself relates, said, "I will for the future not come to you if you receive me in this manner; that I may avoid being grieved by seeing you go to a great expense for which there is no necessity, and that you, too, may not come to distress by being overwhelmed by such expenses; for it is much better for us to delight one another by our mutual companionship and conversation, than by the great variety of dishes which we set before one another, of which our servants consume the greater part."

[15.] G   #  But Antigonus of Carystus, in his Life of Menedemus, relating the way in which the banquets of that philosopher were managed, says, that he used to dine with one or two companions at most; and that all the rest of his guests used to come after they had supped. For in fact, Menedemus' supper and dinner were only one meal, and after that was over they called in all who chose to come; and if any of them, as would be the case, came before the time, they would walk up and down before the doors, and inquire of the servants who came out what was being now served up, and how far on the dinner had proceeded. And if they heard that it was only the vegetables or the cured fish that was being served up, they went away; but if they were told that the meat was put on the table, then they went into the room which had been prepared for that purpose. [420] And in the summer a rush mat was spread over each couch, and in the winter a fleece. But every one was expected to bring his own pillow; and the cup, which was brought round to each person, did not hold more than one cotyla. And the dessert was lupins or beans as a general rule; but sometimes some fruits, such as were in season, were brought in; in summer, pears or pomegranates; and in spring, pulse; and in winter, figs. And we have a witness as to these things, Lycophron of Chalcis, who wrote a satyric drama entitled Menedemus, in which Silenus says to the satyrs- 
  O cursed sons of most excellent Pan, 
  I, as you see, have quite a fancy for you: 
  For, by the gods I swear, that not in Caria, 
  Nor in fair Rhodes, nor royal Lydia, 
  Have I ever eaten so superb a supper; 
  Phoebus Apollo! what a feast it was.

And a little further on, he says- 
  And the boy brought us round a scanty cup 
  Of wine that might be worth five obols a bottle- 
  Awfully flat; and then that cursed thing, 
  That hang-dog lupin, danced upon the board, 
  A fitting meal for parasites and beggars.

And presently afterwards, he says that philosophical disquisitions were carried on during the entertainment- 
  And for dessert, 
  We had some learned conversation.

It is also related that those who met in this way very often kept on conversing to such a time that "the bird which calls the morn still caught them talking, and they were not yet satisfied."

[16.] G   # But Arcesilaus, when giving a supper to some people, when the bread fell short, and his slave made him a sign that there were no loaves left, burst out laughing, and clapped his hands; and said, "What a feast we have here, my friends! We forgot to buy loaves enough; run now, my boy:"- and this he said, laughing; and all the guests who were present burst out laughing, and great amusement and entertainment were excited, so that the very want of bread was a great seasoning to the feast. And at another time, Arcesilaus ordered Apelles, one of his friends, to strain some wine; and when he, not being used to doing so, shook some of the wine and spilt some, so that the wine appeared much thicker than usual, he laughed, and said, "But I told a man to strain the wine who has never seen anything good any more than I myself have; so do you now get up, Arideices; and do you go away and tap the casks that are outside." And this good-humour of his so pleased and excited the mirth of those present, that they were all filled with joy.

[17.] G   But those of the present day who give entertainments, especially the inhabitants of the beautiful Alexandria, cry out, and make a noise, and curse the cup-bearer, the steward, and cook; and the slaves are all crying, being beaten with fists and driven about in every direction. And not only do the guests who are invited sup with great discomfort and annoyance, but even if there is any sacrifice going on, the god himself would veil his face and go away, leaving not only the house, but even the entire city, in which such things take place. For it is absurd for a man, proclaiming that people should all confine themselves to words of good omen, to curse his wife and his children; and such a man as that would say to the guests [ Homer, Il_2'381 ] - 
  And now then let us hasten to the feast, 
  That we may plan the movements of the war;-

for such a man's house [ Sophocles, OedTyr_4 ] 
  Is redolent of frankincense, 
  [421] And paeans too, and groans at the same time.

Now, when all this had been said, one of the guests who were present said,- We ought, then, when we consider these things; to guard against indulging our appetites too much; 
  For a frugal dinner breeds no drunkenness, 
as Amphis says, in his Pan: nor does it produce insolence or insulting conduct; as Alexis testifies in his Odysseus Weaving, where he says- 
  For many a banquet which endures too long, 
  And many and daily feasts, are wont to cause 
  Insult and mockery; and those kind of jests 
  Give far more pain than they do raise amusement. 
  For such are the first ground of evil-speaking; 
  And if you once begin to attack your neighbour, 
  You quickly do receive back all you bring, 
  And then abuse and quarrels surely follow; 
  Then blows and drunken riot. For this is 
  The natural course of things, and needs no prophet.

[18.] G   And Mnesimachus, in his Philippus, on account of the immoderate indulgence in dinners of people of his time, introduces an entertainment which professes to be a preparation for war, and which really is what that admirable writer Xenophon [ Hell_3.4'17 ] calls a workshop of war. And he speaks thus-
  Know you now with what men you must fight? 
  With us, who sup upon well-sharpened swords, 
  And swallow lighted firebrands for dainties: 
  And then, for our dessert, our slaves bring in, 
  After the first course, Cretan bows and arrows; 
  And, instead of vetches, broken heads of spears, 
  And fragments of well-battered shields and breastplates; 
  And at our feet lie slings, and stones, and bows, 
  And on our heads are wreaths of catapults.

And Phoenix of Colophon says- 
  A cask of wine shall be our sword- a cup 
  Shall be our spear- our hair shall arrows be; 
  Goblets shall be our enemies- wine our horses- 
  Ointments and perfumes our war-cry fierce.

And in the Parasite, Alexis, speaking of some very voracious person, says- 
  And all the younger men do call him parasite, 
  Using a gentler name; but he cares not. 
  And Telephus in speechless silence sits, 
  Making but signs to those who ask him questions; 
  So that the inviter often offers prayers 
  To the great Samothracian gods of the sea, 
  To cease their blowing, and to grant a calm; 
  For that young man's a storm to all his friends.

And Diphilus, in his Heracles, speaking of some similar kind of person, says- 
  Do you not now behold me drunk and merry, 
  Well filled with wine, and all inflamed with anger? 
  Have not I just devoured a dozen cakes, 
  Every one larger than a good-sized shield?

On which account, Bion of Borysthenes said, cleverly enough, that " A man ought not to derive his pleasures from the table, but from meditation;" and Euripides says- 
  I pleased my palate with a frugal meal; 
signifying that the pleasure derived from eating and drinking is chiefly limited to the mouth. And Aeschylus, in his Phineus, says- 
  And many a most deceitful meal they snatched 
  Away from hungry jaws, in haste to enjoy 
  The first delight of the too eager palate.

And in his Stheneboea, Euripides speaks of frugality thus- 
  A life at sea is a much troubled life, 
  [422] Not reinforced with pleasures of the table, 
  But like a stable on the shore. The sea itself 
  Is a moist mother, not a nurse on land; 
  'Tis her we plough; from this our food, procured 
  With nets and traps, comes daily home to us.

[19.] G   For the belly is a great evil to man; concerning which Alexis speaks, in his Men Dying Together- 
  And hence you well may see how great an evil 
  The belly is to man; what lessons strange 
  It teaches, and what deeds it forces on us. 
  If there were any power which could take 
  This part alone from out our bodies, then 
  No one would any more do injury 
  Or insult to his neighbour. But from this 
  Flow all the ills that harass human life.

And Diphilus, in his Parasite, says- 
  Well did that wise Euripides oft speak, 
  And this does seem his wisest word of all- 
  "But want compels me and my wretched belly;" 
  For there is nought more wretched than the belly: 
  And into that you pour whatever you have, 
  Which you do not in any other vessel. 
  Loaves you perhaps may carry in a bag,- 
  Not soup, or else you'll spoil it. So again, 
  You put cakes in a basket, but not pulse; 
  And wine into a bladder, but not crabs: 
  But into this accursed belly, men 
  Put every sort of inconsistent thing. 
  I add no more; since it is plain enough 
  That all men's errors are produced by it.

# And Crates the Cynic, as Sosicrates tells us in his Successions, reproached Demetrius Phalereus for sending him a bag of bread with a flagon of wine.  "I wish," said he, "that the fountains bore bread." And Stilpon did not think himself guilty of intemperance when, having eaten garlic, he went to sleep in the temple of the Mother of the Gods; but all who eat of that food were forbidden even to enter into it. But when the goddess appeared to him in his sleep, and said, "O Stilpon, do you, though you are a philosopher, transgress the law?" he thought that he made answer to her (still being asleep), "Do you give me something better to eat, and I will not eat garlic."

  * * * * *

[25.] G   [425] And so great was the luxury of the ancients in respect of their sumptuous meals, that they not only had cupbearers, but also men whom they called oenoptae (inspectors of wines). At all events, the office of oenoptae is a regular office among the Athenians; and it is mentioned by Eupolis, in his play called The Cities, in the following lines- 
  And men whom heretofore you'd not have thought 
  Fit even to make oenoptae of, we now 
  See made our generals. But oh, city, city! 
  How much your fortune does outrun your sense.

And these oenoptae superintended the arrangement of banquets, taking care that the guests should drink on equal terms. But it was an office of no great dignity, as Philinus the orator tells us, in his debate on the Croconidae. And he tells us, too, that the oenoptae were three in number, and that they also provided the guests with lamps and wicks. And some people called them "eyes;" but among the Ephesians, the youths who acted as cupbearers at the festival of Poseidon were called "bulls," as Amerias tells us. And the people of the Hellespont call the cupbearer ?????????, or the pourer out; and they call carving, which we call ?????????, ??????????, as Demetrius of Scepsis tells us, in the twenty-sixth book of his Arrangement of the Trojan Forces. And some say that the nymph Harmonia acted as cupbearer to the gods; as Capito the epic poet relates (and he was a native of Alexandria by birth), in the second book of his Love Poems. But Alcaeus also represents Hermes as their cupbearer; as also does Sappho, who says- 
  And with ambrosia was a goblet mixed, 
  And Hermes poured it out to all the gods.

[26.] G   But the ancients used to call the men who discharged this office, heralds (???????). Homer says [ Il_3'245 ] - 
  Meanwhile the heralds through the crowded town 
  Bring the rich wine and destined victims down. 
  Idaeus' arms the golden goblets pressed, 
  Who thus the venerable king addressed.

And a few lines further on he says [ Il_3'268 ] - 
  On either side a sacred herald stands; 
  The wine they mix, and on each monarch's hands 
  Pour the full urn.

But Cleidemus says that the cooks used to be called heralds. And some people have represented Hebe as acting as cup-bearer to the gods, perhaps because their banquets were called Hebeteria. #  And Ptolemaeus, the son of Agesarchus, speaks of a damsel named Cleino as the cupbearer of Ptolemy the king, who was surnamed Philadelphus, mentioning her in the third book of his History of Philopator. But Polybius, in the fourteenth book of his History [ 14.11 ], adds that there are statues of her in Alexandria, in many parts of the city, clad in a tunic alone, holding a cup in her hand.

  * * * * *

[40.] G   [432] And many used to put lumps of barley meal into their wine when they drank, a custom which Hegesander of Delphi mentions. Accordingly Epinicus, when Mnesiptolemus had given a recitation of his history, in which it was written how Seleucus had used meal in his wine, having written a drama entitled Mnesiptolemus, and having turned him into ridicule, as the comic poets do, and using his own words about that sort of drink, represents him as saying: 
  Once I beheld the noble king Seleucus, 
  One summer's day, drinking with mighty pleasure 
  Some wine with meal steeped in it. (So I took 
  A note of it, and showed it to a crowd, 
  Although it was an unimportant thing, 
  Yet still my genius could make it serious.) 
  He took some fine old Thasian wine, and then 
  Some of the liquor which the Attic bee 
  Distils who culls the sweets from every flower; 
  And that he mingled in a marble cup, 
  And mixed the liquor with Demeter's corn, 
  And took the draught, a respite from the heat.

And the same writer tells us that in the Therades islands men mash lentils and pease into meal, instead of ordinary corn, and put that into the wine, and that this drink is said to be better than that in which the meal is mixed.

  * * * * *

[50.] G   [437] But Antigonus of Carystus, in his essay on the Life of Dionysius of Heracleia, who was called the Turncoat (Metathemenos), says that Dionysius, when he was feasting with his slaves at the festival of the Pitchers, and was not able, by reason of his old age, to avail himself of the courtesan whom they brought him, turned round and said to those who were feasting with him [ Homer, Il_21'152 ] - 
  I cannot now, so let another take her.

But Dionysius, as Nicias of Nicaea tells us in his Successions, had been from the time he was a boy very wanton in the indulgence of his lustfulness; and he used to go to all the prostitutes promiscuously.  And once, when walking with some of his acquaintances, when he came near the house where the girls are kept, and where, having been there the day before, he had left some money owing, as he happened to have some with him then, he put out his hand and paid it in the presence of all of them. [438] And Anacharsis the Scythian, when a prize for drinking was proposed at the table of Periander, demanded the prize, because he was the first man to be drunk of all the guests who were present; as if to get to the end were the goal to be aimed at, and the victory to be achieved in drinking as in running a race. But Lacydes and Timon the philosophers, being invited to an entertainment which was to last two days, by one of their friends, and wishing to adapt themselves to the rest of the guests, drank with great eagerness. And accordingly in the first day, Lacydes went away first, as soon as he was quite satiated with drink. And Timon, seeing him as he was departing, said [ Homer, Il_22'393 ] - 
  Now have we gained immortal praise and fame, 
  Since we have slain great Hector. . .

But on the next day Timon went away first because he could not drink up the goblet in which he had been pledged, and Lacydes seeing him departing, said [ Homer, Il_6'127 ] - 
  Wretched are they who dare encounter me.

[51.] G   And Herodotus, in his second book [ 2.133 ], relates that Mycerinus the Egyptian, having been told by the soothsayers that he was fated to live but a short time, used to light a great number of lamps when night arrived, and spend all his time in drinking and luxury, relaxing neither by day nor by night; and when he withdrew into the marshes and into the groves, or wherever he heard that there were meetings of young people to amuse themselves, he always got drunk. And Herodotus tells us that Amasis also, who was another of the Egyptian kings, was a very hard drinker indeed. And Hermeias of Methymna, in the third book of his History of Sicily, says that Nicoteles the Corinthian was a man greatly addicted to drinking. And Phaenias of Eresus, in the book entitled, The Slaying of Tyrants out of Revenge, says that Scopas the son of Creon, and the grandson of the former Scopas, was throughout his whole life very fond of drinking; and that he used to return from banquets at which he had been present, sitting on a throne, and carried by four bearers, and in that way he used to enter his house. # And Phylarchus, in the sixth book of his Histories [ Fr_6 ], says that Antiochus the king was a man very fond of wine; and that he used to get drunk, and then go to sleep for a long time, and then, as evening came on, he would wake up, and drink again. And it was very seldom, says he, that he transacted the affairs of his kingdom when he was sober, but much more frequently when he was drunk; on which account there were two men about him who managed all the real business of the state as they pleased, namely Aristus and Themison, Cyprians by birth, and brothers; and they were both on terms of the greatest intimacy with Antiochus.

[52.] G   #  And Antiochus the king, who was surnamed Epiphanes, was also a great drinker,- the one, I mean, who had been a hostage among the Romans, whom Ptolemy Euergetes mentions in the third book of his Commentaries, and also in the fifth; saying that he turned to Indian revellings and drunkenness, and spent a vast quantity of money in those practices; and for the rest of the money which he had at hand, he spent a part of it in his daily revels, and the rest he would scatter about, standing in the public streets, and saying, "Let whoever chance gives it to, take it:" and then, throwing the money about, he would depart. And very often, having a plaited garland of roses on his head, and wearing a golden embroidered robe, he would walk about alone, having stones under his arm, which he would throw at those of his friends who were following him. And he used to bathe also in the public baths, anointed all over with perfumes; and, on one occasion, some private individual, seeing him, said, "You are a happy man, O king; you smell in a most costly manner:" and he, being much pleased, said, "I will give you as much as you can desire of this perfume." And so he ordered an ewer containing more than two choes of thick perfumed unguent to be poured over his head; so that the multitude of the poorer people who were about all collected to gather up what was spilt; and, as the place was made very slippery by it, Antiochus himself slipped and fell, laughing a great deal, and most of the bathers did the same.

[439] But Polybius, in the twenty-sixth book of his Histories [ 26.1 ], calls this man Epimanes (mad), and not Epiphanes (illustrious), on account of his actions.- "For he not only used to go to entertainments of the common citizens, but he also would drink with any strangers who happened to be sojourning in the city, and even with those of the meanest class. And if," says Polybius, "he heard that any of the younger men were making a feast anywhere whatever, he would come with an earthen bowl, and with music, so that the greater part of the feasters fled away alarmed at his unexpected appearance. And very often he would put off his royal robes, and take a common cloak, and in that dress go round the market."

[53.] G   #  And in the thirty-first book of his Histories [ 30.25 ], the same Polybius tells us "that when Antiochus was celebrating some public games at Antioch, he invited all the Greeks and any of the multitude who chose to come to the spectacle. And when a great many people came, he anointed them all in the gymnnasia with ointment of saffron, and cinnamon, and nard, and amaracus, and lilies, out of golden vessels: and then, inviting them all to a feast, he filled sometimes a thousand and sometimes fifteen hundred triclinia with the most expensive preparations; and he himself personally attended to waiting on the guests. For, standing at the entrance, he introduced some, and others he placed upon the couches; and he himself marshalled the servants who brought in the different courses; and, walking about among the guests, at times he sat down in one place, and at times he lay down in another. And sometimes he would put down what he was eating, and at other times he would lay down his cup, and jump up, and change his place, and go all round the party, standing up himself, and pledging different people at different times; and then, mingling with the musicians, he would be brought in by the actors, entirely covered up, and laid down on the ground, as if he had been one of the actors himself; and then, when the music gave the signal, the king would leap up, and dance and sport among the actors, so that they were all ashamed. To such absurdities does a want of education, when joined with drunkenness, reduce miserable men." #  And his namesake, the Antiochus who carried on war in Media against Arsaces, was very fond of drinking; as Poseidonius of Apameia relates in the sixteenth book of his History [ Fr_11 ]. Accordingly, when he was slain, he says that Arsaces, when he buried him, said- "Your courage and your drunkenness have ruined you, O Antiochus; for you hoped that, in your great cups, you would be able to drink up the kingdom of Arsaces."

[54.] G   #  But the Antiochus who was surnamed the Great, who was subdued by the Romans (as Polybius relates in his twentieth book [ 20.8 ]), having arrived at Chalcis, in Euboea, celebrated a marriage when he was fifty years of age; and after he had undertaken two most enormous and important affairs, namely, the liberation of the Greeks (as he himself professed) and the war against the Romans. At all events, he, being smitten with love for a girl of Chalcis, was very anxious to marry her at the very time that he was engaged in this war, being a man very fond of drinking and delighting in drunkenness. And she was the daughter of Cleophanes, one of the nobles, and superior to all the maidens of her country in beauty. Accordingly, he celebrated his marriage in Chalcis, and remained there all the winter, not once giving the smallest thought to the important affairs which he had in hand. And he gave the girl the name of Euboea. Accordingly, being defeated in the war, he fled to Ephesus, with his newly-married bride. [440] And in the second book [ 2.4 ], the same Polybius relates that Agron, the king of the Illyrians, being delighted at having gained a victory over the haughty Aetolians, being a man much addicted to drinking, and to drunkenness, and banqueting, fell ill of a pleurisy, and died. #  And the same historian says, in his twenty-ninth book [ 29.13 ], that Genthion, the king of the Illyrians, on account of his great fondness for drinking, did a great many intemperate things during his life, being incessantly drunk, both night and day; and having murdered Pleuratus, his brother, who was about to marry the daughter of Menunius, he married the girl himself, and treated his subjects with great cruelty. And he says, in the thirty-third book of his History [ 33.19 ], that Demetrius, when he fled after having been a hostage at Rome, and became king of the Syrians, became a great drinker, and was drunk the greater part of the day. #  And he also, in his thirty-second book [ 32.11 ], says that Orophernes, who was for a short time king of Cappadocia, disregarded all the customs of his country, and introduced the artificial luxury of the Ionians.

[55.] G   On which account, that most divine of writers, Plato, lays down admirable laws in his second book [ Laws_2.666'a ] - "That boys, till they are eighteen years of age, should absolutely never taste wine at all; for that it is not well to heap fire on fire: that men up to thirty years of age may drink wine in moderation; and that the young man should wholly abstain from much wine and from drunkenness. But that a man, when he arrives at forty years of age, may feast in large banquets, and invoke the other gods, and especially Dionysus, to the feasts and amusements of the older men; since he it is who has given men this means of indulgence, as an ally against the austerity of old age, for which wine was the best medicine; so that, owing to it, we grow young again, and forget our moroseness." And then he proceeds to say- "But there is a report and story told that this god was once deprived of his mind and senses by his mother-in-law, Hera; on which account he sent Bacchic frenzy, and all sorts of frantic rage, among men, out of revenge for the treatment which he had experienced; on which account also he gave wine to men."

[56.] G   But Phalaecus, in his Epigrams, makes mention of a woman, whose name was Cleo, as having been a very hard drinker- 
  Cleo bestowed this gift on Dionysus, 
  The tunic, fringed with gold and saffron hues, 
  Which long she wore herself; so great she was 
  At feasts and revelry: there was no man 
  Who could at all contend with her in drinking.

And it is a well-known fact that all the race of women is fond of drinking. And it was not without some wit that Xenarchus introduces, in his Pentathlon, a woman swearing this most horrible oath:- 
  May it be granted me to pass from life 
  Drinking abundant draughts of wine, while you, 
  My darling daughter, live and prosper here.

But among the Romans, as Polybius says, in his sixth book [ 6.11a'4 ], it was forbidden to women to drink wine at all. However, they drink what is called passum; and that is made of raisins, and when drank is very like the sweet wines of Aegosthena and Crete, on which account men use it when oppressed by excessive thirst. And it is impossible for a woman to drink wine without being detected: for, first of all, she has not the key of the cellar; and, in the next place, she is bound to kiss her relations, and those of her husband, down to cousins, and to do this every day when she first sees them; and besides this, she is forced to be on her best behaviour, as it is quite uncertain whom she may chance to meet; [441] for if she has merely tasted wine, it needs no informer, but is sure to betray itself."

And Alcimus the Sicilian, in that book of his which is entitled the Italian History, says that all the women in Italy avoid drinking wine on this account: "When Heracles was in the district of Croton, he one day was very thirsty, and came to a certain house by the wayside and asked for something to drink; and it happened that the wife of the master of the house had secretly opened a cask of wine, and therefore she said to her husband that it would be a shameful thing for him to open this cask for a stranger; and so she told him to give Heracles some water. But Heracles, who was standing at the door, and heard all this, praised her husband very much, but advised him to go indoors himself and look at the cask. And when he had gone in, he found that the cask had become petrified. And this fact is proved by the conduct of the women of the country, among whom it is reckoned disgraceful, to this day, to drink wine, on account of the above-mentioned reason."

[57.] G   And what sort of women those among the Greeks are who get drunk, Antiphanes tells us, in his Woman Hit by a Javelin; where he says- 
  I have a neighbour who sells wine, 
  And he, whenever I arrive, being thirsty, 
  Is the only man who knows the proper way 
  In which to mix my wine; and makes it not 
  Too full of water, nor too strong and heady: 
  I recollect that once when I was drinking .....

And, in his Woman Initiated, (and it is women who are conversing,) he writes- 
  (A)   Would you now like, my dearest friend, to drink? 
  (B)   No doubt I should. 
  (A)   Well come, then, take a cup; 
  For they do say the first three cups one takes 
  All tend to the honour of the heavenly gods.

And Alexis, in his Female Dancer, says- 
  (A)   But women are quite sure to be content 
  If they have only wine enough to drink. 
  (B)   But, by the heavenly twins, we now shall have 
  As much as we can wish; and it shall be 
  Sweet, and not griping,- rich, well-seasoned wine, 
  Exceeding old. 
  (A)   I like this aged sphinx; 
  For hear how now she talks to me in riddles. 
And so on. And, in his Zeus the Mourner, he mentions a certain woman named Zopyra, and says- 
  Zopyra, that wine-cask.

Antiphanes, in his The Bacchants- 
  But since this now is not the case, I'm sure 
  He is a wretched man who ever marries 
  Except among the Scythians; for their country 
  Is the sole land which does not bear the vine.

And Xenarchus, in his Pentathlon, says- 
  I write a woman's oath in mighty wine.

[58.] G   Platon, in his Phaon, relating how many things happen to women because of wine, says- 
  Come now, ye women, long ago have I 
  Prayed that this wine may thus become your folly; 
  For you don't think, as the old proverb goes, 
  That there is any wisdom at a vintner's. 
  For if you now desire to see Phaon, 
  You first must all these solemn rites perform. 
  First, as the nurse of youths, I must receive 
  A vigorous cheesecake, and a pregnant mealcake, 
  And sixteen thrushes whole, well smeared with honey, 
  Twelve hares, all taken when the moon was full; 
  But all the other things may be got cheaply. 
  Now listen. Three half-measures of fine onions; 
  These for Orthannes. For Conisalus 
  And his two mates, a plate of myrtleberries, 
  [442] Plucked with the hand: for the great Gods above 
  Dislike the smell of lamps. You must offer 
  (?) A dark-coloured raisin for the dogs and huntsmen. 
  A drachma for Lordon; for Cybdasus, 
  Three obols; for the mighty hero Celes, 
  Some hides and incense. Now if you bring 
  These things, you'll certainly obtain admittance; 
  But if you don't, you'll knock in vain, and long 
  In vain to enter, and get nothing by it.

And Axionicus says, in his Philinna- 
  Just trust a woman to drink no water.

[59.] G   And whole nations are mentioned as addicted to drunkenness. Accordingly, Baeton, the measurer of distances for Alexander, in his book which is entitled Stations of the March of Alexander, and Amyntas also, in his Stations, says that the nation of the Tapyri is so fond of wine that they never use any other unguent than that. And Ctesias tells the same story, in his book Concerning the Revenues in Asia. And he says that they are a most just people. And Harmodius of Lepreum, in his treatise on the Laws in force among the people of Phigaleia, says that the Phigaleians are addicted to drinking, being neighbours of the Messenians, and being also a people much accustomed to travelling. And Phylarchus, in his sixth book [ Fr_7 ], says that the Byzantians are so exceedingly fond of wine, that they live in the wine-shops and let out their own houses and their wives also to strangers: and that they cannot bear to hear the sound of a trumpet even in their sleep. On which account once, when they were attacked by the enemy, and could not endure the labour of defending their walls, Leonidas, their general, ordered the innkeepers' booths to be erected as tents upon the walls, and even then it was with difficulty that they were stopped from deserting, as Damon tells us, in his book on Byzantium. But Menander, in his play called the Woman carrying the Peplos of Athene, or the Female Flute-player, says- 
  Byzantium makes all the merchants drunk. 
  On your account we drank the whole night long, 
  And right strong wine too, as it seems to me,- 
  At least I got up with four heads, I think.

And the Argives too are ridiculed by the comic poets as addicted to drunkenness; and so are the Tirynthians by Ephippus, in his Busiris. And he introduces Heracles as saying- 
  (A)   For how in the name of all the gods at once, 
  Do you not know me, the Tirynthian Argive? 
  That race fights all its battles when it's drunk. 
  (B)   And that is why they always run away.

And Eubulus, in his Man Glued, says that the Milesians are very insolent when they are drunk. And Polemon, in his treatise on the Inscriptions to be found in Cities, speaking of the Eleans, produces this epigram:- 
  Elis is always drunk, and always lying: 
  As is each single house, so is the city.

[64.] G   [445] When Ulpianus had heard all this he said,- Tell me, my good Pontianus, says he, in what author does the word ???????? occur? And he replied- 
  You will undo me with your questions 
(as the excellent Agathon says)- 
  .... and your new fashion, 
  Always talking at an unseasonable time.

But since it is decided that we are to be responsible to you for every word, Antiphanes, in his Lydian, has said- 
  A Colchian man drunken and quarrelsome (????????).

But you are not yet satisfied about your ????????, and drunkards; #  nor do you consider that Eumenes the king of Pergamum, the nephew of Philetaerus, who had formerly been king of Pergamum, died of drunkenness, as Ctesicles relates, in the third book of his Chronicles. #  But, however, Perseus, whose power was put down by the Romans, did not die in that way; for he did not imitate his father Philippus in anything; for he was not eager about women, nor was he fond of wine; but when at a feast he was not only moderate himself, but all his friends who were with him were so too, as Polybius relates, in his twenty-sixth book. But you, O Ulpianus, are a most immoderate drinker yourself (????????????), as Timon of Phlius calls it. For so he called those men who drink a great quantity of unmixed wine, in the second book of his Silli- 
  Or that great ox-goad, harder than Lycurgus', 
  Who smote the ???????????? of Dionysus, 
  And threw their cups and brimming ladles down.

For I do not call you simply ???????, or fond of drinking; and this last is a word which Alcaeus has used, in his Ganymedes. And that a habit of getting drunk deceives our eyesight, Anacharsis has shown plainly enough, in what he says where he shows that mistaken opinions are taken up by drunken men. For a fellow-drinker of his once, seeing his wife at a banquet, said, "Anacharsis, you have married an ugly woman." And he replied, "Indeed I think so too, but however now, give me, O boy, a cup of stronger wine, that I may make her out beautiful."

[15.] G   [518] The tables of the Sicilians also are very notorious for their luxury. "And they say that even the sea in their region is sweet, delighting in the food which is procured from it," as Clearchus says, in the fifth book of his Lives. And why need we mention the Sybarites, among whom bathing men and pourers of water were first introduced in fetters, in order to prevent their going too fast, and to prevent also their scalding the bathers in their haste? And the Sybarites were the first people to forbid those who practice noisy arts from dwelling in their city; such as blacksmiths, and carpenters, and men of similar trades; providing that their slumbers should always be undisturbed. And it used to be unlawful to rear a cock in their city.

And Timaeus relates concerning them, that a citizen of Sybaris once going into the country, seeing the farmers digging, said that he himself felt as if he had broken his bones by the sight; and some one who heard him replied, "I, when I heard you say this, felt as if I had a pain in my side." And once, at Croton, some Sybarites were standing by some one of the athletes who was digging up dust for the palaestra, and said they marvelled that men who had such a city had no slaves to dig the palaestra for them. But another Sybarite, coming to Lacedaemon, and being invited to the pheiditium, sitting down on a wooden seat and eating with them, said that originally he had been surprised at hearing of the valour of the Lacedaemonians; but that now that he had seen it, he thought that they in no respect surpassed other men: for that the greatest coward on earth would rather die a thousand times than live and endure such a life as theirs.

[16.] G   And it is a custom among them that even their children, up to the age when they are ranked among the ephebes, should wear purple robes, and curls braided with gold. And it is a custom with them also to breed up in their houses little mannikins and dwarfs (as Timaeus says), who are called by some people ?????????; and also little Maltese dogs, which follow them even to the gymnasia. And it was these men, and men like them, to whom Masinissa, king of Mauretania, made answer (as Ptolemy relates, in the eighth book of his Commentaries), when they were seeking to buy some monkeys: "Why,- do not your wives, my good friends, produce any offspring?" For Masinissa was very fond of children, and kept about him and brought up the children of his sons, [519] and of his daughters equally, and he had a great many of them; and he brought them all up till they were three years old, and after that he sent them to their parents, having the younger ones to take their places. And Eubulus the comic writer has said the same thing in his Graces:- 
  For is it not, I pray you, better far 
  For one man, who can well afford such acts, 
  To rear a man, than a loud gaping goose, 
  Or sparrow, or ape - most mischievous of beasts?

And Athenodorus, in his treatise on Serious Studies and Amusements, says that "Archytas of Tarentum, who was both a statesman and a philosopher, having many slaves, was always delighted at his entertainments when any of [their children] came to his banquets. But the Sybarites delighted only in Maltese puppy dogs, and in men which were no men."

[17.] G   The Sybarites used to wear also garments made of Milesian wool, from which there arose a great friendship between the two cities, as Timaeus relates. For of the inhabitants of Italy, the Sybarites gave the preference to the Etruscans, and of foreigners to the Ionians, because they were devoted to luxury. But the cavalry of the Sybarites, being in number more than five thousand, used to go in procession with saffron-coloured robes over their breastplates; and in the summer their younger men used to go away to the caves of the Nymphs of the river Lusias, and live there in all kinds of luxury. And whenever the rich men of that country left the city for the country, although they always travelled in chariots, still they used to consume three days in a day's journey. And some of the roads which led to their villas in the country were covered with awnings all over; and a great many of them had cellars near the sea, into which their wine was brought by canals from the country, and some of it was then sold out of the district, but some was brought into the city in boats. They also celebrate in public numbers of feasts; and they honour those who display great magnificence on such occasions with golden crowns, and they proclaim their names at the public sacrifices and games; announcing not only their general goodwill towards the city, but also the great magnificence which they had displayed in the feasts. And on these occasions they even crown those cooks who have served up the most exquisite dishes. And among the Sybarites there were found baths in which, while they lay down, they were steamed with warm vapours. And they were the first people who introduced the custom of bringing chamber-pots to banquets. But laughing at those who left their countries to travel in foreign lands, they themselves used to boast that they had grown old without ever having crossed the bridges which led over their frontier rivers.

[18.] G   But it seems to me, that besides the fact of the riches of the Sybarites, the very natural character of their country,- since there are no harbours on their coasts, and since, in consequence, nearly all the produce of the land is consumed by the citizens themselves,- and to some extent also an oracle of the God, has excited them all to luxury, and has caused them to live in practices of most immoderate dissoluteness. But their city lies in a hollow, and in summer is liable to excess of cold both morning and evening, but in the middle of the day the heat is intolerable, so that the greater part of them believe that the rivers contribute a great deal to the health of the inhabitants; [520] on which account it has been said, that "a man who, living at Sybaris, wishes not to die before his time, ought never to see the sun either rise or set." And once they sent to the oracle to consult the God (and one of the ambassadors was named Amyris), and to ask how long their prosperity should last; and the priestess of Delphi answered them- 
  You shall be happy, Sybarite,- very happy, 
  And all your time in entertainments pass, 
  While you continue to the immortal gods 
  The worship due: but when you come, at length, 
  To honour mortal man beyond the gods, 
   Then foreign war and intestine sedition 
  Shall come upon you, and shall crush your city.

When they had heard this they thought the God had said to them that they should never have their luxury terminated; for that there was no chance of their ever honouring a man more than God. But in agreement with the oracle they experienced a change of fortune, when one of them flogging one of his slaves, continued to beat him after he had sought an asylum in a temple; but when at last he fled to the tomb of his father, he let him go, out of shame.  But their whole revenues were dissipated by the way in which they rivalled one another in luxury. And the city also rivalled all other cities in luxury. And not long after this circumstance, when many omens of impending destruction, which it is not necessary to allude to further at present, had given them notice, they were destroyed.

[19.] G   But they had carried their luxury to such a pitch that they had taught even their horses to dance at their feasts to the music of the flute. Accordingly the people of Croton, knowing this, and being at war with them, as Aristotle relates in his History of the Constitution of Sybaris,  played before their horses the tune to which they were accustomed to dance; for the people of Croton also had flute-players in military uniform. And as soon as the horses heard them playing on the flute, they not only began to dance, but ran over to the army of the Crotonians, carrying their riders with them.

And Charon of Lampsacus tells a similar story about the Cardians, in the second book of his Annals, writing as follows:-" The Bisaltae invaded the territory of the Cardians, and conquered them. The general of the Bisaltae was Onaris; and he, while he was a boy, had been sold as a slave in Cardia;  and having lived as a slave to one of the Cardians, he had been taught the trade of a barber. And the Cardians had an oracle warning them that the Bisaltae would some day invade them; and they very often used to talk over this oracle while sitting in this barber's shop. And Onaris, escaping from Cardia to his own country, prompted the Bisaltae to invade the Cardians, and was himself elected general of the Bisaltae. But all the Cardians had been in the habit of teaching their horses to dance at their feasts to the music of the flute; and they, standing on their hind feet, used to dance with their fore feet in time to the airs which they had been taught. Onaris then, knowing these things, got a female flute-player from among the Cardians.  And this female flute-player coming to the Bisaltae, taught many of their flute-players; and when they had learnt sufficiently, he took them in his army against the Cardians. And when the battle took place, he ordered the flute-players to play the tunes which they had learnt, and which the horses of the Cardians knew. And when the horses heard the flute, they stood up on their hind feet, and took to dancing. But the main strength of the Cardians was in their cavalry, and so they were conquered."

[521] And one of the Sybarites, once wishing to sail over to Croton, hired a vessel to carry him by himself, on condition that no one was to splash him, and that no one else was to be taken on board, and that he might take his horse with him. And when the captain of the ship had agreed to these terms, he put his horse on board, and ordered some straw to be spread under the horse. And afterwards he begged one of those who had accompanied him down to the vessel to go with him, saying, "I have already stipulated with the captain of the ship to keep along the shore." But he replied, "I should have had great difficulty in complying with your wishes if you had been going to walk along the seashore, much less can I do so when you are going to sail along the land."

[20.] G    But Phylarchus, in the twenty-fifth book of his History [ Fr_45 ], (having said that there was a law at Syracuse, that the women should not wear golden ornaments, nor garments embroidered with flowers, nor robes with purple borders, unless they admitted that they were public prostitutes; and that there was another law, that a man should not adorn his person, nor wear any extraordinarily handsome robes, different from the rest of the citizens, unless he meant to confess that he was an adulterer and a profligate: and also, that a freewoman was not to walk abroad when the sun had set, unless she was going to commit adultery; and even by day they were not allowed to go out without the leave of the regulators of the women, and without one female servant following them,)- Phylarchus, I say, states, that "the Sybarites, having given loose to their luxury, made a law that women might be invited to banquets, and that those who intended to invite them to sacred festivities must make preparation a year before, in order that they might have all that time to provide themselves with garments and other ornaments in a suitable manner worthy of the occasion, and so might come to the banquet to which they were invited. And if any caterer or cook invented any peculiar and excellent dish, no other artist was allowed to make this for a year; but he alone who invented it was entitled to all the profit to be derived from the manufacture of it for that time; in order that others might be induced to labour at excelling in such pursuits. And in the same way, it was provided that those who sold eels were not so be liable to pay tribute, nor those who caught them either. And in the same way the laws exempted from all burdens those who dyed the marine purple and those who imported it."'

[21.] G   They then, having carried their luxury and insolence to a great height, at last, when thirty ambassadors came to them from the people of Croton, slew them all, and threw their bodies down over the wall, and left them there to be eaten by beasts. And this was the beginning of great evils to them, as the Deity was much offended at it. Accordingly, a few days afterwards all their chief magistrates appeared to see the same vision on one night; for they thought that they saw Hera coming into the midst of the market-place, and vomiting gall; and a spring of blood arose in her temple. But even then they did not desist from their arrogance, until they were all destroyed by the Crotonians. But Heracleides of Pontus, in his treatise on Justice, says, "The Sybarites having put down the tyranny of Telys and having destroyed all those who had exercised authority, (?) met them and slew them at the altar of the gods. And at the sight of this slaughter the statue of Hera turned itself away, and the floor sent up a fountain of blood, so that they were forced to cover all the place around with brazen tablets, wishing to stop the rising of the blood: on which account they were all driven from their city and destroyed. [522] And they had also been desirous to obscure the glory of the famous games at Olympia; for watching the time when they are celebrated, they attempted to draw over the athletes to their side by the extravagance of the prizes which they offered."

[22.] G   And the men of Croton, as Timaeus says, after they had destroyed the people of Sybaris, began to indulge in luxury; so that their chief magistrate went about the city clad in a purple robe, and wearing a golden crown on his head, and wearing also white sandals. But some say that this was not done out of luxury, but owing to Democedes the physician, who was by birth a native of Croton; and who having lived with Polycrates the tyrant of Samos, and having been taken prisoner by the Persians after his death, was taken to the king of Persia, after Oroetes had put Polycrates to death. And Democedes, having cured Atossa the wife of Darius, and daughter of Cyrus, who had a complaint in her breast, asked of her this reward, to be sent back to Greece, on condition of returning again to Persia; and having obtained his request he came to Croton. And as he wished to remain there, when some Persian laid hold of him and said that he was a slave of the king of Persia, the Crotonians took him away, and having stripped the Persian of his robe, dressed the servant of their chief magistrate in it. And from that time forward, the servant, having on the Persian robe, went round with the chief magistrate to all the altars on the seventh dayof every month; not for the sake of luxury or insolence, but doing it for the purpose of insulting the Persians. But after this the men of Croton, as Timaeus says, attempted to put an end to the Assembly at Olympia, by appointing a meeting for games with enormously rich prizes, to be held at exactly the same time as the Olympian games; but some say that the Sybarites did this.

[23.] G   But Clearchus, in the fourth book of his Lives, says that the people of Tarentum, after they had acquired strength and power, carried their luxury to such a height, that they used to make their whole body smooth, and that they were the first people who set other nations an example of this smoothness. They also, says he, all wore very beautiful fringes on their garments; such as those with which now the life of woman is refined. And afterwards, being led on by their luxury to insolence, they overthrew a city of the Iapyges, called Carbina, and collected all the boys and maidens, and women in the flower of their age, out of it into the temples of the Carbinians; and made a spectacle of them, exposing them naked by day for all who chose to come and look at them, so that whoever pleased, leaping, as it were, on this unfortunate band, might satisfy his appetite, with the beauty of those who were there assembled, in the sight of everyone, and above all of the Gods, whom they were thinking of but little. And this aroused the indignation of the Deity, so that he struck all the Tarentines who behaved so impiously in Carbina with his thunderbolts. And even to this day at Tarentum every one of the houses has the same number of pillars before its doors as that of the people who lived there before they were sent to Iapygia. And, when the day comes which is the anniversary of their death, they do not bewail those who perished at those pillars, nor do they offer the libations which are customary in other cases, but they offer sacrifices to Zeus the Thunderer.

[24.] G   Now the race of the Iapygians came originally from Crete, being descended from those Cretans who came to seek for Glaucus, and settled in that part of Italy; [523] but afterwards, they, forgetting the orderly life of the Cretans, came to such a pitch of luxury, and from thence to such a degree of insolence, that they were the first people who painted their faces and who worn headbands and false hair, and who clothed themselves in robes embroidered with flowers, and who considered it disgraceful to cultivate the land, or to do any kind of labour. And most of them made their houses more beautiful than the temples of the gods; and so they say, that the leaders of the Iapygians, treating the Deity with insult, destroyed the images of the gods out of the temples, ordering their betters to go elsewhere. On which account, being struck from heaven with fire and copper, they gave rise to reports [of their misfortune]; for indeed traces of the copper with which they were stricken down were visible a long time afterwards. And to this very day all their descendants live with shaven heads and in mourning apparel, in want of all the luxuries which previously belonged to them.

[25.] G   But the Iberians, although they go about in robes like those of the tragedians, and richly embroidered, and in tunics which reach down to the feet, are not at all hindered by their dress from displaying their vigour in war; but the people of Massilia became very effeminate, wearing the same highly ornamented kind of dress which the Iberians used to wear; but they behave in a shameless manner, on account of the effeminacy of their souls, behaving like women, out of luxury: from which the proverb has gone about, "May you sail to Massilia". And the inhabitants of Siris, which place was first inhabited by people who touched there on their escape from Troy, and after them by the Colophonians, as Timaeus and Aristotle tell us, indulged in luxury no less than the Sybarites; for it was a peculiar national custom of theirs to wear embroidered tunics, which they girded up with expensive girdles (??????); and on this account they were called by the inhabitants of the adjacent countries ????????????, since Homer calls those who have no girdles ?????????????. And Archilochus the poet marvelled beyond anything at the country of the Sirites, and at their prosperity. Accordingly, speaking of Thasos as inferior to Siris, he says:- 
  For there is not on earth a place so sweet, 
  Or lovely, or desirable, as that 
  Which stands upon the stream of Siris.

But the place was called Siris, as Timaeus asserts, and as Euripides says too in his play called Melanippe Captive, from a woman named Siris, but according to Archilochus, from a river of the same name. And the number of the population grew very great in all that region, owing to the luxurious and prosperous character of the country. On which account nearly all that part of Italy which was colonised by the Greeks was called Magna Graecia.

[30.] G   [525] But Duris, speaking concerning the luxury of the Samians, quotes the poems of Asius, to prove that they used to wear bracelets on their arms; and that, when celebrating the festival of Hera, they used to go about with their hair carefully combed down over the back of their head and over their shoulders; and he says that this is proved to have been their regular practice by this proverb- "To go, like a worshipper of Hera, with his hair braided."

Now the verses of Asius run as follows: 
  And they marched, with carefully combed hair 
  To the most holy spot of Hera's temple, 
  Clad in magnificent robes, whose snow-white folds 
  Reached to the ground of the extensive earth, 
  And golden knobs on them like grasshoppers, 
  And golden chaplets loosely held their hair, 
  Gracefully waving in the genial breeze; 
  And on their arms were bracelets, highly wrought, 
  . . . . . . . . . . (?) and sang 
  The praises of the mighty warrior.

But Heracleides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasure, [526] says that the Samians, being most extravagantly luxurious, destroyed the city, out of their meanness to one another, in the same way as as the Sybarites destroyed theirs.

[31.] G   But the Colophonians (as Phylarchus says [ Fr_66 ]), who originally adopted a very rigid course of life, when, in consequence of the alliance and friendship which they formed with the Lydians, they began to give way to luxury, used to go into public with their hair adorned with golden ornaments, as Xenophanes tells us- 
  They learnt all sorts of useless foolishness 
  From the effeminate Lydians, while they 
  Were held in bondage to sharp tyranny. 
  They went into the forum richly clad 
  In purple garments, in numerous companies, 
  Whose strength was not less than a thousand men, 
  Boasting of hair luxuriously dressed, 
  Dripping with costly and sweet-smelling oils.

And to such a degree did they carry their dissoluteness and their unseemly drunkenness, that some of them never once saw the sun either rise or set: and they passed a law, which continued even to our time, that the female flute-players and female harpers, and all such musicians and singers, should receive pay from daybreak to midday, and until the lamps were lit; but after that they set aside the rest of the night to get drunk in. And Theopompus, in the fifteenth book of his History, says, "that a thousand men of that city used to walk about the city, wearing purple garments, which was at that time a colour rare even among kings, and greatly sought after; for purple was constantly sold for its weight in silver. And so, owing to these practices, they fell under the power of tyrants, and became torn by factions, and so were undone along with their country." And Diogenes the Babylonian gave the same account of them, in the first book of his Laws. And Antiphanes, speaking generally of the luxury of all the Ionians, has the following lines in his Dodona:- 
  Say, from what country do you come, what land 
  Call you your home? Is this a delicate 
  Luxurious band of long and soft-robed men 
  From cities of Ionia that here approaches?

And Theophrastus, in his essay on Pleasure, says that the Ionians, on account of the extraordinary height to which they carried their luxury, (?) gave rise to what is now known as the golden proverb.

[32.] G   And Theopompus, in the eighth book of his History of the Affairs of Philip, says that some of those tribes which live on the sea-coast are exceedingly luxurious in their manner of living. But about the inhabitants of Byzantium and Chalcedon, the same Theopompus makes the following statement:- "But the Byzantians, because they had been governed a long time by a democracy, and because their city was so situated as to be a kind of trading-post, and because the whole people spent the whole of their time in the market-place and about the harbour, were very intemperate, and in the constant habit of feasting and drinking at the taverns. But the Chalcedonians, before they became members of the same city with them, were men who at all times cultivated better habits and principles of life; but after they had tasted of the democracy of the Byzantians, they fell into ruinous luxury, and, from having been most temperate and moderate in their daily life, they became a nation of hard drinkers, and very extravagant." And, in the twenty-first book of the History of the Affairs of Philip, he says that the nation of the Umbrians (and that is a tribe which lives on the shores of the Adriatic sea) was exceedingly devoted to luxury, and lived in a manner very like the Lydians, and had a fertile country, [527] owing to which they advanced in prosperity.

[33.] G   But speaking about the Thessalians, in his fourth book, he says that "they spend all their time among dancing women and flute-playing women, and some spend all the day in dice and drinking, and similar pastimes; and they are more anxious how they may display their tables loaded with all kinds of food, than how they may exhibit a regular and orderly life. But the Pharsalians," says he, "are of all men the most indolent and the most extravagant." And the Thessalians are agreed (as Critias says) to be the most extravagant of all the Greeks, both in their way of living and in their apparel; which was a reason why they conducted the Persians into Greece, desiring to copy their luxury and expense.

But concerning the Aetolians, Polybius tells us, in the thirteenth book of his History [ 13.1 ], that on account of their continual wars, and the extravagance of their lives, they became involved in debt. And Agatharchides, in the twelfth book of his Histories, says- "The Aetolians are so much the more ready to encounter death, in proportion as they seek to live extravagantly and with greater prodigality than any other nation."

[34.] G   But the Sicilians, and especially the Syracusans, are very notorious for their luxury; as Aristophanes also tells us, in his Daitaleis, where he says- 
  But after that I sent you, you did not 
  Learn this at all; but only learnt to drink, 
  And sing loose songs at Syracusan feasts, 
  And how to share in Sybaritic banquets, 
  And to drink Chian wine in Spartan cups.

But Plato, in his Letters [ 7.326'b ], says- "It was with this intention that I went to Italy and Sicily, when I paid my first visit there. But when I got there, the way of life that I found there was not at all pleasing to me; for twice in the day they eat to satiety, and they never sleep alone at night; and they indulge also in all other such practices as naturally follow on such habits: for, after such habits as these, no man in all the world, who has been bred up in them from his youth, can possibly turn out sensible; and as for being temperate and virtuous, that none of them ever think of." And in the third book of his Republic [ 404'd ] he writes as follows:- "It seems to me, my friend, that you do not approve of the Syracusan tables, and the Sicilian variety of dishes; and you do not approve either of men, who wish to preserve a vigorous constitution, devoting themselves to Corinthian mistresses; nor do you much admire the delicacy which is usually attributed to Athenian sweetmeats."

[35.] G   But Poseidonius, in the sixteenth book of his Histories [ Fr_10 ], speaking of the cities in Syria, and saying how luxurious they were, writes as follows:- "The inhabitants of the towns, on account of the great fertility of the land, used to derive great revenues from their estates, and after their labours for necessary things used to celebrate frequent entertainments, at which they feasted incessantly, using their gymnasia for baths, and anointing themselves with very costly oils and perfumes; and they passed all their time in their ??????????, for that was the name which they gave to their public banqueting-rooms, as if they had been their own private houses; and the greater part of the day they remained in them, filling their bellies with meat and drink, so as even to carry away a good deal to eat at home; and they delighted their ears with the music of a noisy lyre, so that whole cities resounded with such noises." But Agatharchides, in the thirty-fifth book of his Affairs of Europe, says- [528]  # "The Arycandians of Lycia, being neighbours of the Limyres, having got involved in debt, on account of the intemperance and extravagance of their way of living, and, by reason of their indolence and devotion to pleasure, being unable to discharge their debts, placed all their hopes on Mithridates, thinking that he would reward them with a general abolition of debts." And, in his thirty-first book, he says that the Zacynthians were inexperienced in war, because they were accustomed to live in ease and opulence.

[36.] G   #  And Polybius, in his seventh book, says, that the inhabitants of Capua in Campania, having become exceedingly rich through the excellence of their soil, fell into habits of luxury and extravagance, exceeding all that is reported of the inhabitants of Croton or Sybaris. "Accordingly," says he, "they, not being able to bear their present prosperity, called in Hannibal, owing to which act they afterwards suffered intolerable calamities at the hands of the Romans. But the people of Petelia, who kept the promises which they had made to the Romans, behaved with such resolution and fortitude when besieged by Hannibal, that they did not surrender till they had eaten all the hides which there were in the city, and the bark and young branches of all the trees which grew in the city, and till they had endured a siege for eleven months, without any one coming to their assistance; and they did not even then surrender without the permission of the Romans."

[37.] G   And Phylarchus, in the eleventh book of his History [ Fr_23 ], says that Aeschylus says that the Curetes derived their name from their luxurious habits- 
  And their luxurious curls, like a fond girl's 
  On which account they called them ????????.

And Agathon in his Thyestes says, that "the suitors who courted the daughter of Pronax came sumptuously dressed in all other points, and also with very long, carefully dressed hair. And when they failed in obtaining her hand- 
  At least (say they) we cut and dressed our hair, 
  To be an evidence of our luxury, 
  A lovely action of a cheerful mind; 
  And thence we gained the glory of a name,- 
  To be ????????, from our well-cut (????????) hair."

And the people of Cumae in Italy, as Hyperochus tells us, or whoever else it was who wrote the History of Cumae which is attributed to him, wore golden brocaded garments all day, and robes embroidered with flowers; and used to go to the fields with their wives, riding in chariots.- And this is what I have to say about the luxury of nations and cities.

  * * * * *

[50.] G   [535] And Duris says, in the twenty-second book of his History,- "Pausanias, the king of Lacedaemon, having laid aside the national cloak of Lacedaemon, adopted the Persian dress. And Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, adopted a theatrical robe and a golden tragic crown with a clasp. And Alexander, when he became master of Asia, also adopted the Persian dress.  # But Demetrius outdid them all; for the very shoes which he wore he had made in a most costly manner; for in its form it was a kind of buskin, made of most expensive purple wool; and on this the makers wove a great deal of golden embroidery, both before and behind; and his cloak was of a brilliant tawny colour; and, in short, a representation of the heavens was woven into it, having the stars and twelve signs of the Zodiac all wrought in gold; [536] and his head-band was spangled all over with gold, binding on a purple broad-brimmed hat (causia) in such a manner that the outer fringes hung down the back. And when the Demetrian festival was celebrated at Athens, Demetrius himself was painted on the proscenium, sitting on the world." And Nymphis of Heracleia, in the sixth book of his treatise on his Country, says- "Pausanias, who defeated Mardonius at Plataea, having transgressed the laws of Sparta, and given himself up to pride, when staying near Byzantium, dared to put an inscription on the bronze bowl which is there consecrated to the gods, whose temple is at the entrance of the strait, (and the bowl is in existence to this day,) as if he had dedicated it himself; putting this inscription on it, forgetting himself through his luxury and arrogance:- 
  Pausanias, the general of broad Greece, 
  Offered this bowl to the royal Poseidon, 
  A fit memorial of his deathless valour, 
  Here in the Euxine sea. He was by birth 
  A Spartan, and Cleombrotus' son, 
  Sprung from the ancient race of Heracles."

[51.] G   "Pharax the Lacedaemonian also indulged himself in luxury," as Theopompus tells us in the fourteenth book of his History, "and he abandoned himself to pleasure in so dissolute and unrestrained a manner, that by reason of his intemperance he was more often taken for a Sicilian, than for a Spartan by reason of his place of birth." And in his fifty-second book he says that "Archidamus the Lacedaemonian, having abandoned his national customs, adopted foreign and effeminate habits; so that he could not endure the way of life which existed in his own country, but was always, by reason of his intemperance, anxious to live in foreign countries. And when the Tarentines sent an embassy about an alliance, he was anxious to go out with them as an ally; and being there, and having been slain in the wars, he was not thought worthy even of a burial, although the Tarentines offered a great deal of money to the enemy to be allowed to take up his body." And Phylarchus, in the tenth book of his Histories [ Fr_20 ], says that Isanthes was the king of that tribe of Thracians called Crobyzi, and that he surpassed all the men of his time in luxury; and he was a rich man, and very handsome. And the same historian tells us, in his twenty-second book [ Fr_40 ], that Ptolemy the Second, king of Egypt, the most admirable of all princes, and the most learned and accomplished of men, was so beguiled and debased in his mind by his unseasonable luxury, that he actually dreamed that he should live for ever, and said that he alone had found out how to become immortal. And once, after he had been afflicted by the gout for many days, when at last he got a little better, and saw through his window-blinds some Egyptians dining by the river-side, and eating whatever it might be that they had, and lying at random on the sand, "O wretched man that I am," said he, "that I am not one of those men!"

[52.] G   Now Callias and his flatterers we have already sufficiently mentioned. But since Heracleides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasures, speaks of him, we will return to the subject and quote what he says:- "When first the Persians made an expedition against Greece, there was, as they say, an Eretrian of the name of Diomnestus, who became master of all the treasures of the general; for he happened to have pitched his tent in his field, and to have put his money away in some room of his house. But when the Persians were all destroyed, [537] then Diomnestus took the money without any one being aware of it; but when the king of Persia sent an army into Eretria the second time, ordering his generals utterly to destroy the city, then, as was natural, all who were at all well off carried away their treasures. Accordingly those of the family of Diomnestus who were left, secretly removed their money to Athens, to the house of Hipponicus, the son of Callias, who was surnamed Ammon; and when all the Eretrians had been driven out of their city by the Persians, this family remained still in possession of their wealth, which was great. So Hipponicus, who was the descendant of that man who had originally received the deposit, begged the Athenians to grant him a place in the Acropolis, where he might construct a room to store up all this money in, saying that it was not safe for such vast sums to remain in a private house. And the Athenians did grant him such a place; but afterwards, he, being warned against such a step by his friends, changed his mind. Callias, therefore, became the master of all this money, and lived a life of pleasure, (for what limit was there to the flatterers who surrounded him, or to the troops of companions who were always about him? and what extravagance was there which he did not think nothing of ?) However, his voluptuous life afterwards reduced him so low, that he was compelled to pass the rest of his life with one barbarian old woman for a servant, and he lacked even the most basic necessities, and so he died. But who was it who got rid of the riches of Nicias of Pergas?, or of Ischomachus? was it not Autocle?s and Epicle?s, who preferred living with one another, and who considered everything second to pleasure? and after they had squandered all this wealth, they drank hemlock together, and so perished."

[53.] G   But, concerning the luxury of Alexander the Great, Ephippus the Olynthian, in his treatise on the Deaths of Alexander and Hephaestion, says that "he had in his park a golden throne, and couches with silver feet, on which he used to sit and transact business with his companions." But Nicobul? says, that "while he was at supper all the performers and athletes made an effort to entertain the king; and at his very last banquet, Alexander, remembering an episode in the Andromeda of Euripides, recited it in a declamatory manner, and then drank a cup of unmixed wine with great eagerness, and compelled all the rest to do so too." And Ephippus tells us that "Alexander used to wear even the sacred vestments at his banquets; and sometimes he would wear the purple robe, and slit sandals, and horns of Ammon, as if he had been the god; and sometimes he would imitate Artemis, whose dress he often wore while driving in his chariot; having on also a Persian robe, but displaying above his shoulders the bow and javelin of the goddess. Sometimes also he would appear in the guise of Hermes; at other times, and indeed almost every day, he would wear a purple cloak, and a tunic shot with white, and a hat (causia) which had a royal diadem attached to it. And when he was in private with his friends he wore the sandals of Hermes, and the petasus on his head, and held the caduceus in his hand. Often also he wore a lion's skin, and carried a club, like Heracles." What wonder then is it, if in our time the emperor Commodus, when he drove abroad in his chariot, had the club of Heracles lying beside him, with a lion's skin spread at his feet, and liked to be called Heracles, when even Alexander, the pupil of Aristotle, represented himself as like so many gods, and even like Artemis? And Alexander used to have the floor sprinkled with exquisite perfumes and with fragrant wine; [538] and myrrh was burnt before him, and other kinds of incense; and all the bystanders kept silence, or spoke only words of good omen, out of fear. For he was a very violent man, with no regard for human life; for he appeared to be a man of a melancholic constitution. And on one occasion, at Ecbatana, he offered a sacrifice to Dionysus, and everything was prepared in a most lavish manner for the banquet, and Satrabates the satrap, feasted all the soldiers. "But when a great multitude was collected to see the spectacle," says Ephippus, "there were on a sudden some arrogant proclamations published, more insolent even than Persian arrogance was wont to dictate. For, as different people were publishing different proclamations, and proposing to make Alexander large presents, which they called crowns, one of the keepers of his armoury, going beyond all previous flattery, having previously arranged the matter with Alexander, ordered the herald to proclaim that Gorgus, the keeper of the armoury, presents Alexander, the son of Ammon, with three thousand pieces of gold; and will also present him, when he lays siege to Athens, with ten thousand complete suits of armour, and with an equal number of catapults and all weapons required for the war.

[54.] G   And Chares, in the tenth book of his History of Alexander, says- "When he took Dareius prisoner, he celebrated a marriage-feast for himself and his companions, having had ninety-two bedchambers prepared in the same place. There was a house built capable of containing a hundred couches; and in it every couch was adorned with wedding paraphernalia to the value of twenty minae, and was made of silver itself; but his own bed had golden feet. And he also invited to the banquet which be gave, all his own private friends, and those he arranged opposite to himself and the other bridegrooms; and his forces also belonging to the army and navy, and all the ambassadors which were present, and all the other strangers who were staying at his court. And the apartment was furnished in the most costly and magnificent manner, with sumptuous garments and cloths, and beneath them were other cloths of purple, and scarlet, and gold. And, for the sake of solidity, pillars supported the tent, each twenty cubits long, plated all over with gold and silver, and inlaid with precious stones; and all around these were spread costly curtains embroidered with figures of animals, and with gold, having gold and silver curtain-rods. And the circumference of the court was four stades. And the banquet took place, beginning at the sound of a trumpet, at that marriage feast, and on other occasions whenever the king offered a solemn sacrifice, so that all the army knew it. And, this marriage feast lasted five days. And a great number both of barbarians and Greeks brought contributions to it; and also some of the Indian tribes did so. And there were present some wonderful conjurors - Scymnus of Tarentum, and Philistides of Syracuse, and Heracleitus of Mytilene; after whom also Alexis of Tarentum, the rhapsodist, exhibited his skill. There came also harp-players, who played without singing,- Cratinus of Methymna, and Aristonymus the Athenian, and Athenodorus of Teos.  And Heracleitus of Tarentum played on the harp, accompanying himself with his voice, and so did Aristocrates the Theban. And of flute-players accompanied with song, there were present Dionysius of Heracleia, and Hyperbolus of Cyzicus. And of other flute-players there were the following, who first of all played the Pythian melody, and afterwards played with the choruses,- Timotheus, Phrynichus, Caphesias, Diophantus, and also Evius the Chalcidian. And from this time forward, those who were formerly called Dionysius-flatterers, were called Alexander-flatterers, on account of the extravagant liberality of their presents, with which Alexander was pleased. And there were also tragedians who acted,- Thessalus, and Athenodorus, and Aristocritus; [539] and of comic actors there were Lycon, and Phormion, and Ariston. There was also Phasimelus the harp-player. And the crowns sent by the ambassadors and by other people amounted in value to fifteen thousand talents.

[55.] G   But Polycleitus of Larissa, in the eighth book of his History, says that Alexander used to sleep on a golden couch, and that flute-playing men and women followed him to the camp, and that he used to drink till daybreak. And Clearchus, in his treatise on Lives, speaking of Dareius who was dethroned by Alexander, says, "The king of the Persians offered prizes to those who could invent pleasures for him, and by this conduct allowed his whole empire and sovereignty to be subverted by pleasures. Nor was he aware that he was defeating himself till others had wrested his sceptre from him and had been proclaimed in his place." And Phylarchus, in the twenty-third book of his History [ Fr_41 ], and Agatharchides of Cnidus, in the tenth book of his History of Asia, say that the companions also of Alexander gave way to the most extravagant luxury. And one of them was a man named Agnon, who used to wear golden studs in his sandals and shoes. And Cleitus, who was surnamed The White, whenever he was about to transact business, used to converse with every one who came to him while walking about on a purple carpet. And Perdiccas and Craterus, who were fond of athletic exercises, had men follow them with hides fastened together, so as to cover a place an entire stade in extent; and then they selected a spot within the encampment which they had covered with these skins as an awning; and under this they practised their gymnastics. They were followed also by numerous beasts of burden, which carried sand for the use of the palaestra. And Leonnatus and Menelaus, who were very fond of hunting, had curtains brought after them calculated to enclose a space a hundred stades in circumference, with which they fenced in a large space and then practised hunting within it. And as for the golden plane-trees, and the golden vine - having on it bunches of grapes made of emeralds and Indian carbuncles, and all sorts of other stones of the most costly and magnificent description, under which the kings of Persia used often to sit when transacting business,- the expense of all this, says Phylarchus, was far less than the daily sums squandered by Alexander; for he had a tent capable of containing a hundred couches, and fifty golden pillars supported it. And over it were spread golden canopies wrought with the most superb and costly embroidery, to shade all the upper part of it. And first of all, five hundred Persian Melophori stood all round the inside of it, clad in robes of purple and apple-green; and besides them there were bowmen to the number of a thousand, some clad in garments of a fiery red, and others in purple; and many of them had blue cloaks. And in front of them stood five hundred Macedonian Argyraspides; and in the middle of the tent was placed a golden chair, on which Alexander used to sit and transact business, his body-guards standing all around. And on the outside, and round the tent, was a troop of elephants regularly equipped, and a thousand Macedonians, in Macedonian uniform; and then ten thousand Persians: and the number of those who wore purple amounted to five hundred, to whom Alexander gave this clothing for them to wear. And though he had such a numerous retinue of friends and servants, still no one dared to approach Alexander of his own accord; so great was his dignity and the veneration with which they regarded him. And at that time Alexander wrote letters to the cities in Ionia, and to the Chians first of all, to send him a quantity of purple; [540] for he wished all his companions to wear purple robes. And when his letter was read among the Chians, Theocritus the philosopher being present, said that now he understood the verse in Homer [ Il_5'83 ] - 
  He fell by purple death and mighty fate.

[56.] G   #  And Poseidonius, in the twenty-eighth book of his History [ Fr_21 ], says that "Antiochus the king, who was surnamed Grypus, when he was celebrating the games at Daphne, gave a magnificent banquet; at which, first of all, a distribution of entire joints took place, and after that another distribution of geese, and hares, and antelopes all alive. There were also," says he, "distributed golden crowns to the feasters, and a great quantity of silver plate, and of servants, and horses, and camels. And every one was expected to mount a camel, and drink; and after that he was presented with the camel, and with all that was on the camel, and the boy who stood by it."  # And in his fourteenth book [ Fr_9 ], speaking of his namesake Antiochus, who made war upon Arsaces, and invaded Media, he says that "he made a feast for a great multitude every day; at which, besides the things which were consumed, and the heaps of fragments which were left, every one of the guests carried away with him entire joints of beasts, and birds, and fishes which had never been carved, all ready dressed, in sufficient quantities to fill a wagon. And after this they were presented with a quantity of honey-cakes, and chaplets, and crowns of myrrh and frankincense, with turbans as long as a man, made of strips of gold brocade.

[57.] G   But Clytus, the pupil of Aristotle, in his History of Miletus, says that "Polycrates, the tyrant of Samos, collected everything that was worth speaking of everywhere to gratify his luxury, having assembled dogs from Epirus, and goats from Scyros, and sheep from Miletus, and swine from Sicily." And Alexis, in the third book of his Samian Annals, says- that "Samos was adorned by Polycrates with the productions of many other cities; as he imported Molossian and Lacedaemonian dogs, and goats from Scyros and Naxos, and sheep from Miletus and Attica. He also," says he, "sent for artists, promising them enormous wages. But before he became tyrant, having prepared a number of costly couches and goblets, he allowed any one the use of them who was preparing any marriage-feast or extraordinary entertainment." And after hearing all these particulars we may well admire the tyrant, because it was nowhere written that he had sent for any women or boys from any other countries, although he was of a very amorous nature, and was a rival in love of Anacreon the poet; and once, in a fit of jealousy, he cut off all the hair of the object of his passion. And Polycrates was the first man who called the ships which he had built Samians, in honour of his country.

But Clearchus says that "Polycrates, the tyrant of the effeminate Samos, was ruined by the intemperance of his life, imitating the effeminate practices of the Lydians; on which account, in opposition to the place in Sardis called the beautiful Ancon, he prepared a place in the chief city of the Samians, called Laura; he made those famous Samian flowers in opposition to the Lydian. And the Samian Laura was a narrow street in the city, full of common women, and of all kinds of food calculated to gratify intemperance and to promote enjoyment, with which things he actually filled Greece. [541] But the flowers of the Samians are the pre-eminent beauty of the men and women, and indeed of the whole city, at its festivals and banquets." And these are the words of Clearchus. And I myself am acquainted with a narrow street in my native city of Alexandria, which to this very day is called the Happy Street, in which every apparatus of luxury used to be sold.

[58.] G   But Aristotle, in his treatise on Admirable and Wonderful Things, says that "Alcisthenes of Sybaris, out of luxury, had a garment prepared for him of such excessive expensiveness that he exhibited it at Lacinium, at the festival of Hera, at which all the Italians assemble, and that of all the things which were exhibited that was the most admired." And he says that "Dionysius the elder afterwards took possession of it, and sold it to the Carthaginians for a hundred and twenty talents." Polemon also speaks of it in his book entitled, A Treatise concerning the Sacred Garments at Carthage. But concerning Smindyrides of Sybaris, and his luxury, Herodotus has told us, in his sixth book [ 6.126 ], saying that he sailed from Sybaris to court Agariste, the daughter of Cleisthenes the tyrant of Sicyon. "And," says he, "there came from Italy Smindyrides, the son of Hippocrates, a citizen of Sybaris; who carried his luxury to the greatest height that ever was heard of among men. At all events he was attended by a thousand cooks and bird-catchers." Timaeus also mentions him in his seventh book.

But of the luxury of Dionysius the younger, who was also tyrant of Sicily, an account is given by Satyrus the Peripatetic, in his Lives. For he says that he used to fill rooms holding thirty couches with feasters. And Clearchus, in the fourth book of his Lives, writes as follows:- "But Dionysius, the son of Dionysius, the cruel oppressor of all Sicily, when he came to the city of the Locrians, which was his metropolis, (for Doris his mother was a Locrian woman by birth,) having strewed the floor of the largest house in the city with wild thyme and roses, sent for all the maidens of the Locrians in turn; and then rolled about naked, with them naked also, on this layer of flowers, omitting no circumstance of infamy. And so, not long afterwards, they who had been insulted in this manner having got his wife and children into their power, prostituted them in the public roads with great insult, sparing them no kind of degradation. And when they had wreaked their vengeance upon them, they thrust needles under the nails of their fingers, and put them to death with torture. And when they were dead, they pounded their bones in mortars, and having cut up and distributed the rest of their flesh, they imprecated curses on all who did not eat of it; and in accordance with this unholy imprecation, they put their flesh into the mills with the flour, that it might be eaten by all those who made bread. And all the other parts they sunk in the sea. But Dionysius himself, at last going about as a begging priest of Cybele, and beating the drum, ended his life very miserably. We, therefore, ought to guard against what is called luxury, which is the ruin of a man's life; and we ought to think insolence the destruction of everything."

[59.] G   But Diodorus Siculus, in his Historical Library [ 11.25 ], says that "the citizens of Acragas prepared for Gelon a very costly swimming-bath, being seven stades in circumference and twenty cubits deep; and water was introduced into it from the rivers and fountains, and it served for a great pond to breed fish in, and supplied great quantities of fish for the luxury and enjoyment of Gelon. A great number of swans also," as he relates, "flew into it; so that it was a very beautiful sight. But afterwards the lake was destroyed by becoming filled with mud." [542] And Duris, in the (?) fourth book of his History of Agathocles, says that near the city of Hipponium a grove is shown of extraordinary beauty, excellently well watered; in which there is also a place called the Horn of Amaltheia; and that this grove was made by Gelon. But Silenus of Calatia, in the third book of his History of Sicily, says that near Syracuse there is a garden laid out in a most expensive manner, which is called Mythus, in which Hieron the king used to transact his business. And the whole country about Panormus in Sicily is called The Garden, because it is full of highly-cultivated trees, as Callias tells us in the eighth book of his History of Agathocles.

#  And Poseidonius, in the eighth book of his History [ Fr_7 ], speaking of Damophilus the Sicilian, by whose means it was that the Servile war was stirred up, and saying that he was a slave to his luxury, writes as follows:- "He therefore was a slave to luxury and debauchery. And he used to drive through the country on a four-wheeled chariot, taking with him horses, and servants of great personal beauty, and a disorderly crowd of flatterers and military boys running around his chariot. And ultimately he, with his whole family, perished in a disgraceful manner, being treated with the most extreme violence and insult by his own slaves.

[60.] G   #  And Demetrius Phalereus, as Duris says in the sixteenth volume of his Histories, being possessed of a revenue of twelve hundred talents a year, and spending a small portion of it on his soldiers, and on the necessary expenses of the state, squandered all the rest of it on gratifying his innate love of debauchery, having splendid banquets every day, and a great number of guests to feast with him. And in the prodigality of his expense in his entertainments, he outdid even the Macedonians, and, at the same time, in the elegance of them, he surpassed the Cyprians and Phoenicians. And perfumes were sprinkled over the ground, and many of the floors in the men's apartments were inlaid with flowers, and were exquisitely wrought in other ways by the artists. There were also secret meetings with women, and other scenes more shameful still. And Demetrius, who gave laws to others, and who regulated the lives of others, exhibited in his own life an utter contempt of all law. He also paid great attention to his personal appearance, and dyed the hair of his head with a yellow colour, and anointed his face with rouge, and smeared himself over with other unguents also; for he was anxious to appear agreeable and beautiful in the eyes of all whom he met.

 # And in the procession of the Dionysia, which he celebrated when he was archon at Athens, a chorus sang an ode of Castorion of Soli, addressed to him, in which he was called, "like the sun": 
  And above all the noble prince 
  Demetrius, like the sun in face, 
  Honours you [Dionysus] with a holy worship.

And Carystius of Pergamum, in the third book of his Commentaries, says- "Demetrius Phalereus, when his brother Himeraeus was put to death by Antipater, was himself staying with Nicanor; and he was accused of having sacrificed the Epiphaneia in honour of his brother. And after he became a friend of Cassander, he was very powerful. And at first his dinner consisted of a kind of pickle, containing olives from all countries, and cheese from the islands; but when he became rich, he bought Moschion, the most skilful of all the cooks and confectioners of that age. And he had such vast quantities of food prepared for him every day, that, as he gave Moschion what was left each day, he (Moschion) in two years purchased three detached houses in the city; and insulted free-born boys, and some of the wives of the most eminent of the citizens: and all the boys envied Theognis, with whom he was in love. And so important an honour was it considered to be allowed to come near Demetrius, that, as he one day had walked about after dinner near the Tripods, [543] on all the following days all the most beautiful boys came together to that place, in the hopes of being seen by him."

[61.] G    # And Nicolaus the Peripatetic, in the (?) hundred and tenth book of his History, says that Lucullus, after he came to Rome and celebrated his triumph, and gave an account of the war against Mithridates, ran into the most unbounded extravagance, although he had previously been very moderate; and he was altogether the first guide to luxury, and the first example of it, among the Romans, having become master of the riches of two kings, Mithridates and Tigranes. And Sittius, also, was a man very notorious among the Romans for his luxury and effeminacy, as Rutilius tells us; for as to Apicius, we have already spoken of him. And almost all historians relate that Pausanias and Lysander were very notorious for their luxury; on which account Agis said of Lysander, that Sparta had produced him as a second Pausanias. But Theopompus, in the tenth book of his History of the Affairs of Greece, gives exactly the contrary account of Lysander, saying that "he was a most hard-working man, able to earn the goodwill of both private individuals and monarchs, being very moderate and temperate, and unaffected by all the allurements of pleasure; and accordingly, when he had become master of almost the whole of Greece, it will be found that he never in any city indulged in lustful excesses, or in unreasonable drinking parties and revels."

[62.] G   But luxury and extravagance were so very much practised among the ancients, that even Parrhasius the painter always wore a purple robe, and a golden crown on his head, as Clearchus relates, in his Lives: for he, being most immoderately luxurious, and also to a degree beyond what was becoming to a painter, laid claim, in words, to great virtue, and inscribed upon the works which were done by him- 
  Parrhasius, a most luxurious (???????????) man, 
  And yet a follower of purest virtue, 
  Painted this work. 
But some one else, being indignant at this inscription, wrote by the side of it, ???????????? (worthy of a stick).

Parrhasius also put the following inscription on many of his works: 
  Parrhasius, a most luxurious man, 
  And yet a follower of purest virtue, 
  Painted this work: a worthy citizen 
  Of noble Ephesus. His father's name 
  Euenor was, and he, his lawful son, 
  Was the foremost artist in all of Greece.

He also boasted, in a way which no one could be indignant at, in the following lines: 
  This will I say, though strange it may appear, 
  That clear plain limits of this noble art 
  Have been discovered by my hand, and proved. 
  And now the boundary which none can pass 
  Is well defined, though nought that men can do 
  Will ever wholly escape blame or envy.

And once, at Samos, when he was contending with a very inferior painter in a picture of Ajax, and was defeated, when his friends were sympathising with him and expressing their indignation, he said that he himself cared very little about it, but that he was sorry for Ajax, who was thus defeated a second time. And so great was his luxury, that he wore a purple robe, and a white turban on his head; and used to lean on a stick, ornamented all round with golden fretted work: and he used even to fasten the strings of his sandals with golden clasps. However, as regarded his art, he was not churlish or ill-tempered, but affable and good-humoured; so that he sang all the time that he was painting, as Theophrastus relates, in his treatise on Happiness. But once he spoke in a marvellously solemn strain, when he said, when he was painting the Heracles at Lindus, that the god had appeared to him in a dream, in that form and dress which was the best adapted for painting; on which account he inscribed on the picture- 
  [544] Here you may see the god as oft he stood 
  Before Parrhasius in his sleep by night.

[63.] G   [544] We find also whole schools of philosophers which have openly professed to have made choice of pleasure. And there is the school called the Cyrenaic, which derives its origin from Aristippus the pupil of Socrates: and he devoted himself to pleasure in such a way, that he said that it was the main end of life; and that happiness was founded on it, and that happiness was at best but short-lived. And he, like the most debauched of men, thought that he had nothing to do either with the recollection of past enjoyments, or with the hope of future ones; but he judged of all good by the present alone, and thought that having enjoyed, and being about to enjoy, did not at all concern him; since the one case had no longer any existence, and the other did not yet exist and was necessarily uncertain: acting in this respect like thoroughly dissolute men, who are content with being prosperous at the present moment. And his life was quite consistent with his theory; for he spent the whole of it in all kinds of luxury and extravagance, both in perfumes, and dress, and women. Accordingly, he openly kept Lais as his mistress; and he delighted in all the extravagance of Dionysius, although he was often treated insultingly by him.

Accordingly, Hegesander says that once, when he was assigned a very mean place at a banquet by Dionysius, he endured it patiently; and when Dionysius asked him what he thought of his present place, in comparison of his yesterday's seat, he said, "That the one was much the same as the other; for that one," says he, "is a mean seat today, because it is deprived of me; but it was yesterday the most respectable seat in the room, owing to me: and this one today has become respectable, because of my presence in it; but yesterday it was an inglorious seat, as I was not present in it." And in another place Hegesander says- "Aristippus, being ducked with water by Dionysius' servants, and being ridiculed by Antiphon for bearing it patiently, said, 'But suppose I had been out fishing, and got wet, was I to have left my employment, and come away?' " And Aristippus stayed a considerable time in Aegina, indulging in every kind of luxury; on which account Xenophon says in his Memorabilia [ 2.1 ], that Socrates often reproved him, and invented the parable of Virtue and Pleasure to apply it to him. And Aristippus said, respecting Lais, "I have her, and I am not possessed by her." And when he was at the court of Dionysius, he once had a quarrel with some people about a choice of three women. And he used to wash with perfumes, and to say that [ Euripides, Bacch_317 ] - 
  Even in the midst of Bacchanalian revels 
  A modest woman will not be corrupted.

And Alexis, turning him into ridicule in his Galateia, represents one of the slaves as speaking in the following manner of one of his disciples: 
  For this my master once did turn his thoughts 
  To study, when he was a stripling young, 
  And set his mind to learn philosophy. 
  And then a Cyrenaean, as he calls himself, 
  Named Aristippus, an ingenious sophist, 
  And far the first of all the men of his time, 
  But also far the most intemperate, 
  Was in the city. Him my master sought, 
  Giving a talent to become his pupil: 
  He did not learn, indeed, much skill or wisdom, 
  But got instead a sad complaint on his chest.

And Antiphanes, in his Antaeus, speaking of the luxurious habits of the philosophers, says- 
  My friend, now do you know who this old man 
  Is called? By his look he seems to be a Greek. 
  [545] His cloak is white, his tunic fawn-coloured 
  His hat is soft, his stick of moderate size, 
  His table scanty. Why need I say more, 
  I seem to see the genuine Academy.

[64.] G   And Aristoxenus the musician, in his Life of Archytas, represents ambassadors as having been sent by Dionysius the younger to the city of the Tarentines, among whom was Polyarchus, who was surnamed the Luxurious, a man wholly devoted to sensual pleasures, not only in deed, but in word and profession also. And he was a friend of Archytas, and not wholly unversed in philosophy; and so he used to come with him into the sacred precincts, and to walk with him and with his friends, listening to his lectures and arguments: and once, when there was a long dispute and discussion about the passions, and altogether about sensual pleasures, Polyarchus said- "I, indeed, my friends, have often considered the matter, and it has seemed to me that this system of the virtues is altogether a long way removed from nature; for nature, when it utters its own voice, orders one to follow pleasure, and says that this is the conduct of a wise man: but that to oppose it, and to bring one's appetites into a state of slavery, is neither the part of a wise man, nor of a fortunate man, nor indeed of one who has any accurate understanding of what the constitution of human nature really is. And it is a strong proof of this, that all men, when they have acquired any power worth speaking of, betake themselves to sensual pleasures, and think the power of indulging them the principal advantage to be gained from the possession of power, and everything else, so to say, as unimportant and superfluous. And we may adduce the example of the Persian king at present, and every other tyrant possessed of any power worth speaking of,- and in former times, the sovereigns of the Lydians and of the Medes,- and even in earlier times still, the tyrants of the [Assyrians] behaved in the same manner; for all these men left no kind of pleasure unexplored: and it is even said that rewards were offered by the Persians to any one who was able to invent a new pleasure. And it was a very wise offer to make; for the nature of man is soon satiated with long-continued pleasures, even if they be of a very exquisite nature. So that, since novelty has a very great effect in making a pleasure appear greater, we must not despise it, but rather pay great attention to it. And on this account it is that many different kinds of dishes have been invented, and many sorts of cakes; and many discoveries have been made in the articles of incenses and perfumes, and clothes, and beds, and, above all, of cups and other utensils. For all these things contribute some amount of pleasure, when the material which is admired by human nature is properly employed: and this appears to be the case with gold and silver, and with most things which are pleasing to the eye and also rare, and with all things which are elaborated to a high degree of perfection by manual arts and skill."

[65.] G   And having discussed after this all the attendance with which the king of the Persians is surrounded, and what a number of servants he has, and what their different offices are, and also about his amorous indulgences, and also about the sweet perfume of his skin, and his personal beauty, and the way in which he lives among his friends, and the pleasing sights or sounds which are sought out to gratify him, he said that he considered "the king of Persia the happiest of all men now alive. For there are pleasures prepared for him which are both most numerous and most perfect in their kind. And next to him," said he, "any one may fairly rank our sovereign, though he falls far short of the king of Persia. [546] For this latter has all Asia to supply him with luxury, but the store which supplies Dionysius will seem very contemptible if compared with his. That, then, such a life as his is worth struggling for, is plain from what has happened. For the Medes, after encountering the greatest dangers, deprived the [Assyrians] of the supremacy, for no other object except to possess themselves of the unrestrained affluence of the [Assyrians]. And the Persians overthrew the Medes for the same reason, namely, in order to have an unrestrained enjoyment of sensual pleasures. And the lawgivers who wish the whole race of men to be on an equality, and that no citizens shall indulge in superfluous luxury, have made some species of virtue hold its head up. And they have written laws about contracts and other matters of the same kind, and whatever appeared to be necessary for relationships within the state, and also with respect to dress, and to all the other circumstances of life, that they should be similar among all the citizens. And so, as all the lawgivers made war upon every kind of covetousness, then first the praises of justice began to be more thought of: and one of the poets spoke of- 
  The golden face of justice; 
and in another passage some one speaks of- 
  The golden eye of justice.

And the very name of justice came to be accounted divine, so that in some countries there were altars erected and sacrifices instituted to Justice. And next to this they inculcated a respect for modesty and temperance, and called an excess in enjoyment covetousness; so that a man who obeyed the laws and was influenced by the common conversation of men in general, was necessarily moderate with respect to sensual pleasures."

[66.] G   And Duris says, in the twenty-third volume of his History, that in ancient times the nobles had a definite fondness for getting drunk. On which account Homer represents Achilles as reproaching Agamemnon, and saying [ Il_1'225 ]- 
  O thou whose senses are all dimmed with wine, 
  Thou dog in forehead.

And when he is describing the death of the king he makes Agamemnon say [ Od_11'419 ]- 
  Even in my mirth, and at the friendly feast, 
  Over the full bowl the traitor stabbed his guest; 
pointing out that his death was partly caused by his fondness for drunkenness.

Speusippus also, the relation of Plato, and his successor in his school, was a man very fond of pleasure. At all events Dionysius, the tyrant of Sicily, in his letter to him blaming him for his fondness for pleasure, reproaches him also for his covetousness, and for his love of Lastheneia the Arcadian, who had been a pupil of Plato.

[67.] G   But not only did Aristippus and his followers embrace that pleasure which consists in motion, but also Epicurus and his followers did the same. And not to say anything of those sudden motions, and irritations, and titillations, and also those ticklings and stimuli which Epicurus often brings forward, I will merely cite what he has said in his treatise on the End. For he says- "For I am not able to perceive any good, if I take away all the pleasures which arise from flavours, and if I leave out of the question all the pleasures arising from amorous indulgences, and all those which are caused by hearing sweet sounds, and all those motions which are excited by figures which are pleasant to the sight." And Metrodorus in his Epistles says- "My good natural philosopher Timocrates, reason which proceeds according to nature devotes its whole attention to the stomach." And Epicurus says- "The origin and root of all good is the pleasure of the stomach; and all excessive efforts of wisdom have reference to the stomach." And again, in his treatise concerning the End, he says- "You ought therefore to respect honour and the virtues, and all things of that sort, if they produce pleasure; but if they do not, then we may as well have nothing to do with them:" evidently in these words making virtue subordinate to pleasure, and performing as it were the part of a hand-maid to it. [547] And in another place he says- "I spit upon honour, and those who worship it in a foolish manner, when it produces no pleasure."

[68.] G    # Well then did the Romans, who are in every respect the most admirable of men, banish Alcaeus and Philiscus the Epicureans out of their city, when Lucius Postumius was consul, on account of the pleasures which they sought to introduce into the city. And in the same manner the Messenians by a public decree banished the Epicureans. But Antiochus the king banished all the philosophers out of his kingdom, writing thus- "King Antiochus to Phanias: We have written to you before, that no philosopher is to remain in the city, nor in the country. But we hear that there is no small number of them, and that they do great injury to the young men, because you have done none of the things about which we wrote to you. As soon, therefore, as you receive this letter, order a proclamation to be made, that all the philosophers do at once depart from those places, and that as many young men as are detected in going to them, shall be fastened to a pillar and flogged, and their fathers shall be held in great blame. And let not this order be transgressed.

But before Epicurus, Sophocles the poet was a great instigator to pleasure, speaking as follows in his Antigone [ 1165 ] - 
  For when men utterly forsake all pleasure, 
  I reckon such a man no longer living, 
  But look upon him as a breathing corpse. 
  He may have, if you like, great wealth at home, 
  And go in monarch's guise; but if his wealth 
  And power bring no pleasure to his mind, 
  I would not for a moment deem it all 
  Worth the shadow of smoke, compared with pleasure.

[69.] G   #  "And Lycon the Peripatetic," as Antigonus the Carystian says, "when as a young man he had come to Athens for the sake of his education, was most accurately informed about everything relating to banquets and drinking parties, and as to how much pay every courtesan required. But afterwards having become the chief man of the Peripatetic school, he used to entertain his friends at banquets with excessive arrogance and extravagance. For, besides the music which was provided at his entertainments, and the silver plate and coverlets which were exhibited, all the rest of the preparation and the superb character of the dishes was such, and the multitude of tables and cooks was so great, that many people were actually alarmed, and, though they wished to be admitted into his school, shrunk back, fearing to enter, as into a badly governed state, which was always burdening its citizens with the duty of choregus and other expensive offices. For men were compelled to undertake the regular office of manager of the Peripatetic school. And the duties of this office were, to superintend all the new students for thirty days, and see that they behaved appropriately. And then, on the last day of the month, having received nine obols from each of the new students, he received at supper not only all those who contributed their share, but all those also whom Lycon might chance to invite, and also all those of the elders who were diligent in attending the school; so that the money which was collected was not sufficient even for providing sufficient unguents and garlands. He also was bound to perform the sacrifices, and to oversee the rites of the Muses. All which duties appeared to have but little connexion with reason or with philosophy, but to be more akin to luxury and parade. For even if they did not compel any person to spend money on these objects, if he had only very scanty and meagre resources, yet the practice was very harmful. For Plato and Speusippus had not established these entertainments, in order that people might dwell upon the pleasures of dinner from day-break, or for the sake of getting drunk; [548] but in order that men might appear to honour the Deity, and to associate with one another in a natural manner; and chiefly with a view to natural relaxation and conversation; all which things afterwards became in their eyes second to the softness of their garments, and to their indulgence in their before-mentioned extravagance. Nor do I except the rest. For Lycon, to gratify his luxurious and insolent disposition, had a room large enough to hold twenty couches, in the most frequented part of the city, in Conon's house, which was well adapted for him to give parties in. And Lycon was a skilful and clever player at ball."

[70.] G   And of Anaxarchus, Clearchus of Soli writes, in the fifth book of his Lives, in the following manner- "Anaxarchus, who was one of those who called themselves Eudaemonists, after he had become a rich man through the folly of those men who supplied him with means out of their abundance, used to have a naked full-grown girl for his cup-bearer, who was superior in beauty to all her fellows; she, if one is to look at the real truth, thus exposing the intemperance of all those who employed her. And his baker used to knead the dough wearing gloves on his hands, and a cover on his mouth, to prevent any perspiration running off his hands, and also to prevent him from breathing on his cakes while he was kneading them." So that a man might fairly quote to this wise philosopher the verses of Anaxilas in his Harp-maker - 
  And anointing one's skin with a gold-coloured ointment, 
  And wearing long cloaks reaching down to the ground, 
  And the thinnest of slippers, and eating rich truffles, 
  And the richest of cheese, and the newest of eggs; 
  And all sorts of shell-fish, and drinking strong wine 
  From the island of Chios, and having, besides, 
  A lot of Ephesian beautiful letters, 
  In carefully-sewn leather bags.

[71.] G   But how far superior to these men is Gorgias of Leontini; of whom the same Clearchus says, in the eighth book of his Lives, that because of the temperance of his life he lived nearly (?) eighty years in the full possession of all his intellect and faculties. And when some one asked him what his mode of life had been which had caused him to live with such comfort, and to retain such full possession of his senses, he said, "I have never done anything merely for the sake of pleasure." But Demetrius of Byzantium, in the fourth book of his treatise on Poems, says- "Gorgias the Leontine, being once asked by some one what was the cause of his living more than a hundred years, said that it was because he had never done anything to please any one else except himself."  And Ochus, after he had had a long enjoyment of kingly power, and of all the other things which make life pleasant, being asked towards the close of his life by his eldest son, by what course of conduct he had preserved the kingly power for so many years, that he also might imitate it; replied, "By behaving justly towards all men and all gods." And Carystius of Pergamum, in his Historical Commentaries, says- "Cephisodorus the Theban relates that Polydorus the physician of Teos used to live with Antipater, and that the king had a common kind of coarse carpet worked in rings like a coverlet, on which he used to recline; and bronze bowls and only a small number of cups; for that he was a man fond of plain living and averse to luxury."

[72.] G   But the story which we have of Tithonus represents him as a person sleeping from daybreak to sunset, so that his appetites scarcely awakened him by evening. On which account he was said to sleep with Dawn, because he was so wholly enslaved by his appetites. And as he was at a later period of life prevented from indulging them by old age, and being wholly dependent on them, he is (?) shut up in a bird-cage. [549] And Melanthius, stretching out his neck, was choked by his enjoyments, being a greater glutton than the Melanthius of Odysseus. And many other men have destroyed their bodily strength entirely by their unreasonable indulgence; and some have become inordinately fat; and others have become stupid and insensible by reason of their inordinate luxury. Accordingly, Nymphis of Heracleia, in the second book of his History of Heracleia, says "Dionysius the son of Clearchus, who was the first tyrant of Heracleia, and who was himself afterwards tyrant of his country, grew enormously fat without perceiving it, owing to his luxury and to his daily gluttony; so that on account of his obesity he was constantly oppressed by a difficulty of breathing and a feeling of suffocation. On which account his physicians ordered thin needles of an exceedingly great length to be made, to be run into his sides and chest whenever he fell into a deeper sleep than usual. And up to a certain point his flesh was so callous by reason of the fat, that it never felt the needles; but if ever they touched a part that was not so overloaded, then he felt them, and was awakened by them. And he used to give answers to people who came to him, holding a box in front of his body so as to conceal all the rest of his person, and leave only his face visible; and in this condition he conversed with those who came to him."

And Menander also, who was a person as little given to evil-speaking as possible, mentions Dionysius in his Fishermen, introducing some exiles from Heracleia as saying- 
  For a fat pig was lying on his face; 
and in another place he says- 
  He gave himself to luxury so wholly, 
  That he could not last long to practise it; 
and again he says- 
  Forming desires for myself, this death 
  Does seem the only happy one,- to grow 
  Fat in my heart and stomach, and so lie 
  Flat on my back, and never say a word, 
  Drawing my breath high up, eating my fill, 
  And saying, " Here I waste away with pleasure."

And Dionysius died when he was fifty-five years of age, of which he had been tyrant thirty-three, being superior to all the tyrants who had preceded him in gentleness and humanity.

[73.] G   And Ptolemy the Seventh, king of Egypt, was a man of this sort, the same who caused himself to be styled Euergetes ["Benefactor"], but who was called Cacergetes ["Malefactor"] by the Alexandrians.  # Accordingly, Poseidonius the Stoic, who went with Scipio Africanus when he was sent to Alexandria, and who there saw this Ptolemy, writes thus, in the seventh book of his History [ Fr_6 ],- "But owing to his luxury his whole body was eaten up with fat, and with the greatness of his belly, which was so large that no one could put his arms all round it; and he wore over it a tunic which reached down to his feet, having sleeves which reached to his wrists, and he never by any chance walked out except on this occasion of Scipio's visit."  # And that this king was not averse to luxury, he tells us when he speaks of himself, relating, in the eighth book of his Commentaries, how he was priest of Apollo at Cyrene, and how he gave a banquet to those who had been priests before him; writing thus:- "The Artemitia is the great festival of Cyrene, on which occasion the priest of Apollo (and that office is one which lasts a year) gives a banquet to all those who have been his predecessors in the office; and he sets before each of them a separate dish. And this dish is an earthenware vessel, holding about twenty artabae, in which there are many kinds of game elaborately dressed, and many kinds of bread, and of tame birds, and of sea-fish, and also many species of foreign preserved meats and pickled-fish. [550] And very often some people also furnish them with a handsome youth as an attendant. But we ourselves omitted all this, and instead we furnished them with cups of solid silver, each being of as much value as all the things which we have just enumerated put together; and also we presented each man with a horse properly harnessed, and a groom, and gilt trappings; and we invited each man to mount his horse and ride him home."

His son Alexander also became exceedingly fat,  # the one, I mean, who put his mother to death who had been his partner in the kingdom. Accordingly Poseidonius, in the forty-seventh book of his History [ Fr_26 ], mentions him in the following terms:- "But the king of Egypt being detested by the multitude, but flattered by the people whom he had about him, and living in great luxury, was not able even to walk, unless he went leaning on two friends; but for all that he would, at his banquets, leap off from a high couch, and dance barefoot with more vigour than even those who made dancing their profession."

[74.] G    # And Agatharchides, in the sixteenth book of his History of Europe, says that Magas, who was king of Cyrene for fifty years, and who never had any wars, but spent all his time in luxury, became, towards the end of his life, so immensely bulky and burdensome to himself, that he was at last actually choked by his fat, from the inactivity of his body, and the enormous quantity of food which he consumed. But among the Lacedaemonians, the same man relates, in his twenty-seventh book, that it is thought a proof of no ordinary infamy if any one is of an unmanly appearance, or if any one appears at all inclined to have a large belly; as the young men are exhibited naked before the ephors every ten days. And the ephors used every day to take notice both of the clothes and bedding of the young men; and very properly. Moreover, the cooks at Lacedaemon were employed solely on dressing meat plainly, and on nothing else. And in his twenty-seventh book, Agatharchides says that the Lacedaemonians brought Naucleides, the son of Polybiades, who was enormously fat in his body, and who had become of a vast size through luxury, into the middle of the assembly; and then, after Lysander had publicly reproached him as an effeminate voluptuary, they nearly banished him from the city, and threatened him that they would certainly do so if he did not reform his life; on which occasion Lysander said that Agesilaus also, when he was in the country near the Hellespont, making war against the barbarians, seeing the Asians very expensively clothed, but utterly useless in their bodies, ordered all who were taken prisoners, to be stripped naked and sold by the auctioneer; and after that he ordered their clothes to be sold without them; in order that the allies, knowing that they had to fight for a great prize, and against very contemptible men, might advance with greater spirit against their enemies. And Python the orator, of Byzantium, as Leon, his fellow-citizen, relates, was enormously fat; and once, when the Byzantians were divided against one another in seditious quarrels, he urged his fellow-citizens to be reconciled, saying - "You see, my friends, what a size my body is; but I have a wife who is much fatter than I am; now, when we are both agreed, one small bed is large enough for; both of us; but when we quarrel, the whole house is not big enough for us."

[75.] G   [551] How much better, then, is it, my good friend Timocrates, to be poor and thinner than even those men whom Hermippus mentions in his Cercopes, than to be enormously rich, and like that whale of Tanagra, as the before-mentioned men were! But Hermippus uses the following language, addressing Dionysus on the present occasion- 
  For poor men now to sacrifice to you 
  But maimed and crippled oxen; thinner far 
  Than even Thumantis or Leotrophides.

And Aristophanes, in his Gerytades, gives a list of the following people as very thin, who, he says, were sent as ambassadors by the poets on earth down to Hades to the poets there, and his words are- 
  (A)   And who is this who dares to pierce the gates 
  Of lurid darkness, and the realms of the dead! 
  (B)   We're by unanimous agreement chosen, 
  (Making the choice in solemn convocation,) 
  One man from each department of our art, 
  Who were well known travellers to Hades, 
  As often voluntarily going thither. 
  (A)   Are there among you any men who thus 
  Frequent the realms of Hades? 
  (B)   Aye, by Zeus, 
  And plenty; just as there are men who go 
  To Thrace and then come back again. You know 
  The whole case now. 
  (A)   And what may be their names ? 
  First, there's Sannyrion, the comic poet; 
  Then, of the tragic choruses, Melitus; 
  And of the cyclic choruses, Cinesias.

And presently afterwards he says- 
  On what slight hopes did you then all rely! 
  For if a flow of diarrhoea came 
  Upon these men, they'd all be carried off.

And Strattis also mentions Sannyrion, in his Men fond of Cold, saying- 
  The leathern aid of wise Sannyrion.

And Sannyrion himself speaks of Melitus, in his play called Laughter, speaking as follows- 
  Melitus, that carcase from Lenaeum rising.

[76.] G   And Cinesias was in reality an exceedingly tall and exceedingly thin man; on whom Strattis wrote an entire play, calling him the Phthian Achilles, because in his own poetry he was constantly using the word ??????. And accordingly, he, playing on his appearance, continually addresses him- ?????' ???????.

But others, as, for instance, Aristophanes [ Birds_1377 ], often call him ????????? ????????, because he took a plank of linden wood (??????), and fastened it to his waist under his girdle, in order to avoid stooping, because of his great height and extreme thinness. But that Cinesias was a man of delicate health, and badly off in other respects, we are told by Lysias the orator, in his oration inscribed For Phanias accused of illegal Practices, in which he says that [Cinesias], having abandoned his regular profession, had taken to trumping up false accusations against people, and to making money by such means. And that he means the poet here, and no one else, is plain from the fact that he shows also that he had been attacked by the comic poets for impiety. And he also, in the oration itself, shows that [Cinesias] was a person of that character. And the words of the orator are as follows:- "But I marvel that you are not indignant at such a man as Cinesias coming forward in aid of the laws, whom you all know to be the most impious of all men, and the greatest violator of the laws that has ever existed. Is not he the man who has committed such offences against the gods as all other men think it shameful even to speak of, though you hear the comic poets mention such actions of his every year? Did not Apollophanes, and Mystalides, and Lysitheus feast with him, selecting one of the days on which it was not lawful to hold a feast, giving themselves the name of Cacodaemonistae [Evil-Spiriters], instead of Numeniastae [New-Mooners], a name indeed appropriate enough to their fortunes? Nor, indeed, did it occur to them that they were really doing what that name denotes; but they acted in this manner to show their contempt for the gods and for our laws. [552] And accordingly, each of those men perished, as it was reasonable to expect that such men should. But this man, with whom you are all acquainted, the gods have treated in such a manner, that his very enemies would rather that he should live than die, as an example to all other men, that they may see that the immortal Gods do not postpone the punishment due to men who behave insolently towards their Deity, so as to reserve it for their children; but that they destroy the men themselves in a miserable manner, inflicting on them greater and more terrible calamities and diseases than on any other men whatever. For to die, or to be afflicted with sickness in an ordinary manner, is the common lot of all of us; but to be in such a condition as they are reduced to, and to remain a long time in such a state, and to be dying every day, and yet not be able to end one's life, is a punishment allotted to men who act as this man has acted, in defiance of all human and divine law." And this orator used this language respecting Cinesias.

[77.] G    # Philetas also, the Coan poet, was a very thin man; so that, by reason of the leanness of his body, he used to wear balls made of lead fastened to his feet, to prevent himself from being blown over by the wind. And Polemon, surnamed Periegetes, in his treatise on Wonderful People and Things, says that Archestratus the soothsayer, being taken prisoner by the enemy, and being put into the scale, was found to weigh only one obol, so very thin was he. The same man also relates that Panaretus never had occasion to consult a doctor, but that he used to be a pupil of Arcesilaus the philosopher; and that he was a companion of Ptolemy Euergetes, receiving from him a salary of twelve talents every year. And he was the thinnest of men, though he never had any illness all his life.

But Metrodorus of Scepsis, in the second book of his treatise on the Art of Training, says that Hipponax the poet was not only very diminutive in person, but also very thin; and that he, nevertheless, was so strong in his sinews, that, among other feats of strength, he could throw an empty flask (lecythus) an extraordinary distance, although light bodies are not easy to be propelled violently, because they cannot cut the air so well. Philippides, also, was extremely thin, against whom there is an oration extant of Hypereides the orator, who says that he was one of those men who governed the state. And he was very insignificant in appearance by reason of his thinness, as Hypereides has related. And Alexis, in his Thesprotians, said- 
  O Hermes, sent by the gods above, 
  You who've obtained Philippides by lot; 
  And you, too, eye of darkly-robed night.

And Aristophon, in his play called Plato, says- 
  (A)   I will within these three days make this man 
  Thinner than even Philippides. 
  (B)   How so! 
  Can you kill men in such a very short time!

And Menander, in his Passion, says- 
  If hunger should attack your well-shaped person, 
  It would make you thinner than Philippides.

And the word ??????????????? was used for being extremely thin, as we find in Alexis; who, in his Women taking Belladonna, says- 
  (A)   You must be ill. You are, by Zeus, the very 
  Leanest of sparrows- a complete Philippides (??????????????). 
  (B)   Don't tell me such strange things: I'm all but dead. 
  (A)   I pity your sad case.

At all events, it is much better to look like that, than to be like the man of whom Antiphanes in his Aeolus says 
  This man then, because he is such a drunkard, 
  And so enormous is his size of body, 
  Is called by all his countrymen the Bladder.

And Heracleides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasure, says that Deinias the perfumer gave himself up to love because of his luxury, and spent a vast sum of money on it; and when, at last, he failed in his desires, out of grief he mutilated himself, [553] his unbridled luxury bringing him into this trouble.

[78.] G   But it was the fashion at Athens to anoint even the feet of those men who were very luxurious with ointment, a custom which Cephisodorus alludes to in his Trophonius- 
  Then to anoint my body go and buy 
  Essence of lilies, and of roses too, 
  I beg you, Xanthias; and also buy 
  For my poor feet some baccaris.

And Eubulus, in his Sphinx-Carion, says- 
  . . . Lying full softly in a bed-chamber; 
  Around him were most delicate cloaks, well suited 
  For tender maidens, soft, voluptuous; 
  Such as those are, who well perfumed and fragrant 
  With oils of amaracus, do rub my feet.

But the author of the Procris gives an account of what care ought to be taken of Procris' dog, speaking of a dog as if he were a man- 
  (A)   Strew, then, soft carpets underneath the dog, 
  And place beneath cloths of Milesian wool; 
  And put above them all a purple rug. 
  (B)   Phoebus Apollo ! 
  (A)   Then in goose's milk 
  Soak him some groats. 
  (B)   O mighty Heracles ! 
  (A)   And with Megallian oils anoint his feet.

And Antiphanes, in his Alcestis, represents some one as anointing his feet with oil; but in his Mendicant Priest of Cybele, he says- 
  He bade the girl take some choice perfumes 
  From the altar of the goddess, and then, first, 
  Anoint his feet with it, and then his knees: 
  But the first moment that the girl did touch 
  His feet, he leaped up.

And in his Zacynthus he says- 
  Have I not, then, a right to be fond of women, 
  And to regard them all with tender love, 
  For is it not a sweet and noble thing 
  To be treated just as you are; and to have 
  One's feet anointed by fair delicate hands?

And in his Thoricians he says- 
  He bathes completely- but what does he do? 
  He bathes his hands and feet, and well anoints them 
  With perfume from a gold and ample ewer. 
  And with a purple dye he smears his jaws 
  And bosom; and his arms with oil of thyme; 
  His eyebrows and his hair with marjoram; 
  His knees and neck with essence of wild ivy.

And Anaxandrides, in his Protesilaus, says- 
  Ointment from Peron, which this fellow sold 
  But yesterday to Melanopus here, 
  A costly bargain fresh from Egypt, which 
  Anoints today Callistratus' feet.

And Telecleides, in his Prytanes, alludes to the lives of the citizens, even in the time of Themistocles, as having been very much devoted to luxury. And Cratinus in his Cheirons, speaking of the luxury of the former generations, says- 
  There was a scent of delicate thyme besides, 
  And roses too, and lilies by my ear; 
  And in my hands I held an apple, and 
  A staff, and thus I did harangue the people.

[79.] G   And Clearchus of Soli, in his treatise on Love Matters, says- "Why is it that we carry in our hands flowers, and apples, and things of that sort? Is it that by our delight in these things nature points out those of us who have a desire for all kinds of beauty? Is it, therefore, as a kind of specimen of beauty that men carry beautiful things in their hands, and take delight in them? Or do they carry them about for two reasons? For by these means the beginning of good fortune, and a sign of one's wishes, is to a certain extent secured; to those who are asked for them, by their being addressed, and to those who give them, because they give an indication beforehand, that they must give of their beauty in exchange. [554] For a request for beautiful flowers and fruits, suggests that those who receive them are prepared to give in return the beauty of their persons. Perhaps also people are fond of those things, and carry them about them in order to comfort and mitigate the vexation which arises from the neglect or absence of those whom they love. For by the presence of these agreeable objects, the desire for those persons whom we love is blunted; unless, indeed, we may rather say that it is for the sake of personal ornament that people carry those things, and take delight in them, just as they wear anything else which tends to ornament. For not only those people who are crowned with flowers, but those also who carry them in their hands, find their whole appearance is improved by them. Perhaps also, people carry them simply because of their love for any beautiful object. For the love of beautiful objects shows that we are inclined to be fond of the products of the seasons. For the face of spring and autumn is really beautiful, when looked at in their flowers and fruits. And all persons who are in love, being made, as it were, luxurious by their passion, and inclined to admire beauty, are softened by the sight of beauty of any sort. For it is something natural that people who fancy that they themselves are beautiful and elegant, should be fond of flowers; on which account the companions of Persephone are represented as gathering flowers. And Sappho says- 'I saw a lovely maiden gathering flowers.' "

"Aphodrite Callipygos" (Naples)	[80.] G   But in former times men were so devoted to luxury, that they dedicated a temple to Aphrodite Callipygos ["of the Beautiful Buttocks"] on this account. A certain countryman had two beautiful daughters; and they once, contending with one another, went into the public roads, disputing as they went, which had the most beautiful buttocks. And as a young man was passing, who had an aged father, they showed themselves to him also. And he, when he had seen both, decided in favour of the elder; and falling in love with her, he returned into the city and fell ill, and took to his bed, and related what had happened to his brother, who was younger than he; and he also, going into the fields and seeing the girls himself, fell in love with the other. Accordingly, their father, when with all his exhortations he could not persuade his sons to think of a more respectable marriage, brought these girls to them out of the fields, having persuaded their father to give them to him, and married them to his sons. And they were always called the ??????????; as Cercidas of Megalopolis says in his Iambics, in the following line- 
  There was a pair of ?????????? women 
  At Syracuse. 
So they, having now become rich women, built a temple to Aphrodite, calling the goddess Callipygos, as Archelaus also relates in his Iambics.
And that madness can cause great luxury is very pleasantly argued by Heracleides of Pontus, in his treatise on Pleasure, where he says- "Thrasylaus of Aexone, the son of Pythodorus, was once afflicted with such violent madness, that he thought that all the ships which came to the Peiraeus belonged to him. And he entered them in his books as such; and sent them away, and regulated their affairs in his mind, and when they returned to port he received them with great joy, as a man might be expected to who was master of so much wealth. And when any were lost, he never inquired about them, but he rejoiced in all that arrived safe; and so he lived with great pleasure. But when his brother Criton returned from Sicily, and took him and put him into the hands of a doctor, who cured him of his madness, he himself often related his madness, and said that he had never been happier in his life; for that he never felt any grief, but that the quantity of pleasure which he experienced was something unspeakable."

[1.] G   [555] Antiphanes the comic writer, my friend Timocrates, when he was reading one of his own comedies to Alexander the king, and when it was plain that the king did not think much of it, said to him, "The fact is, O king, that a man who is to appreciate this play, ought to have often supped at contribution-dinners, and must have often borne and inflicted blows in the cause of courtesans," as Lycophron of Chalcis relates in his treatise on Comedy. And accordingly we, who are now about to set out a discussion on amatory matters, (for there was a good deal of conversation about married women and about courtesans,) saying what we have to say to people who understand the subject, will invoke the Muse Erato to impress anew on our memory that long amatory catalogue, and make our commencement from this point [ Apollonius Rhodius, 3.1 ]:- 
  Come now, O Erato, and tell me truly 
what it was that was said by the different guests about love and about amatory matters.

[2.] G   For our admirable host, praising the married women, said that Hermippus stated in his book about lawgivers, that at Lacedaemon all the damsels used to be shut up in a dark room, while a number of unmarried young men were shut up with them; and whichever girl each of the young men caught hold of he led away as his wife, without a dowry. On which account they punished Lysander, because he left his former wife, and wished to marry another who was by far more beautiful. But Clearchus of Soli, in his treatise On Proverbs, says,- "In Lacedaemon the women, on a certain festival, drag the unmarried men to an altar, and then thrash them; in order that, for the purpose of avoiding the insult of such treatment, they may become more affectionate, and in due season may turn their thoughts to marriage. But at Athens, Cecrops was the first person who married a man to one wife only, when before his time relationships had taken place at random, and men had had their wives in common. On which account it was, as some people state, that Cecrops was called ?????? ['of double nature'], because before his time people did not know who their fathers were, by reason of the numbers of men who might have been so." And beginning in this manner, one might fairly blame those who attributed to Socrates two wives, Xanthippe and Myrto, the daughter of Aristeides; not of that Aristeides who was surnamed the Just, (for the time does not agree,) but of his descendant in the third generation. [556] And the men who made this statement are Callisthenes, and Demetrius Phalereus, and Satyrus the Peripatetic, and Aristoxenus; who were preceded in it by Aristotle, who relates the same story in his treatise On Nobleness of Birth. Unless perhaps this licence was allowed by a decree at that time on account of the scarcity of men, so that any one who pleased might have two wives; to which it must be owing that the comic poets make no mention of this fact, though they very often mention Socrates. And Hieronymus of Rhodes has cited the decree about wives; which I will send to you, since I have the book. But Panaetius of Rhodes has contradicted those who make this statement about the wives of Socrates.

[3.] G   But among the Persians the queen tolerates the king's having a number of concubines, because there the king rules his wife like her master; and also because the queen, as Dinon states in his history of Persia, receives a great deal of respect from the concubines. At all events they offer her obeisance. And Priamus, too, had a great many women, and Hecabe was not indignant. Accordingly, Priamus says [ Homer, Il_24'496 ]- 
  Nineteen of my sons are from one womb; 
  The rest were born to women in my halls.

But among the Greeks, the mother of Phoenix does not tolerate the concubine of Amyntor [ Homer, Il_9'447 ]. And Medeia, although well acquainted with the fashion, as one well established among the barbarians, refuses to tolerate the marriage of Glauce, because she has been introduced to better habits amongst the Greeks. And Clytaemnestra, being exceedingly indignant at a similar provocation, slays Cassandra with Agamemnon himself, when the monarch brought her back with him into Greece, having yielded to the fashion of barbarian marriages.

"And a man may wonder," says Aristotle, "that Homer has nowhere in the Iliad represented any concubine as living with Menelaus, though he has given wives to every one else. And accordingly, in Homer, even old men sleep with women, such as Nestor and Phoenix. For these men were not worn out or disabled in the time of their youth, either by intoxication, or by too much indulgence in love; or by any weakness of digestion engendered by gluttony; so that it was natural for them to be still vigorous in old age. The king of Sparta, then, appears to have too much respect for his wedded wife Helene, on whose account he gathered all the Greek army; and on this account he keeps aloof from any other relationship. But Agamemnon is reproached by Thersites, as a man with many wives [ Il_2'226 ]- 
  Yours is whatever the warrior's breast inflames, 
  The golden spoil, and yours the lovely dames; 
  With all the wealth the Achaeans can bestow, 
  Your tents are crowded, your chests do overflow. 
"But it is not natural," says Aristotle, "to suppose that all that multitude of female slaves were given to him as concubines, but only as prizes; since he also provided himself with a great quantity of wine, but not for the purpose of getting drunk himself [ Il_7'467 ]."

[4.] G   But Heracles is the man who appears to have had more wives than any one else, for he was very much addicted to women; and he had them in turn, like a soldier, and a man employed at different times in different countries. And by them he had also a great multitude of children. For, in one week, as Herodorus relates, he relieved the fifty daughters of Thestius of their virginity. Aegeus also was a man of many wives. For, first of all he married the daughter of Hoples, and after her he married one of the daughters of Chalcodon, and giving both of them to his friends, he cohabited with a great many without marriage. Afterwards he took Aethra, the daughter of Pittheus; after her he took Medeia. [557] And Theseus, having attempted to ravish Helene, after that carried off Ariadne. Accordingly Ister, in the fourteenth book of his History of the Affairs of Athens, giving a catalogue of those women who became the wives of Theseus, says that some of them became so out of love, and that some were carried off by force, and some were married in legal marriage. Now by force were ravished Helene, Ariadne, Hippolyte, and the daughters of Cercyon and Sinis; and he legally married Meliboea, the mother of Ajax. And Hesiodus says that he also married Hippe and Aegle; on account of whom he broke the oaths which he had sworn to Ariadne, as Cercops tells us. And Pherecydes adds Phereboea. And before ravishing Helene, he had also carried off Anaxo from Troezen; and after Hippolyte he also had Phaedra.

[5.] G   And Philippus the Macedonian did not take any women with him to his wars, as Dareius did, whose power was subverted by Alexander. For he used to take about with him three hundred and fifty concubines in all his wars; as Dicaearchus relates in the third book of his Life in Greece. "But Philippus," says he, "was always marrying new wives in war time. For, in the twenty-two years which he reigned, as Satyrus relates in his History of his Life, having married Audata the Illyrian, he had by her a daughter named Cynna; and he also married Phila, a sister of Derdas and Machatas. And wishing to conciliate the nation of the Thessalians, he had children by two Thessalian women; one of whom was Nicesipolis of Pherae, who brought him a daughter named Thessalonice; and the other was Philinna of Larissa, by whom he had Arrhidaeus. He also acquired the kingdom of the Molossians, when he married Olympias, by whom he had Alexander and Cleopatra. And when he subdued Thrace, there came to him Cothelas, the king of the Thracians, bringing with him Meda his daughter, and many presents: and having married her, he added her to Olympias. And after all these, being violently in love, he married Cleopatra, the sister of Hippostratus and niece of Attalus. And bringing her also home to Olympias, he made all his life unquiet and troubled. For, as soon as this marriage took place, Attalus said, 'Now, indeed, legitimate kings shall be born, and not bastards.' And Alexander having heard this, smote Attalus with a goblet which he had in his hand; and Attalus in return struck him with his cup. And after that Olympias fled to the Molossians; and Alexander fled to the Illyrians. And Cleopatra bore to Philippus a daughter who was named Europa."

Euripides the poet, also, was much addicted to women: at all events Hieronymus in his Historical Commentaries speaks as follows,- "When some one told Sophocles that Euripides was a woman-hater, 'He may be,' said he, 'in his tragedies, but in his bed he is very fond of women.' "

[6.] G   But our married women are not such as Eubulus speaks of in his Female Garland-sellers - 
  By Zeus, we are not painted with vermilion, 
  Nor with dark mulberry juice, as you are often: 
  And then, if in the summer you go out, 
  Two rivulets of dark discoloured hue 
  Flow from your eves, and sweat drops from your jaws, 
  And makes a scarlet furrow down your neck; 
  And the light hair, which wantons o'er your face, 
  [558] Seems grey, so thickly is it plastered over.

And Anaxilas, in his Neottis, says- 
  The man whoever has loved a courtesan, 
  Will say that no more lawless worthless race 
  Can anywhere be found: for what ferocious 
  Unsociable she-dragon, what Chimaera, 
  Though it breathe fire from its mouth, what Charybdis, 
  What three-headed Scylla, dog of the sea, 
  Or hydra, sphinx, or raging lioness, 
  Or viper, or winged harpy (greedy race), 
  Could go beyond those most accursed harlots? 
  There is no monster greater. They alone 
  Surpass all other evils put together. 
  And let us now consider them in order:- 
  First there is Plang?n; she, like a Chimaera, 
  Scorches the wretched barbarians with fire; 
  One knight alone was found to rid the world of her, 
  Who, like a brave man, stole her furniture 
  And fled, and she despairing, disappeared. 
  Then for Sinope's friends, may I not say 
  That it is a hydra they cohabit with? 
  For she is old: but near her age, and like her, 
  Greedy Gnathaena flaunts, a twofold evil. 
  And as for Nanni?n, in what, I pray, 
  Does she from Scylla differ? Has she not 
  Already swallowed up two lovers, and 
  Opened her greedy jaws to enfold a third? 
  But he with prosperous oar escaped the gulf. 
  Then does not Phryne beat Charybdis hollow? 
  Who swallows the sea-captains, ship and all. 
  Is not Theano a mere de-feathered Siren? 
  Their face and voice are woman's, but their legs 
  Are feathered like a blackbird's. Take the lot, 
  'Tis not too much to call them Theban Sphinxes. 
  For they speak nothing plain, but only riddles; 
  And in enigmas tell their victims how 
  They love and dote, and long to be caressed. 
  "Would that I had a quadruped," says one, 
  That may serve for a bed or easy chair. 
  "Would that I had a tripod" - "Or a biped," 
  That is, a handmaid. And the hapless fool 
  Who understands these hints, like Oedipus, 
  If saved at all is saved against his will. 
  But they who do believe they're really loved 
  Are much elated, and raise their heads to heaven. 
  And in a word, of all the beasts on earth 
  The direst and most treacherous is a harlot.

[7.] G   After Larensis had said all this, Leonides, finding fault with the very name ?????? ("married woman"), quoted these verses out of the Soothsayers of Alexis- 
  Oh wretched are we husbands, who have sold 
  All liberty of life, all luxury, 
  And live as slaves of women, not as freemen. 
  We say we have a dowry; do we not 
  Endure the penalty, full of female bile, 
  Compared to which the bile of man's pure honey? 
  For men, though injured, pardon: but the women 
  First injure us, and then reproach us more; 
  They rule those whom they should not; those they should 
  They constantly neglect. They falsely swear; 
  They have no single hardship, no disease; 
  And yet they are complaining without end.

[559] And Xenarchus, in his Sleep, says- 
  Are then the grasshoppers not happy, say you ? 
  When they have wives who cannot speak a word.

And Philetaerus, in his Corinthiast, says- 
  O Zeus, how melting and soft an eye 
  The lady has! 'Tis not for nothing we 
  Behold the temple of Hetaera here; 
  But there is not one temple to a wife 
  Throughout the whole of Greece.

And Amphis says in his Athamas- 
  Is not a courtesan much more good-humoured 
  Than any wedded wife ? No doubt she is, 
  And it is only natural; for she, by law, 
  Thinks she's a right to sulk and stay at home: 
  But well the other knows that it is her manners 
  By which alone she can retain her friends; 
  And if they fail, she must seek out some others.

[8.] G   And Eubulus, in his Chrysilla, says- 
  May that man, fool as he is, who marries 
  A second wife, most miserably perish; 
  Him who weds one, I will not blame too much, 
  For he knew little of the ills he courted. 
  But well the widower had proved all 
  The ills which are in wedlock and in wives.

And a little further on he says- 
  O holy Zeus, may I be quite undone, 
  If ever I say a word against the women, 
  The choicest of all creatures. And suppose 
  Medeia was a termagant,- what then ? 
  Was not Penelope a noble creature ? 
  If one should say, "Just think of Clytaemnestra," 
  I meet him with Alcestis chaste and true. 
  Perhaps he'll turn and say no good of Phaedra; 
  But think of virtuous . . .. who ? . . . . Alas, alas! 
  I cannot recollect another good one, 
  Though I could still count bad ones up by scores.

And Aristophon, in his Callonides, says- 
  May he be quite undone, he well deserves it, 
  Who dares to marry any second wife; 
  A man who marries once may be excused; 
  Not knowing what misfortune he was seeking. 
  But he who, once escaped, then tries another, 
  With his eyes open seeks for misery.

And Antiphanes, in his Philopator, says- 
  (A)   He's married now. 
  (B)   How say you? do you mean 
  He's really gone and married- when I left him, 
  Alive and well, possessed of all his senses ?

And Menander, in his Symbol-Bearer, or The Female Flute-player, says- 
  (A)   You will not marry if you're in your senses, 
  Abandoning your current life. For I myself 
  Did marry; so I recommend you not to. 
  (B)   The matter is decided- the die is cast. 
  (A)   Go on then. I do wish you then well over it; 
  But you are taking arms, with no good reason, 
  Against a sea of troubles. In the waves 
  Of the deep Libyan or Aegean sea 
  Scarce three of thirty ships are lost or wrecked; 
  But scarcely one poor husband escapes at all.

And in his Woman Burnt he says- 
  Oh, may the man be totally undone 
  Who was the first to venture on a wife; 
  And then the next who followed his example; 
  And then the third, and fourth, and all who followed.

And Carcinus the tragedian, in his Semele (which begins, "O nights"), says-
  O Zeus, why need one waste one's words 
  In speaking ill of women? for what worse 
  Can he add, once he has called them women.

[9.] G   But, above all other cases, those who when advanced in years marry young wives, do not perceive that they are running voluntarily into danger, which every one else foresees plainly; and that, too, though the Megarian poet [ Theognis_457 ] has given them this warning: 
  [560] A young wife suits not with an aged husband; 
  For she will not obey the pilot's helm 
  Like a well-managed boat; nor can the anchor 
  Hold her securely in her port, but oft 
  She breaks her chains and cables in the night, 
  And headlong drives into another harbour.

And Theophilus, in his Neoptolemus, says- 
  A young wife does not suit an old man well; 
  For, like a crazy boat, she not at all 
  Answers the helm, but slips her cable off 
  By night, and in some other port is found.

[10.] G   And I do not think that any of you are ignorant, my friends, that the greatest wars have taken place on account of women:- the Trojan war on account of Helene; the plague which took place in it was on account of Chryseis; the anger of Achilles was excited about Briseis; and the war called the Sacred War, on account of another wife (as Duris relates in the second book of his History), who was a Theban by birth, by name Theano, and who was carried off by some Phocian. And this war also lasted ten years, and in the tenth year was brought to an end by the cooperation of Philippus; for by his aid the Thebans took Phocis.

The war, also, which is called the Crissaean War (as Callisthenes tells us in his account of the Sacred War), when the Crissaeans made war upon the Phocians, lasted ten years; and it was excited on this account,- because the Crissaeans carried off Megisto, the daughter of Pelagon the Phocian, and the daughters of the Argives, as they were returning from the Pythian temple: and in the tenth year Crissa was taken. And whole families also have been ruined owing to women;- for instance, that of Philippus, the father of Alexander, was ruined on account of his marriage with Cleopatra; and Heracles was ruined by his marriage with Iole, the daughter of Eurytus; and Theseus on account of his marriage with Phaedra, the daughter of Minos; and Athamas on account of his marriage with Themisto, the daughter of Hypseus; and Jason on account of his marriage with Glauce, the daughter of Creon; and Agamemnon on account of Cassandra. And, the expedition of Cambyses against Egypt (as Ctesias relates) took place on account of a woman; for Cambyses, having heard that Egyptian women were far more amorous than other women, sent to Amasis the king of the Egyptians, asking him for one of his daughters in marriage. But Amasis did not give him one of his own daughters, thinking that she would not be honoured as a wife, but only treated as a concubine; but he sent him Nitetis, the daughter of Apries. And Apries had been deposed from the sovereignty of Egypt, because of the defeats which had been inflicted on him by the Cyrenaeans; and afterwards he had been put to death by Amasis. Accordingly, Cambyses, being much pleased with Nitetis, and being very violently in love with her, learnt the whole circumstances of the case from her; and she entreated him to avenge the murder of Apries, and persuaded him to make war upon the Egyptians. But Dinon, in his History of Persia, and Lynceas of Naucratis, in the third book of his History of Egypt, say that it was Cyrus to whom Nitetis was sent by Amasis; and that she was the mother of Cambyses, who made this expedition against Egypt to avenge the wrongs of his mother and her family.  # But Duris the Samian says that the first war carried on by two women was that between Olympias and Eurydice; in which Olympias advanced something in the manner of a Bacchant, with drums beating; but Eurydice came forward armed like a Macedonian soldier, having been already accustomed to war and military habits at the court of Cynnane the Illyrian.

[11.] G   [561] Now, after this conversation, it seemed good to the philosophers who were present to say something themselves about love and about beauty: and so a great many philosophical sentiments were uttered; among which, some quoted the songs of the dramatic philosopher, Euripides, some of which were these:- 
  Eros, who is wisdom's pupil gay, 
  To virtue often leads the way: 
  And this great god 
  Is of all others far the best for man; 
  For with his gentle nod 
  He bids them hope, and banishes all pain. 
  Never may I be amongst those who scorn 
  To own his power, and live forlorn, 
  Cherishing habits all uncouth. 
  I entreat every youth 
  Never to flee from Love, 
  But welcome him, and willing subjects prove.

And some one else quoted from Pindarus:- 
  Let it be my fate always to love, 
  And to obey love's will in proper season.

And some one else added the following lines from Euripides:- 
  But you, O mighty Eros, of gods and men 
  The sovereign ruler, either bid what's fair 
  To seem no longer fair; or else bring aid 
  To hapless lovers whom you've caused to love, 
  And aid the labours you yourself have prompted. 
  If you do this, the gods will honour you; 
  But if you keep aloof, you will not even 
  Retain the gratitude which now they feel 
  For having learnt of you the way to love.

[12.] G   And Pontianus said that Zenon of Citium thought that Eros was the God of Friendship and Liberty, and also that he was the great author of concord among men; but that he had no other office. On which account, he says in his Republic, that Eros is a God, being one who cooperates in securing the safety of the city. And the philosophers, who were earlier than him, also considered Eros a venerable Deity, removed from everything discreditable: and this is plain from their having set up holy statues in his honour in their gymnasia, along with those of Hermes and Heracles - the one of whom is the patron of eloquence, and the other of valour. And when these are united, friendship and unanimity are engendered; by means of which the most perfect liberty is secured to those who excel in these practices. But the Athenians were so far from thinking that Eros presided over the mere gratification of sexual intercourse, that, though the Academy was manifestly consecrated to Athene, they yet erected in that place also a statue of Eros, and sacrificed to it. The Thespians also celebrate Erotidia, or festivals of Eros, just as the Athenians do Athenaea, or festivals of Athene, and as the Eleans celebrate the Olympian festivals, and the Rhodians the Halieia. And in the public sacrifices, everywhere almost, Eros is honoured. And the Lacedaemonians offer sacrifices to Eros before they go to battle, thinking that safety and victory depend on the friendship of those who stand side by side in the battle array. And the Cretans, in their line of battle, adorn the handsomest of their citizens, and employ them to offer sacrifices to Eros on behalf of the state, as Sosicrates relates. And the regiment among the Thebans which is called the Sacred Band, is wholly composed of mutual lovers, indicating the majesty of Eros, as these men prefer a glorious death to a shameful and discreditable life. But the Samians (as Erxias says, in his History of Colophon), having consecrated a gymnasium to Eros, [562] called the festival which was instituted in his honour the Eleutheria ["Feast of Liberty"]; and it was owing to this God, too, that the Athenians obtained their freedom. And the Peisistratidae, after their banishment, were the first people who ever tried to throw discredit on the events which took place through his influence.

[13.] G   After this had been said, Plutarchus cited the following passage from the Phaedrus of Alexis: 
  As I was coming back from Peiraeus, 
  In great perplexity and sad distress, 
  I fell to thoughts of deep philosophy. 
  And first I thought that all the painters seem 
  Ignorant of the real nature of Eros; 
  And so do all the other artists too, 
  Who make statues of this deity: 
  For he is neither male nor female either; 
  Again, he is not god, nor yet is he man: 
  He is not foolish, nor yet is he wise; 
  But he's made up of all kinds of quality, 
  And underneath one form bears many natures. 
  His courage is a man's; his cowardice 
  A very woman's. Then his folly is 
  Pure madness, but his wisdom a philosopher's; 
  His vehemence is that of a wild beast, 
  But his endurance is like adamant; 
  His jealousy equals any other god's. 
  And I, indeed,- by Athene and all the gods,- 
  Do not myself precisely understand him; 
  But still he much resembles my description, 
  And I have come close to the truth.

And Eubulus, or Araros, in his Campylion, says:- 
  What man was he, what modeller or painter, 
  Who first did represent young Eros as winged? 
  He was a man fit only to draw swallows, 
  Quite ignorant of the character of the god. 
  For he's not light, nor easy for a man 
  Who's once by him been mastered, to shake off; 
  But he's a heavy and tenacious master. 
  How, then, can he be spoken of as winged: 
  The man's a fool who such a thing could say.

And Alexis, in his Cut off, says:- 
  For this opinion is by all the sophists 
  Embraced, that Eros is not a winged god; 
  But that the winged parties are the lovers, 
  And that he falsely bears this imputation: 
  So that it is out of pure ignorance 
  That painters clothe this deity with wings.

[14.] G   And Theophrastus, in his book on Eros, says that Chaeremon the tragedian said in one of his plays, that:- 
  As wine adapts itself to the constitution 
  Of those who drink it, so likewise does Eros 
  Who, when he's moderately worshipped, 
  Is mild and manageable; but if loosed 
  From moderation, then is fierce and troublesome.

. . . On which account the same poet [Euripides] afterwards, as he aptly distinguishes the god's powers, says [Euripides, IA_548]:- 
  For he doth bend a double bow of beauty, 
  And sometimes men to fortune leads, 
  But sometimes overwhelms their lives 
  With trouble and confusion.

. . . But the same poet [Alexis] also, in his play entitled The Wounded Man, speaks of people in love in this manner:- 
  Who would not say that those who love 
  Live a life of hard labour? 
  For first of all they must be skilful soldiers, 
  And able to endure great toil of body, 
  And to stick close to the objects of their love: 
  They must be active, and inventive too, 
  Eager, and fertile in expedients, 
  And prompt to see their way in difficulties.

[563] And Theophilus, in his Man fond of the Flute, says:- 
  Who says that lovers are devoid of sense? 
  He is himself no better than a fool: 
  For if you take away from life its pleasures, 
  You leave it nothing but impending death. 
  And I myself am now indeed in love 
  With a fair maiden playing on the harp; 
  And tell me, pray, am I a fool for that? 
  She's fair, she's tall, she's skilful in her art; 
  And I'm more glad when I see her, than you 
  (?) When you share the admission price among you.

But Aristophon, in his Pythagorean, says:- 
  Now, is not Eros deservedly cast out 
  From his place among the twelve immortal gods? 
  For he did sow the seeds of great confusion, 
  And quarrels dire, among that heavenly band, 
  When he was one of them. And, as he was 
  Bold and impertinent, they clipped his wings, 
  That he might never soar again to heaven; 
  And then they banished him to us below; 
  And for the wings which he did boast before, 
  Them they did give to Victory, a spoil 
  Well won, and splendid, from her enemy.

Amphis, too, in his Dithyrambus, speaks thus of loving:- 
  What do you say?- do you think that all your words 
  Could ever persuade me that that man's a lover 
  Who falls in love with a girl's manners only, 
  And never thinks what kind of face she's got? 
  I call him mad; nor can I ever believe 
  That a poor man, who often sees a rich one, 
  Forbears to covet some of his great riches.

But Alexis says in his Helene:- 
  The man who falls in love with beauty's flower, 
  And takes heed of nothing else, may be 
  A lover of pleasure, but not of his love; 
  And he does openly disparage Eros, 
  And causes him to be suspect to others.

[15.] G   Myrtilus, having cited these lines of Alexis, and then looking round on the men who were partisans of the Stoic school, first recited the following passage out of the Iambics of Hermeias of Curium- 
  Listen, you Stoiclings, traffickers in nonsense, 
  Punners on words,- gluttons, who by yourselves 
  Eat up the whole of what is in the dishes, 
  And give no single bit to a philosopher. 
  Besides, you are most clearly proved to do 
  All that is contrary to those declarations 
  Which you so pompously parade abroad, 
  Hunting for beauty;- 
and then went on to say,-  # And in this point alone you are imitators of the master of your school, Zenon the Phoenician, who was always a slave to the most infamous passions (as Antigonus of Carystus relates, in his Life of Zenon); for you are always saying that "the proper object of love is not the body, but the mind;" you who say at the same time, that you ought to remain faithful to the objects of your love, till they are eight-and-twenty years of age.  And Ariston of Ceos, the Peripatetic, appears to me to have said very well (in the second book of his treatise on Likenesses connected with Love), to some Athenian who was very tall for his age, and at the same time was boasting of his beauty, (and his name was Dorus,) "It seems to me that one may very well apply to you the line which Odysseus uttered when he met Dolon [ Homer, Il_10'401 ], 
  Great was thy aim, and mighty is the prize."

[16.] G   [564] But Hegesander, in his Commentaries, says that all men love seasoned dishes, but not plain meats, or plainly dressed fish. And accordingly, when there is no seasoning, no one willingly eats either meat or fish; nor does any one desire meat which is raw and unseasoned. For in ancient times men used to love boys (as Ariston relates); on which account it came to pass that the objects of their love were called boy-favourites [???????]. And it was with truth (as Clearchus says in the first book of his treatise On Love and the Affairs of Love) that Lycophronides said:- 
   No boy, no maid with golden ornaments, 
  No woman with a deep and ample robe, 
  Is so much beautiful as modest; for 
  'Tis modesty that gives the bloom to beauty.

And Aristotle said that lovers look at no other part of the objects of their affection, but only at their eyes, in which modesty makes her abode. And Sophocles somewhere represents Hippodameia as speaking of the beauty of Pelops, and saying- 
  And in his eyes the charm which love compels 
   Shines forth a light, embellishing his face: 
  He glows himself, and he makes me glow too, 
  Measuring my eyes with his,- as any builder 
  Makes his work correspond to his careful rule.

[17.] G   And Licymnius the Chian, saying that Hypnos [sleep] was in love with Endymion, represents him as refusing to close the eyes of the youth even when he is asleep; but the god sends his beloved one to sleep with his eyelids still open, so that he may not for a single moment be deprived of the pleasure of contemplating them. And his words are these:- 
   But Hypnos much delighted 
  In the bright beams which shot from his eyes, 
  And lulled the youth to sleep with unclosed lids.

And Sappho says to a man who was admired above all measure for his beauty, and who was accounted very handsome indeed:- 
  Stand opposite, my love, 
  And open upon me 
  The beauteous grace which from your eyes does flow.

And what says Anacreon? 
  Oh, boy, as maiden fair, I fix my heart on you; 
  But you despise my prayer, 
  And little care that you do hold the reins 
  Which my soul's course incessantly do guide.

And the magnificent Pindarus says:- 
   The man who gazes on the brilliant rays 
  Which shoot from the eyes 
  Of beautiful Theoxenus, and yet can feel his heart 
  Unmoved within his breast, nor yields to love, 
  Must have a heart 
  Black, and composed of adamant or iron.

But the Cyclops of Philoxenus of Cythera, in love with Galateia, and praising her beauty, and prophesying, as it were, his own blindness, praises every part of her rather than mention her eyes, which he does not; speaking thus:- 
  O Galateia, 
  Nymph with the beauteous face and golden hair, 
  Whose voice the Graces tune, 
  True flower of love, my beauteous Galateia.

But this is but a blind panegyric, and not at all to be compared with the poem of Ibycus:- 
  Beauteous Euryalus, of all the Graces 
  The choicest branch,- object of love to all 
  The fair-haired {Muses},- sure the goddess 
  Cypris, and tender-eyed Persuasion, 
  Combined to nourish you on beds of roses.

And Phrynichus said of Troilus:- 
  The light of love shines in his purple cheeks.

[18.] G   But you prefer having all the objects of your love shaved and hairless. And this custom of shaving the beard, originated in the age of Alexander, [565] as Chrysippus tells us in the fourth book of his treatise On the Beautiful and on Pleasure. And I think it will not be inappropriate if I quote what he says; for he is an author of whom I am very fond, on account of his great learning and his gentle good-humoured disposition. And these are the words of the philosopher:- "The custom of shaving the beard was introduced in the time of Alexander, for the people in earlier times did not practise it; and Timotheus the flute-player used to play on the flute having a very long beard. And at Athens they even now remember that the man who first shaved his chin, (and he is not a very ancient man indeed,) was given the surname of ??????; on which account Alexis says:- 
  Do you see any man whose beard has been 
  Removed by sharp pitch-plasters or by razors? 
  In one of these two ways he may be spoken, of: 
  Either he seems to me to think of war, 
  And so to be rehearsing acts of fierce 
  Hostility against his beard and chin; 
  Or else he's some complaint of wealthy men. 
  For how, I pray you, do your beards annoy you? - 
  Beards by which best you may be known as men! 
   Unless, indeed, you're planning now some deed 
  Unworthy of the character of men.

And Diogenes, when he saw some one once whose chin was smooth, said, 'I am afraid you think you have great ground to accuse nature, for having made you a man and not a woman.' And once, when he saw another man, riding a horse, who was shaved in the same manner, and perfumed all over, and clothed, too, in a fashion corresponding to those particulars, he said that he had often asked what a ?????????? was; and now he had found out. And at Rhodes, though there is a law against shaving, still no one ever prosecutes another for doing so, as the whole population is shaved.  And at Byzantium, though there is a penalty to which any barber is liable who is possessed of a razor, still every one uses a razor despite that law." And this is the statement of the admirable Chrysippus.

[19.] G   But that wise Zenon, as Antigonus of Carystus says, speaking, as it should seem, almost prophetically of the lives and professed discipline of your sect, said that "those who misunderstood and failed rightly to enter into the spirit of his words, would become dirty and mean; just as those who adopted Aristippus's sect, but perverted his precepts, became intemperate and shameless." And the greater portion of you are such as that,  men with contracted brows, and dirty clothes, sordid not only in your dispositions, but also in your appearance. For, wishing to assume the character of independence and frugality, you are found at the gate of avarice, living sordidly, clothed in scanty cloaks, filling the soles of your shoes with nails, and giving hard names to any one who uses the very smallest quantity of perfume, or who is dressed in apparel which is at all delicate. But men of your sect have no business to be attracted by money,  or to lead about the objects of their love with their beards shaved and smooth, who follow you, as Antiphanes, says:- 
  In the Lyceium, with sophists, by Zeus! - 
  Thin, starved philosophers, as dry as leather.

[20.] G   But I am a great admirer of beauty myself. For, in the contests [at Athens] for the prize of manliness, they select the handsomest, and give them the post of honour to bear the sacred vessels at the festivals of the gods. And at Elis there is a contest of beauty, and the conqueror has the vessels of the goddess given to him to carry; and the next handsomest has the ox to lead, and the third places the sacrificial cakes on the head of the victim. [566] But Heracleides Lembus relates that in Sparta the handsomest man and the handsomest woman have special honours conferred on them; and Sparta is famous for producing the handsomest women in the world. On which account they tell a story of king Archidamus, that when one wife was offered to him who was very handsome, and another who was ugly but rich, and he chose the rich one, the ephors imposed a fine upon him,  saying that he had preferred begetting kinglings rather than kings for the Spartans. And Euripides has said:- 
  Firstly, a form that is worthy of a kingdom.

And in Homer, the old men among the people marvelling at the beauty of Helene, are represented as speaking thus to one another [ Il_3'156 ]:- 
  They cried, "No wonder the Trojans and Achaeans 
  Have suffered woes so long for this woman;- 
  Her countenance is like to an immortal goddess!"

And even Priamus himself is moved at the beauty of the woman, though he is in great distress.  And also he admires Agamemnon for his beauty, and uses the following language respecting him [ Il_3'169 ]:- 
  Say, what Greek is he 
  Around whose brow such martial graces shine,- 
  So tall, so awful, and almost divine! 
  Though some of larger stature tread the green, 
  None match his grandeur and exalted mien.

And many nations have made the handsomest men their kings on that account. As even to this day that Ethiopian tribe called the Immortals does; as Bion relates in his History of the Affairs of Ethiopia. For, as it would seem, they consider beauty as the especial attribute of kings. And goddesses have contended with one another respecting beauty;  and it was on account of his beauty that the gods carried off Ganymedes to be the cupbearer of Zeus [ Homer, Il_20'235 ]:- 
  The matchless Ganymedes, divinely fair, 
  Whom Heaven, enamoured, snatched to upper air.

And who are they whom the goddesses have carried off? are they not the handsomest of men? And they cohabit with them; as Dawn does with Cephalus and Cleitus and Tithonus; and Demeter with Iasion; and Aphrodite with Anchises and Adonis. And it was for the sake of beauty also that the greatest of the gods entered through a roof under the form of gold, and became a bull, and often transformed himself into a winged eagle, as he did in the case of Aegina. And Socrates the philosopher, who despised everything, was, for all that, subdued by the beauty of Alcibiades;  as also was the venerable Aristotle by the beauty of his pupil [Theodectas] of Phaselis. And do not we too, even in the case of inanimate things, prefer what is the most beautiful? The fashion, too, of Sparta is much praised, I mean that of displaying their maidens naked to their guests; and in the island of Chios it is a beautiful sight to go to the gymnasia and the race-courses, and to see the young men wrestling naked with the maidens, who are also naked.

[21.] G   And Cynulcus said:-

And do you dare to talk in this way, you who are not "rosy-fingered", as Cratinus says, but who have one foot made of cow-dung [ Aristophanes, Frogs_294 ], and carry around the leg of your namesake the poet [Myrtilus]? You spend all your time in wineshops and inns, although Isocrates the orator has said, in his Areopagitic Oration [ 49 ], "But not one of their servants ever would have ventured to eat or drink in a wineshop; for they studied to keep up the dignity of their appearance, and not to behave like buffoons." And Hypereides, in his oration against Patrocles (if, at least, the speech is a genuine one), says that they forbade a man who had dined at a wineshop from going up to the Areopagus. [22.] G   [567] But you, you sophist, spend your time in wineshops, not with your friends (???????), but with prostitutes (???????), having a lot of female pimps about you, and always carrying about these books of Aristophanes, and Apollodorus, and Ammonius, and Antiphanes, and also of Gorgias the Athenian, who have all written about the prostitutes at Athens. Oh, what a learned man you are! how far are you from imitating Theomander of Cyrene,  who, as Theophrastus, in his treatise On Happiness, says, used to go about and profess that he gave lessons in prosperity. You, you teacher of love, are in no respect better than Amasis of Elis, whom Theophrastus, in his treatise On Love, says was extraordinarily addicted to amatory pursuits. And a man will not be much out who calls you a pornographer [???????????], just as they call Aristeides and (?) Pausias and Nicophanes painters [????????]. And Polemon mentions them, as painting these subjects exceedingly well, in his treatise On the Pictures at Sicyon. Think, my friends, of the great and varied learning of this grammarian, who does not conceal what he means, but openly quotes the verses of Eubulus, in his Cercopes:- 
   I came to Corinth; there I ate with pleasure 
  Some herb called basil [ocim?n], and was ruined by it; 
  And also, trifling there, I lost my cloak.

And the Corinthian sophist is very fine here, explaining to his pupils that Ocim?n is the name of a harlot. And a great many other plays also, you impudent fellow, derived their names from courtesans. There is the Thalatta of Diocles, the Corianno of Pherecrates, the Anteia of Eunicus or Philyllius, the Thais, and the Phani?n of Menander, the Opora of Alexis, the Clepsydra of Eubulus - and the woman who bore this name,  had it because she used to distribute her favours by a water-clock, and to dismiss her visitors when it had run down; as Asclepiades, the son of Areius, relates in his History of Demetrius Phalereus; and he says that her proper name was Metiche.

As Antiphanes says in his Farmer:- 
  A courtesan is a positive 
  Calamity and ruin to her keeper; 
  And yet he is glad to nourish such a pest.

On which account, in the Neaera of Timocles, a man is represented as lamenting his fate, and saying:- 
  But I, unhappy man, who first loved Phryne 
  When she was but a gatherer of capers, 
  And was not quite as rich as now she is,- 
  I who spent such sums of money upon her, 
  Am now excluded from her doors.

And in the play entitled Orestautocleides, the same Timocles says:- 
  And round the wretched man old women sleep, 
  Nanni?n and Plang?n, Lyca, Phryne too, 
  Gnathaena, Pythionice, Myrrhine, 
  Chrysis, Conalis, Hierocleia, and 
  Lopadi?n also.

And these courtesans are mentioned by Amphis, in his Curis, where he says:- 
  Wealth truly seems to me to be quite blind, 
  Since he never ventures near this woman's doors, 
  But haunts Sinope, Nanni?n, and Lyca, 
  And others like them, traps of men's existence. 
  And in their houses sits like one amazed, 
  And never departs.

[23.] G   [568] And Alexis, in the drama entitled Isostasium, thus describes the equipment of a courtesan, and the artifices which some women use to make themselves up:- 
  For, first of all, to earn themselves much gain, 
  And better to plunder all the neighbouring men, 
  They use a heap of adventitious aids, - 
  They plot to take in every one. And when, 
  By subtle artifice, they've made some money, 
  They enlist fresh girls, and add recruits, who never 
  Have tried the trade, into their cunning troop. 
  And drill them so that they are very soon 
  Different in manners, and in look, and semblance 
  From all they were before. Suppose one's short - 
  They put cork soles within the heels of her shoes; 
  Is any one too tall - she wears a slipper 
  Of thinnest substance, and, with head bent down 
  Between the shoulders, walks the public streets, 
  And so reduces her superfluous height. 
  Is any one too lean about the flank - 
  They hoop her with a bustle, so that all 
  Who see her marvel at her her proportions. 
  Has any one too prominent a stomach - 
  They crown it with false breasts, such as perchance 
  At times you may in comic actors see; 
  And what is still too prominent, they force 
  Back, ramming it as if with scaffolding. 
  Has any one red eyebrows - those they smear 
  With soot. Has any one a dark complexion - 
  White-lead will that correct. This girl's too fair - 
  They rub her well with rich vermillion. 
  Is she a splendid figure - then her charms 
  Are shown in naked beauty to the purchaser. 
  Has she good teeth - then she is forced to laugh, 
  That all the bystanders may see her mouth, 
  How beautiful it is; and if she be 
  But ill-inclined to laugh, then she is kept 
  Close within doors whole days, and the things 
  Which butchers use when selling goats' heads, 
  Such as a stick of myrrh, she's forced to keep 
  Between her lips, till they have learnt the shape 
  Of the required grin. And by such arts 
  They make their charms and persons up for market.

[24.] G   And therefore I advise you, my Thessalian friend with the handsome chairs, to be content to embrace the women in the brothels, and not to spend the inheritance of your children on vanities. For, truly, the lame man gets on best at this sort of work; since your father, the boot-maker, did not lecture you and teach you any great deal, and did not force you to look like leather. Or do you not know those women, as we find them called in the Pannuchis of Eubulus - 
  Thrifty decoys, who gather in the money,- 
  Well-trained fillies of Aphrodite, standing 
  Naked in line, clad in transparent robes 
  Of thinnest web, like the fair damsels whom 
  Eridanus waters with his holy stream ; 
  From whom, with safety and frugality, 
  You may buy pleasure at a moderate cost.

And in his Nanni?n, (if the play under this name is the work of Eubulus, and not of Philippus):- 
  For he who secretly goes hunting for 
  Illicit love, must surely of all men 
  Most miserable be; and yet he may 
  See in the light of the sun a willing row 
  Of naked damsels, standing all arrayed 
  In robes transparent, like the damsels whom 
  Eridanus waters with his holy stream, 
  And buy some pleasure at a trifling rate, 
  [569] Without pursuing a clandestine love 
  (There is no heavier calamity), 
  Just out of wantonness and not for love. 
  I do bewail the fate of hapless Greece, 
  Which sent forth such an admiral as Cydias.

Xenarchus also, in his Pentathlum, reproaches those men who live as you do, and who fix their hearts on extravagant courtesans, and on freeborn women, in the following lines:- 
  It is a terrible, yes a terrible and 
  Intolerable evil, what the young 
  Men do throughout this city. And yet 
  There are most beauteous damsels in the brothels, 
  Whom any man may see standing all willing 
  In the full light of day, with open bosoms, 
  Showing their naked charms, all in a row, 
  Marshalled in order; and there they may choose 
  Without the slightest trouble, as they fancy, 
  Thin, stout, or round, tall, wrinkled, or smooth-faced, 
  Young, old, or middle-aged, or elderly, 
  So that they need not clamber up a ladder, 
  Nor steal through windows out of free men's houses, 
  Nor smuggle themselves inside bags of chaff. 
  For these gay girls will ravish you by force, 
  And drag you in to them; if old, they'll call you 
  Their dear papa; if young, their darling baby; 
  And these a man may fearlessly and cheaply 
  Amuse himself with, morning, noon, or night, 
  In any way he please. But the other women 
  He dares not gaze on openly nor look at, 
  But fearing, trembling, shivering, with his heart, 
  As they say, in his mouth, he creeps towards them. 
  How can these men, sea-born immortal Aphrodite, 
  Press on, even when they have the opportunity, 
  If any thought of Dracon's laws comes over them.

[25.] G   And Philemon, in his Brothers, relates that Solon at first, on account of the unbridled passions of the young, made a law that women might be brought to be prostituted at brothels; as Nicander of Colophon also states, in the third book of his History of the Affairs of Colophon, saying that he first erected a temple to the Public Aphrodite with the money which was earned by the women who were prostituted at these brothels.

But Philemon speaks on this subject as follows: 
  But you did well for every man, O Solon; 
  For they do say you were the first to see 
  The justice of a public-spirited measure, 
  The saviour of the state- (and it is fit 
  For me to utter this avowal, Solon);- 
  You, seeing that the state was full of men, 
  Young, and possessed of all the natural appetites, 
  And wandering in their lusts where they'd no business, 
  Bought women, and in certain spots did place them, 
  Common to be, and ready for all comers. 
  They naked stand: look well at them, my youth,- 
  Do not deceive yourself; are you not well off? 
  You're ready, so are they: the door is open- 
  The price an obol: enter straight- there is 
  No nonsense here, no cheat or trickery; 
  But do just what you like, and how you like. 
  You're off: wish her good-bye; she's no more claim on you.

And Aspasia, the friend of Socrates, imported great numbers of beautiful women, and Greece was entirely filled with her courtesans; as that witty writer Aristophanes relates [ Acharn_524 ], saying that the Peloponnesian war was excited by Pericles, [570] on account of his love for Aspasia, and on account of the girls who had been carried away from her by the Megarians. 
  For some young men, drunk with the cottabus, 
  Going to Megara, carry off by stealth 
  A harlot named Simaetha. Then the citizens 
  Of Megara, full of grief and indignation, 
  Stole in return two of Aspasia's girls; 
  And this was the beginning of the war 
  Which devastated Greece, for three lewd women.

[26.] G   I therefore, my most learned grammarian, warn you to beware of the courtesans who want a high price, because 
  You may see other girls who play the flute, 
  Playing the tunes of Apollo, or of Zeus; 
  But these play no tune save the tune of the hawk, 
as Epicrates says in his Anti-Lais; in which play he also uses the following expressions concerning the celebrated Lais:- 
  But this fair Lais is both drunk and lazy, 
  And cares for nothing, save what she may eat 
  And drink all day. And she, as I do think, 
  Has the same fate the eagles have; for they, 
  When they are young, down from the mountains stoop, 
  Ravage the flocks and eat the timid hares, 
  Bearing their prey aloft with fearful might. 
  But when they're old, on temple tops they perch, 
  Hungry and helpless; and the soothsayers 
  Turn such a sight into a prodigy. 
  And so might Lais well be thought an omen; 
  For when she was a maiden, young and fresh, 
  She was quite savage with her wondrous riches; 
  And you might easier get access to 
  The satrap Pharnabazus. But at present, 
  Now that she's more advanced in years, and age 
  Has meddled with her body's round proportions, 
  'Tis easy both to see her and to scorn her. 
  Now she runs everywhere to get some drink; 
  She'll take a stater -aye, or three obols; 
  She will admit you, young or old; and is 
  Become so tame, so utterly subdued, 
  That she will take the money from your hand.

Anaxandrides also, in his Old Man's Madness, mentions Lais, and includes her with many other courtesans in a list which he gives in the following lines: 
  (A)   You know Corinthian Lais? 
  (B)   To be sure; 
  My countrywoman. 
  (A)   Well, she had a friend, 
  By name Anteia. 
  (B)   Yes; I knew her well. 
  (A)   Well, in those days Lagisce was in beauty; 
  Theolyte, too, was wondrous fair to see, 
  And seemed likely to be fairer still; 
  And Ocim?n was beautiful as any.

[27.] G   This, then, is the advice I want to give you, my friend Myrtilus; and, as we read in the Huntress of Philetaerus,- 
  Now you are old, reform those ways of yours; 
  Know you not that 'tis hardly well to die 
  In the embraces of a prostitute, 
  As men do say Phormisius perished ?

Or do you think that delightful which Timocles speaks of in his Marathonian Women ?- 
  How great the difference whether you pass the night 
  With a lawful wife or with a prostitute 
  Bah! Where's the firmness of the flesh, the freshness 
  Of breath and of complexion? Oh, ye gods! 
  What appetite it gives one not to find 
  Everything waiting, but to be constrained 
  [571] To struggle a little, and from tender hands 
  To bear soft blows and buffets; that, indeed 
  Is really pleasure.

[571] And as Cynulcus had still a good deal which he wished to say, and as Ulpianus was preparing to attack him for the sake of Myrtilus, Myrtilus, getting in ahead of him (for he hated the Syrian), said- 
  But our hopes were not so clean worn out, 
  As to need aid from bitter enemies; 
as Callimachus says. For are not we, O Cynulcus, able to defend ourselves?

  How rude you are, and boorish with your jokes! 
  Your tongue is all on the left side of your mouth; 
as Ephippus says in his Philyra. For you seem to me to be one of those men 
  Who of the Muses learnt but ill-shaped letters, 
as some one of the parody writers has it.

[28.] G   I therefore, my friends and messmates, have not, as is said in the Aurae of Metagenes, or in the Mammacythus of Aristagoras, 
  Told you of female dancers, courtesans 
  Who once were fair; and now I do not tell you 
  Of flute-playing girls, just reaching womanhood, 
  Who not unwillingly, for adequate pay, 
  Have borne the love of vulgar men; 
but I have been speaking of the real companions- that is to say, of those who are able to preserve a friendship free from trickery; whom Cynulcus does not venture to speak ill of, and who of all women are the only ones who have derived their name from friendship, or from that goddess who is named by the Athenians Aphrodite Hetaera: concerning whom Apollodorus the Athenian speaks, in his treatise on the Gods, in the following manner:- And they worship Aphrodite Hetaera, who brings together male and female companions (???????? ??? ???????)- that is to say, mistresses." Accordingly, even to this day, freeborn women and maidens call their associates and friends their ???????; as Sappho does, where she says- 
  And now with tuneful voice I'll sing 
  These pleasing songs to my companions (????????).

And in another place she says- 
  Niobe and Leto were of old 
  Affectionate companions (???????) to each other.

They also call women who prostitute themselves for money, ???????. And the verb which they use for prostituting oneself for money is ???????, not regarding the etymology of the word, but applying a more decent term to the trade; as Menander, in his Deposit, distinguishing the ??????? from the ???????, says- 
  You've done an act not suited to companions (???????), 
  But, by Zeus, far more fit for courtesans (???????), 
  These words, so near the same, do make the sense 
  Not always easily to be distinguished.

[29.] G   But concerning courtesans, Ephippus, in his Merchandise, speaks as follows: 
  And then if, when we enter through their doors, 
  They see that we are out of sorts at all, 
  They flatter us and soothe us, kiss us gently, 
  Not pressing hard as though our lips were enemies, 
  But with soft open kisses like a sparrow; 
  They sing, and comfort us, and make us cheerful, 
  And straightway banish all our care and grief, 
  And make our faces bright again with smiles.

And Eubulus, in his Campylion, introducing a courtesan of modest deportment, says- 
  How modestly she sat the while at supper! 
  Not like the rest, who make great balls of leeks, 
  And stuff their cheeks with them, and loudly crunch 
  Within their jaws large lumps of greasy meat; 
  [572] But delicately tasting of each dish, 
  In mouthfuls small, like a Milesian maiden.

And Antiphanes says in his Hydra - 
  But he, the man of whom I now was speaking, 
  Seeing a woman who lived near his house, 
  A courtesan, did fall at once in love with her; 
  She was a citizen, without a guardian 
  Or any near relations, and her manners 
  Pure, and on virtue's strictest model formed, 
  A genuine mistress (??????); for the rest of the crew 
  Bring into disrepute, by their vile manners, 
  A name which in itself has nothing wrong.

And Anaxilas, in his Neottis, says- 
  (A)   But if a woman does at all times use 
  Fair, moderate language, giving her services 
  Favourable to all who stand in need of her, 
  She from her prompt companionship (????????) does earn 
  The title of companion (??????); and you, 
  As you say rightly, have not fallen in love 
  With a vile harlot (?????), but with a companion (??????). 
  Is she not one of pure and simple manners? 
  (B)   At all events, by Zeus, she's beautiful.

[30.] G   But that systematic debaucher of youths of yours, is such a person as Alexis, or Antiphanes, represents him, in his Sleep: 
  On this account, that profligate, when supping 
  With us, will never eat an onion even, 
  So as not to annoy the object of his love.

And Ephippus has spoken very well of people of that description in his Sappho, where he says- 
  For when one in the flower of his age 
  Learns to sneak into other men's abodes, 
  And shares of meals where he has not contributed, 
  He must expect some other mode of payment.

And Aeschines the orator has said something of the same kind in his Speech against Timarchus.

[31.] G   But concerning courtesans, Philetaerus, in his Huntress, has the following lines:- 
  'Tis not for nothing that wherever we go 
  We find a temple of Hetaera there, 
  But nowhere one to any wedded wife.

I know, too, that there is a festival called the Hetaerideia, which is celebrated in Magnesia, not owing to the courtesans, but to another cause, which is mentioned by Hegesander in his Commentaries, who writes thus:- "The Magnesians celebrate a festival called Hetaerideia; and they give this account of it: that originally Jason, the son of Aeson, when he had collected the Argonauts, sacrificed to Zeus Hetaereius, and called the festival Hetaerideia.  And the Macedonian kings also celebrated the Hetaerideia." There is also a temple of Aphrodite the Prostitute (?????) at Abydus, as Pamphilus asserts:- "For when all the city was oppressed by slavery, the guards in the city, after a sacrifice on one occasion (as Cleanthus relates in his essays on Fables), having got intoxicated, took several courtesans; and one of these women, when she saw that the men were all fast asleep, taking the keys, got over the wall, and brought the news to the citizens of Abydus. And they, on this, immediately came in arms, and slew the guards, and took possession of the walls, and recovered their freedom; and to show their gratitude to the prostitute, they built a temple to Aphrodite the Prostitute."

And Alexis the Samian, in the second book of his Samian Annals, says- "The Athenian prostitutes who followed Pericles when he laid siege to Samos, having made vast sums of money by their beauty, dedicated a statue of Aphrodite at Samos, which some call Aphrodite among the Reeds, and others Aphrodite in the Marsh." [573] And Eualces, in his History of the Affairs of Ephesus, says that there is at Ephesus also a temple to Aphrodite the Courtesan (??????). And Clearchus, in the first book of his treatise on Amatory Matters, says-" Gyges the king of the Lydians was very celebrated, not only on account of his mistress while she was alive, having submitted himself and his whole dominions to her power, but also after she was dead; inasmuch as he assembled all the Lydians in the whole country, and raised that mound which is even now called the tomb of the Lydian Courtesan; building it up to a great height, so that when he was travelling in the country, inside of Mount Tmolus, wherever he was, he could always see the tomb; and it was a conspicuous object to all the inhabitants of Lydia." And Demosthenes the orator, in his Speech against Neaera (if it is a genuine one, which Apollodorus says it is), says [ 59'122 ]- "Now we have courtesans for the sake of pleasure, but concubines for the sake of daily cohabitation, and wives for the purpose of having children legitimately, and of having a faithful guardian of all our household affairs."

[32.] G   I will now mention to you, Cynulcus, an Ionian story (spinning it out, as Aeschylus' Agamemnon says,) about courtesans, beginning with the beautiful Corinth, since you have reproached me with having been a schoolmaster in that city. It is an ancient custom at Corinth (as Chamaeleon of Heracleia relates, in his treatise on Pindarus), whenever the city addresses any supplication to Aphrodite about any important matter, to employ as many courtesans as possible to join in the supplication; and they, too, pray to the goddess, and afterwards they are present at the sacrifices. And when the king of Persia was leading his army against Greece (as Theopompus also relates, and so does Timaeus, in his seventh book), the Corinthian courtesans offered prayers for the safety of Greece, going to the temple of Aphrodite. On which account, after the Corinthians had consecrated a picture to the goddess (which remains even to this day), and as in this picture they had painted the portraits of the courtesans who made this supplication at the time, and who were present afterwards, Simonides composed this epigram:- 
  These damsels, on behalf of Greece, and all 
  Their gallant countrymen, stood nobly forth, 
  Praying to Aphrodite, all-powerful goddess; 
  Nor was the queen of beauty willing ever 
  To leave the citadel of Greece to fall 
  Beneath the arrows of the unwarlike Persians.

And even private individuals sometimes vow to Aphrodite, that if they succeed in the objects for which they are offering their vows, they will bring her a stated number of courtesans.

[33.] G   As this custom, then, exists with reference to this goddess, Xenophon the Corinthian, when going to Olympia to the games, vowed that he, if he were victorious, would bring her some courtesans. And Pindarus at first wrote a panegyric on him, which begins thus [ Olymp.13 ]:- 
  Praising the house which in the Olympic games 
  Has thrice borne off the victory.

But afterwards he composed a scolium on him, which was sung at the sacrificial feasts; at the start of which he turns at once to the courtesans who joined in the sacrifice to Aphrodite, in the presence of Xenophon, while he was sacrificing to the goddess himself ; on which account he says:- 
  O queen of Cyprus' isle, 
  Come to this grove ! 
  [574] Lo, Xenophon, succeeding in his aim, 
  Brings you a band of willing maidens, 
  Dancing on a hundred feet.

And the opening lines of the song were these:- 
  O hospitable damsels, fairest train 
  Of soft Persuasion,- 
  Ornament of the wealthy Corinth, 
  Bearing in willing hands the golden drops 
  That from the frankincense distil, and flying 
  To the fair mother of the Loves, 
  Who dwells up in the sky, 
  Lovely Aphrodite,- you do bring to us 
  Comfort and hope in danger, that we may 
  Hereafter, in the delicate beds of Love, 
  Heap the long-wished-for fruits of joy, 
  Lovely and necessary to all mortal men.

And after having begun in this manner, he proceeds to say:- 
  But now I marvel, and wait anxiously 
  To see what will my masters say of me, 
  Who thus begin 
  My scolium with this amatory preface, 
  Willing companion of these willing damsels.

And it is plain here that the poet, while addressing the courtesans in this way, was in some doubt as to the light in which it would appear to the Corinthians; but, trusting to his own genius, he proceeds with the following verse:- 
  We teach pure gold on a well-tried lyre.

And Alexis, in his Loving Woman, tells us that the courtesans at Corinth celebrate a festival of their own, called Aphrodisia; where he says - 
  The city at the time was celebrating 
  The Aphrodisia of the courtesans; 
  This is a different festival from that 
  At which the free women are present: and then 
  It is the custom on those days that all 
  The courtesans should feast with us in common.

[34.] G   But at Lacedaemon (as Polemon Periegetes says, in his treatise on the Offerings at Lacedaemon,) there is a statue of a very celebrated courtesan, named Cottina, who, he tells us, consecrated a brazen cow; and Polemon's words are these:- "And the statue of Cottina the courtesan, on account of whose celebrity there is still a brothel which is called by her name, near the hill on which the temple of Dionysus stands, is a conspicuous object, well known to many of the citizens. And her votive offering is beyond the statue of Athene Chalcioecus - a brazen cow, and also the before-mentioned image."

And the handsome Alcibiades, of whom one of the comic poets said:- 
  And then the delicate Alcibiades, 
  O earth and all the gods! whom Lacedaemon 
  Desires to catch in his adulteries, 
though he was beloved by the wife of Agis, used to go and hold his revels at the doors of the courtesans, leaving all the Lacedaemonian and Athenian women. He also fell in love with Medontis of Abydus, from the mere report of her beauty; and sailing to the Hellespont with Axiochus, who was a lover of his on account of his beauty (as Lysias the orator states in his speech against him), he allowed Axiochus to share her with him. Moreover, Alcibiades used always to carry about two other courtesans with him in all his expeditions, namely, Damasandra, the mother of the younger Lais, and Theodote; who, after he was dead, buried him in Melissa, a village of Phrygia, after he had been overwhelmed by the treachery of Pharnabazus. And we ourselves saw the tomb of Alcibiades at Melissa, when we went from Synnada to Metropolis; and at that tomb there is sacrificed an ox every year, by the command of that most excellent emperor Hadrianus, who also erected on the tomb a statue of Alcibiades in Parian marble.

[35.] G   [575] And we must not wonder at people having on some occasions fallen in love with others from the mere report of their beauty, when Chares of Mytilene, in the tenth book of his History of Alexander, says that some people have even seen in dreams those whom they have never beheld before, and fallen in love with them in this way. And he writes as follows:- "Hystaspes had a younger brother whose name was Zariadres; and they were both men of great personal beauty. And the story told concerning them by the natives of the country is, that they were the offspring of Aphrodite and Adonis. Now Hystaspes was ruler of Media, and of the lower country adjoining it; and Zariadres was ruler of the country above the Caspian gates as far as the river Tanais. Now the daughter of Omartes, the king of the Marathi, a tribe dwelling on the other side of the Tanais, was named Odatis. And concerning her it is written in the Histories, that she in her sleep beheld Zariadres, and fell in love with him; and that the very same thing happened to him with respect to her. And so for a long time they were in love with one another, simply on account of the visions which they had seen in their dreams. And Odatis was the most beautiful of all the women in Asia; and Zariadres also was very handsome. Accordingly, when Zariadres sent to Omartes and expressed a desire to marry the girl, Omartes would not agree to it, because he did not have any male offspring; for he wished to give her to one of his own people about his court.

"Not long afterwards, Omartes, having assembled all the chief men of his kingdom and all his friends and relations, held a marriage feast. But he had not said beforehand to whom he was going to give his daughter. And as the wine went round, her father summoned Odatis to the banquet, and said, in the hearing of all the guests,- 'We, my daughter Odatis, are now celebrating your marriage feast; so now do you look around, and survey all those who are present, and then take a golden goblet and fill it, and give it to the man to whom you like to be married; for you shall be called his wife.' And she, having looked round upon them all, went away weeping, being anxious to see Zariadres, for she had sent him word that her marriage feast was about to be celebrated. But he, being encamped on the Tanais, and leaving the army encamped there without being perceived, crossed the river with his charioteer alone ; and going by night in his chariot, passed through the city, having gone about eight hundred stades without stopping. And when he got near the town in which the marriage festival was being celebrated, and leaving, in some place near, his chariot with the charioteer, he went forward by himself, clad in a Scythian robe. And when he arrived at the palace, and seeing Odatis standing in front of the sideboard in tears, while she filled the goblet very slowly, he stood near her and said, 'Odatis, here I have come, as you requested me to, - I, Zariadres.' And she, perceiving a stranger, and a handsome man, and that he resembled the man whom she had beheld in her sleep, being exceedingly glad, gave him the bowl. And he, seizing on her, led her away to his chariot, and fled away, having Odatis with him. And the servants and the handmaidens, knowing their love, said not a word. And when her father ordered them to summon her, they said that they did not know which way she had gone.

"And the story of this love is often told by the barbarians who dwell in Asia, and is exceedingly admired; and they have painted representations of the story in their temples and palaces, and also in their private houses. And a great many of the princes in those countries give their daughters the name of Odatis."

[36.] G   [576] Aristotle also, in his Constitution of the Massilians, mentions a similar circumstance as having taken place, writing as follows:- "The Phocaeans in Ionia, having consulted the oracle, founded Massilia. And Euxenus the Phocaean was connected by ties of hospitality with Nanus; this was the name of the king of that country. This Nanus was celebrating the marriage feast of his daughter, and invited Euxenus, who happened to be in the neighbourhood, to the feast. And the marriage was to be conducted in the following manner: after the supper was over the girl was to come in, and to give a goblet full of wine properly mixed to whichever of the suitors who were present she chose; and to whomsoever she gave it, he was to be her bridegroom. And when the girl came in, whether it was by chance or whether it was for any other reason, she gave the goblet to Euxenus. And the name of the maiden was Petta. And when the cup had been given in this way, and her father (thinking that she had been directed by the Deity in her giving of it) had consented that Euxenus should have her, he took her for his wife, and cohabited with her, changing her name to Aristoxene. And the family which is descended from that girl remains in Massilia to this day, and is known as the Protiadae; for Protis was the name of the son of Euxenus and Aristoxene."

[37.] G   And did not Themistocles, as Idomeneus relates, harness a chariot full of courtesans and drive with them into the city when the market was full? And the courtesans were Lamia and Scione and Satyra and Nanni?n. And was not Themistocles himself the son of a courtesan, whose name was Abroton?n? as Amphicrates relates in his treatise on Illustrious Men- 
  Abroton?n was but a Thracian woman, 
  But for the weal of Greece 
  She was the mother of the great Themistocles.

But Neanthes of Cyzicus, in his third and fourth books of his History of Greek Affairs, says that he was the son of Euterpe.

And when Cyrus the younger was making his expedition against his brother, did he not carry with him a courtesan of Phocaea, who was a very clever and very beautiful woman? and Zenophanes says that her name was originally Milto, but that it was afterwards changed to Aspasia. And a Milesian concubine also accompanied him. And did not the great Alexander keep Thais about him, who was an Athenian courtesan? And Cleitarchus speaks of her as having been the cause that the palace of Persepolis was burnt down. And this Thais, after the death of Alexander, married Ptolemy, who became the first king of Egypt, and she bore him sons, Leontiscus and Lagus, and a daughter named Eirene, who was married to Eunostus, the king of Soli, a town of Cyprus. And the second king of Egypt, Ptolemy Philadelphus by name, as Ptolemy Euergetes relates in the third book of his Commentaries, had a great many mistresses,- namely, Didyme, who was a native of the country, and very beautiful; and Bilistiche; and, besides them, Agathocleia, and Stratonice, who had a great monument on the sea-shore, near Eleusis; and Myrti?n, and a great many more; as he was a man excessively addicted to amatory pleasures.  # And Polybius, in the fourteenth book of his History [ 14.11 ], says that there are a great many statues of a woman named Cleino, who was his cup-bearer, in Alexandria, clothed in a tunic only, and holding a cornucopia in her hand. "And are not," says he, "the finest houses called by the names of Myrti?n, and Mnesis, and Potheine? and yet Mnesis was only a female flute-player, and so was Potheine, and Myrti?n was one of the most notorious and common prostitutes in the city."

[577]  # Was there not also Agathocleia the courtesan, who had great power over king Ptolemy Philopator? in fact, was it not she who was the ruin of his whole kingdom? And Eumachus of Neapolis, in the second book of his History of Hannibal, says that Hieronymus, the tyrant of Syracuse, fell in love with one of the common prostitutes who followed her trade in a brothel, whose name was Peitho, and married her, and made her queen of Syracuse.

[38.] G   And Timotheus, who was general of the Athenians, with a very high reputation, was the son of a courtesan, a Thracian by birth, but, except that she was a courtesan, of very excellent character; for when women of this class do behave modestly, they are superior to those who give themselves airs on account of their virtue. But Timotheus being on one occasion reproached as being the son of a mother of that character, said,- "But I am much obliged to her, because it is owing to her that I am the son of Conon." And Carystius, in his Historical Commentaries, says that Philetaerus the king of Pergamum, and of all that country which is now called the New Province, was the son of a woman named Boa, who was a flute-player and a courtesan, a Paphlagonian by birth. And Aristophon the orator, who in the archonship of Eucleides [ 403 B.C. ] proposed a law, that every one who was not born of a woman who was a citizen should be accounted a bastard, was himself convicted, by Calliades the comic poet, of having children by a courtesan named Choregis, as the same Carystius relates in the third book of his Commentaries.

 # Besides all these men, was not Demetrius Poliorcetes evidently in love with Lamia the flute-player, by whom he had a daughter named Phila? And Polemon, in his treatise On the Painted Stoa at Sicyon, says that Lamia was the daughter of Cleanor an Athenian, and that she built the before-mentioned colonnade for the people of Sicyon. Demetrius was also in love with Leaena, and she was also an Athenian courtesan; and with a great many other women besides.

[39.] G    # And Machon the comic poet, in his play entitled the Chriae, speaks thus:- 
  But as Leaena was by nature formed 
  To give her lovers most exceeding pleasure, 
  And was besides much favoured by Demetrius, 
  They say that Lamia also gratified 
  The king; and when he praised her grace and quickness, 
  The woman answered: And besides you can, 
  If you do wish, subdue a lioness (???????).

But Lamia was always very witty and prompt in repartee, as also was Gnathaena, whom we shall mention presently.  And again Machon writes thus aboout Lamia:- 
  Demetrius the king was once displaying 
  Amid his cups a great variety 
  Of kinds of perfumes to his Lamia: 
  Now Lamia was a female flute-player, 
  With whom 'tis always said Demetrius 
  Was very much in love. But when she scoffed 
  At all his perfumes, and, moreover, treated 
  The monarch with exceeding insolence, 
  He bade a slave bring some cheap unguent, while 
  With his hand he felt himself, and smeared his fingers, 
  And said, "At least smell this, O Lamia, 
  And see how much this scent does beat all others." 
  She laughingly replied: "But know, O king, 
  That smell does seem to me the worst of all." 
  "But," said Demetrius, "I swear, by the gods, 
  That 'tis produced from a right royal nut."

[40.] G   But Ptolemaeus the son of Agesarchus, in his History of Philopator, [578] giving a list of the mistresses of the different kings, says- "Philippus the Macedonian promoted Philinna, the dancing woman, by whom he had Arrhidaeus, who was king of Macedonia after Alexander. And Demetrius Poliorcetes, besides the women who have already been mentioned, had a mistress named Mania; and Antigonus had one named Demo, by whom he had a son named Alcyoneus;  # and Seleucus the younger had two, whose names were Mysta and Nysa." But Heracleides Lembus, in the thirty-sixth book of his History, says that Demo was the mistress of Demetrius; and that his father Antigonus was also in love with her: and that he put to death Oxythemis as having shared in many of the crimes of Demetrius; and he also put to the torture and executed the maid-servants of Demo.

[41.] G   But concerning the name of Mania, which we have just mentioned, the same Machon says this: 
  Some one perhaps of those who hear this now, 
  May fairly wonder how it came to pass 
  That an Athenian woman had a name, 
  Or even a nickname, such as Mania. 
  For 'tis disgraceful for a woman thus 
  To bear a Phrygian name; she being, too, 
  A courtesan from the very heart of Greece. 
  And why was this permitted in the city of Athens, 
  By which all other nations are much swayed? 
  The fact is that her name from early childhood 
  Was this- Melitta. And as she grew up 
  A trifle shorter than her playfellows, 
  But with a sweet voice and engaging manners, 
  And with such beauty and excellence of face 
  As made a deep impression upon all men, 
  She'd many lovers, foreigners and citizens. 
  So that when any conversation 
  Arose about this woman, each man said, 
  The fair Melitta was his madness (?????). Aye, 
  And she herself contributed to this name; 
  For when she jested she would oft repeat 
  This word ?????; and when in sport she blamed 
  Or praised any one, she would bring in, 
  In either sentence, this word ?????. 
  So some one of her lovers, dwelling on 
  The word, appears to have nicknamed the girl 
  Mania; and this extra name prevailed 
  More than her real one. It seems, besides, 
  That Mania was afflicted with the stone, 
  But Gnathaena was reproached by Diphilus, 
  Because she soiled the bedclothes. And once 
  When Gnathaena was chiding Mania, she said- 
  "How so, girl, even if you did have a stone?" 
  And Mania replied, "I should have given it to you, 
  You wretch, so you could wipe yourself clean."

[42.] G   And that Mania was also excellent in witty repartee, Machon tells us in these verses about her,- 
  There was a victor in the pancratium, 
  Named Leontiscus, who loved Mania, 
  And kept her with him as his lawful wife; 
  But finding afterwards that she did play 
  The harlot with Antenor, was indignant: 
  But she replied,-" My darling, never mind; 
  I only wanted just to feel and prove, 
  In a single night, how great the strength might be 
  Of two such athletes, victors at Olympia." 
  [579] They say again that Mania once was asked, 
  By King Demetrius, for a perfect sight 
  Of her fair buttocks; and she, in return, 
  Demanded that he should grant her a favour. 
  When he agreed, she turned her back, and said,- 
  "O son of Agamemnon, now the Gods 
  Grant you to see what you so long have wished for." [ Sophocles, Electra_2 ] 
  On one occasion, too, a foreigner, 
  Who a deserter was believed to be, 
  Had come by chance to Athens; and he sent 
  For Mania, and gave her all she asked. 
  It happened that he had procured for supper 
  Some of those table-jesters, common buffoons, 
  Who always raise a laugh to please their feeders; 
  And wishing to appear a witty man, 
  Used to politest conversation, 
  While Mania was sporting gracefully, 
  As was her wont, and often rising up 
  To reach a dish of hare, he tried to raise 
  A joke upon her, and thus spoke,- "My friends, 
  Tell me, I pray you by the Gods, what animal 
  You think runs fastest over the mountain-tops?" 
  "Why, my love, a deserter," answered Mania. 
  Another time, when Mania came to see him, 
  She laughed at the deserter, telling him, 
  That once in battle he had lost his shield. 
  But this brave soldier, looking somewhat fierce 
  Sent her away. And as she was departing, 
  She said, "My love, don't be so much annoyed; 
  For by Aphrodite, it was not you who lost the shield, 
  When you ran away, but he who lent it you." 
  Another time they say a man who was 
  A thorough profligate, did entertain 
  Mania at supper; and when he questioned her, 
  "Do you like being up or down the best?" 
  She laughed, and said, "I'd rather be up, my friend, 
  For I'm afraid, lest, if I lay me down, 
  You'd bite my plaited hair from off my head."

[43.] G   But Machon has also collected the witty sayings of other courtesans too; and it will not be unseasonable to enumerate some of them now. Accordingly he mentions Gnathaena thus:- 
  Diphilus once was drinking with Gnathaena. 
  Said he, "Your cup is somewhat cold, Gnathaena;" 
  And she replied, "'Tis no great wonder, Diphilus, 
  For we take care to put some of your plays in it." 
  Diphilus was once invited to a banquet 
  At fair Gnathaena's house, as men do say, 
  On the day of Aphrodite's festival- 
  (He being a man above her other lovers 
  Beloved by her, though she concealed her flame), 
  He came accordingly, and brought with him 
  Two jars of Chian wine, and four, quite full, 
  Of wine from Thasos; perfumes, too, and crowns; 
  Sweetmeats and venison; fillets for the head; 
  Fish, and a cook, and a female flute-player. 
  In the meantime a Syrian friend of hers 
  Sent her some snow, and one saperda; she 
  Being ashamed lest any one should hear 
  She had received such gifts, and, above all men, 
  Fearing lest Diphilus should get at them, 
  And show her up in one of his comedies, 
  She bade a slave to carry off at once 
  The salt fish to the men who wanted salt, 
  As every one did know; the snow she told him 
  To mix with the wine unseen by any one. 
  [580] And then she bade the boy to fill the cup 
  With ten full cyathi of wine, and bear it 
  At once to Diphilus. He eagerly 
  Received the cup, and drained it to the bottom, 
  And, marvelling at the delicious coolness, 
  Said- "By Athene, and by all the gods, 
  You must, Gnathaena, be allowed by all 
  To have a most deliciously cool well." 
  "Yes," said she, "for we carefully put in, 
  From day to day, the prologues of your plays." 
  A slave who had been flogged, whose back was marked 
  With heavy scars, was once, as it fell out, 
  Reposing with Gnathaena:- then, as she 
  Embraced him, she found out how rough all over 
  His back did feel. "Oh wretched man," said she, 
  "In what engagement did you get these wounds?" 
  He in a few words answered her, and said, 
  "That when a boy, once playing with his playmates, 
  He'd fallen backwards into the fire by accident." 
  "Well," said she, "if you were so wanton then, 
  You well deserved to be flogged, my friend."' 
  Gnathaena once was supping with Dexithea, 
  Who was a courtesan as well as she; 
  And when Dexithea put aside with care 
  Nearly all the daintiest morsels for her mother, 
  She said, "I swear by Artemis, had I known 
  How you went on, Dexithea, I would rather 
  Have gone to supper with your mother than you." 
  When this Gnathaena was advanced in years, 
  Hastening, as all might see, towards the grave, 
  They say she once event out into the market, 
  And looked at all the fish, and asked the price 
  Of every article she saw. And seeing 
  A handsome butcher standing at his stall, 
  Just in the flower of youth,- "Oh, in God's name, 
  Tell me, my youth, what is your price (??? ?????) to-day ?" 
  He laughed, and said, " Why, if I stoop, three obols." 
  "But who," said she, "did give you leave, you wretch, 
  To use your Carian weights in Attica?" 
  Stratocles once made all his friends a present 
  Of kids and shell-fish greatly salted, seeming 
  To have dressed them carefully, so that his friends 
  Should the next morning be overwhelmed with thirst, 
  And thus protract their drinking, so that he 
  Might draw from them some ample contributions. 
  Therefore Gnathaena said to one of her lovers, 
  Seeing him wavering about his offerings, 
  "After the kids, Stratocles brings a storm." 
  Gnathaena, seeing once a thin young man, 
  Of black complexion, lean as any scarecrow, 
  Reeking with oil, and shorter than his fellows, 
  Called him in jest Adonis. When the youth 
  Answered her in a rude and violent manner, 
  She looking on her daughter who was with her, 
  Said, "Ah! it serves me right for my mistake." 
  They say that one fine day a youth from Pontus 
  Was sleeping with Gnathaena, and at morn 
  He asked her to display her buttocks to him. 
  But she replied, " You have no time, for now 
  [581] It is the hour to drive the pigs to feed."

[44.] G   He also mentions the following sayings of Gnathaeni?n, who was the grand-daughter of Gnathaena: 
  It happened once that a very aged satrap, 
  Full ninety years of are, had come to Athens. 
  And on the feast of Cronus he beheld 
  Gnathaeni?n with Gnathaena going out 
  From a fair temple sacred to Aphrodite, 
  And noticing her form and grace of motion, 
  He just inquired "How much she asked a night?" 
  Gnathaena, looking on his purple robe, 
  And princely bodyguard, said, "A thousand drachmas." 
  He, as if smitten with a mortal wound, 
  Said, "I perceive, because of all these soldiers, 
  You look upon me as a captured enemy; 
  But take five minae, and agree with me, 
  And let them get a bed prepared for us." 
  She, as the satrap seemed a witty man, 
  Received his terms, and said, "Give what you like, 
  O father, for I know most certainly, 
  You'll give my daughter twice as much at night." 
  There was at Athens once a handsome smith, 
  When she, Gnathaeni?n, had almost abandoned 
  Her trade, and would no longer common be, 
  Moved by the love of the actor Andronicus; 
  (But at this moment he was gone away, 
  After she'd brought him a male child;) this smith 
  Then long besought the fair Gnathaeni?n 
  To fix her price; and though she long refused, 
  By long entreaty and liberality, 
  At last he won her over to consent. 
  But being but a rude and ill-bred clown, 
  He, one day sitting with some friends of his 
  In a leather-cutter's shop, began to talk 
  About Gnathaeni?n to divert their leisure, 
  Saying that he never consorted with her 
  In any other way, except that she rode 
  On top of him, five times over. 
  But after this, when Andronicus came 
  From Corinth back again, and heard the news, 
  He bitterly reproached her, and at supper 
  He said, with just complaint, unto Gnathaeni?n, 
  That she had never granted him such liberties 
  As this flogged slave had had allowed to him. 
  And then they say Gnathaeni?n thus replied: 
  That she was her own mistress, and the smith 
  Was so begrimed with soot and dirt that she 
  Did not wish to embrace him; but after receiving 
  A large sum of gold, she gave in to his request, 
  And cleverly contrived to touch the part of him, 
  Which, though small, stuck out the furthest. 
  One day they say Gnathaeni?n, at supper, 
  Would not kiss Andronicus when he wished, 
  [582] Though she had done so every day before; 
  But she was angry that he gave her nothing. 
  Said he, on this, "Gnathaena, don't you see 
  How haughtily your daughter's treating me?" 
  And she, indignant, said, " You wretched girl, 
  Take him and kiss him if he wishes it." 
  But she replied, " Why should I kiss him, mother, 
  Who does no good to any one in the house, 
  But seeks to have hollow Argos all for free?" 
  Once, on a day of festival, Gnathaeni?n 
  Went down to the Peiraeus to a lover, 
  Who was a foreign merchant, riding cheaply 
  On a poor mule, and having after her 
  Three donkeys, three maidservants, and one nurse. 
  Then, at a narrow spot in the road, they met 
  One of those poor wrestlers, men who contrive 
  To lose their battles, in return for pay; 
  And as he could not pass by easily, 
  Being crowded up, he cried- "You wretched man, 
  You donkey-driver, if you get not quickly 
  Out of my way, I will upset these women, 
  And all the donkeys and the mule to boot." 
  But quick Gnathaeni?n said, "My friend, I pray you, 
  Don't be so valiant now, when you have never 
  Done any feat of spirit or strength before."

[45.] G   And afterwards, Machon gives us the following anecdotes: 
  They say that Lais the Corinthian, 
  Once when she saw Euripides in a garden, 
  Holding a tablet and a pen attached to it, 
  Cried out to him, "Now, answer me, my poet, 
  What was your meaning when you wrote in your play [ Medea_1346 ], 
  'Away, you shameless doer' ?" And Euripides, 
  Amazed, and wondering at her audacity, 
  Said, "Why, you seem to me to be yourself 
  A shameless doer." And she, laughing, answered, 
  "How shameless, if my partners do not think so?" 
  Glyceri?n once received from some lover 
  A new Corinthian cloak (??????) with purple sleeves, 
  And gave it to a fuller. Afterwards, 
  When she thought he'd had time enough to clean it, 
  She sent her maidservant to fetch it back, 
  Giving her money, that she might pay for it. 
  But, said the fuller, "You must bring me first 
  Three quarters of the oil (???????), for want of that 
  Is what has hindered me from finishing." 
  The maid went back and told her mistress all. 
  "Wretch that I am! " Glyceri?n said, "for he 
  Is going to fry my cloak like any herring." 
  Demophoon once, the friend of Sophocles, 
  While a young man, fell furiously in love 
  With Nico, called the Goat, though she was old: 
  And she had earned this name of Goat, because 
  She quite devoured once a mighty friend of hers, 
  Named Thallus, when he came to Attica 
  To buy some Chelidonian figs, and also 
  To export some honey from the Hymettian hill. 
  And it is said this woman had fair buttocks, 
  And when Demophoon tried to hold them, 
  "A pretty thing," said she, "that what you get 
  [583] From me, you may present to Sophocles." 
  Callisto once, who was nicknamed the Sow, 
  Was fiercely quarrelling with her own mother, 
  Who also was nicknamed the Crow. Gnathaena 
  Appeased the quarrel, and when asked the cause of it, 
  Said, " What else could it be, but that one Crow 
  Was finding fault with the blackness of the other?" 
  Men say that Hippe once, the courtesan, 
  Had a lover named Theodotus, a man 
  Who at the time was prefect of the granaries 
  And she on one occasion late in the evening 
  Came to a banquet of King Ptolemy, 
  And she'd been often used to drink with him 
  So, as she now was very late, she said, 
  "I'm very thirsty, papa Ptolemy, 
  So let the cup-bearer pour me four cotylae 
  Into a larger cup." The king replied, 
  "You must have it in a platter, for you seem 
  Already, Hippe, to have had plenty of hay." 
  A man named Moerichus was courting Phryne, 
  The Thespian girl. And, as she required 
  A mina, "'Tis a mighty sum," said Moerichus, 
  "Did you not yesterday charge a foreigner 
  Two little pieces of gold?" "Wait till I want you," 
  Said she, "and I will take the same from you." 
  'Tis said that Nico, who was called the Goat, 
  Once when a man named Python had deserted her, 
  And taken up with the great fat Euardis, 
  But after a time did send again for her, 
  Said to the slave who came to fetch her, "Now 
  That Python is well sated with his swine, 
  Does he desire to return to a goat?"

[46.] G   Up to this point we have been recapitulating the things mentioned by Machon. For our beautiful Athens has produced such a number of courtesans (of whom I will tell you as many anecdotes as I can) as no other populous city ever produced. At all events, Aristophanes of Byzantium counted up a hundred and thirty-five, and Apollodorus a still greater number; and Gorgias enumerated still more, saying that, among a great many more, these eminent ones had been omitted by Aristophanes- namely, one who was surnamed Paroinos, and Lampyris, and Euphrosyne: and this last was the daughter of a fuller. And, besides these, he has omitted Megisto, Agallis, Thaunari?n, Theocleia (and she was nicknamed the Crow), Lenaetocystus, Astra, Gnathaena, and her grand-daughter Gnathaeni?n, and Sige, and Grymaea, and Thryallis, and Chimaera, and Lampas. But Diphilus the comic poet was violently in love with Gnathaena, (as has been already stated [ 579'e ], and as Lynceus the Samian relates in his Commentaries;) and so once, when on the stage he had acted very badly, and was turned out (???????) of the theatre, and, for all that, came to Gnathaena as if nothing had happened; and when he, after he had arrived, begged Gnathaena to wash his feet, "Why do you want that ?" said she; "were you not carried (???????) here?" And Gnathaena was very ready with her repartees. And there were other courtesans who had a great opinion of themselves, paying attention to education, and spending a part of their time on literature; so that they were very ready with their rejoinders and replies.

[584]  # Accordingly, when on one occasion Stilpon, at a banquet, was accusing Glycera of seducing the young men of the city, (as Satyrus mentions in his Lives,) Glycera took him up and said, "You and I are accused of the same thing, O Stilpon; for they say that you corrupt all who come to you, by teaching them profitless and amorous sophistries; and they accuse me of the same thing: for if people waste their time, and are treated ill, it makes no difference whether they are living with a philosopher or with a harlot." For, according to Agathon, 
  It does not follow, because a woman's body 
  Is void of strength, that her mind, too, is weak.

[47.] G   And Lynceus has recorded many repartees of Gnathaena. There was a parasite who used to live upon an old woman, and kept himself in very good condition; and Gnathaena, seeing him, said, "My young friend, you appear to be in very good case." "What then do you think," said he, "that I should be if I slept by myself?" "Why, I think you would starve," said she. Once, when Pausanias, who was nicknamed Laccus, was dancing, he fell into a cask. "The cellar (??????)," says Gnathaena, "has fallen into the cask." On one occasion, some one put a very little wine into a wine-cooler, and said that it was sixteen years old. "It is very little of its age," said she, "to be as old as that." Once at a drinking party, some young men were fighting about her, and beating one another, and she said to the one who was worsted, "Be of good cheer, my boy; for it is not a contest to be decided by laurel, but by silver." There was a man who once gave her daughter a mina, and never brought her anything more, though he came to see her very often. "Do you think, my boy," said she, "that now you have once paid your mina, you are to come here for ever, as if you were going to Hippomachus the trainer?" On one occasion, when Phryne said to her, with some bitterness, "What would become of you if you had the stone?" "I would give it to you," said she, "to wipe yourself with." For it was said that Gnathaena was liable to the stone, while the other suffered from diarrhoea. On one occasion, some men were drinking in her house, and were eating some lentils dressed with onions (?????????); as the maidservant was clearing the table, and putting some of the lentils in her bosom (??????), Gnathaena said, "She is thinking of making some bosom-lentils (?????????)." Once, when Andronicus the tragic actor had been acting his part in the representation of the Epigoni with great applause, and was coming to a drinking party at her house, and sent a boy forward to bid her make preparation to receive him, she said- "O cursed boy, what word is this you've spoken?" And once, when a chattering fellow was relating that he was just come from the Hellespont, "Why, then," said she, " did you not go to the first city in that country?" and when he asked what city, "To Sigeium," said she. Once, when a man came to see her, and saw some eggs on a dish, and said, "Are these raw, Gnathaena, or boiled ?" "They are made of brass, my boy," said she. On one occasion, when Chaerephon came to sup with her without an invitation, Gnathaena pledged him in a cup of wine. "Take it," said she, "you proud fellow." And he said, "I proud?" "Who can be more so," said she, "when you come without even being invited?"  And Nico, who was nicknamed the Goat (as Lynceus tells us), once when she met a parasite, who was very thin in consequence of a long sickness, said to him, "How lean you are." "No wonder," says he; " for what do you think is all that I have had to eat these three days ?" "Why, a leather bottle," says she, "or perhaps your shoes."

[48.] G   There was a courtesan named Metaneira; and when Democles the parasite, who was nicknamed Lagynion, fell down in a lot of whitewash, she said, "Yes, for you have devoted yourself to a place where there are pebbles." And when he sprung upon a couch which was near him, " Take care," said she, " lest you get upset." These sayings are recorded by Hegesander. [585] And Aristodemus, in the second book of his Laughable Records, says that Gnathaena was hired by two men, a soldier and a branded slave; and so when the soldier, in his rude manner, called her a cistern, "How can I be so?" said she; "is it because two rivers, Lycus and Eleutherus, fall into me?" On one occasion, when some poor lovers of the daughter of Gnathaena came to feast at her house, and threatened to throw it down, saying that they had brought spades and mattocks on purpose; "But," said Gnathaena, "if you had those implements, you should have pawned them, and brought some money with you."  And Gnathaena was always very neat and witty in all she said; and she even compiled a code of laws for banquets, according to which lovers were to be admitted to her and to her daughters, in imitation of the philosophers, who had drawn up similar documents. And Callimachus has recorded this code of hers in the third Catalogue of Laws which he has given; and he has quoted the first words of it as follows:- "This law has been compiled, being fair and equitable; and it is written in three hundred and twenty-three verses."

[49.] G   But a slave who had been flogged hired Callisti?n, who was nicknamed Poor Helene; and as it was summer, and he was lying down naked, she, seeing the marks of the whip, said, "Where did you get this, you unhappy man ?" and he said, "Some broth was spilt over me when I was a boy." And she said, "It must have been made of leather thongs."  # And once, when Menander the poet had failed with one of his plays, and came to her house, Glycera brought him some milk, and recommended him to drink it. But he said he would rather not, for there was some scum (?????) on it. But she replied, "Blow it away, and take what there is beneath."

Thais said once to a boastful lover of hers, who had borrowed some goblets from a great many people, and said that he meant to break them up, and make others of them, "You will destroy the characteristics of each of them." Leonti?n was once sitting at table with a lover of hers, when Glycera came in to supper; and as the man began to pay more attention to Glycera, Leonti?n was much annoyed: and presently, when her friend turned round, and asked her what she was vexed at, she said, "The newcomer (? ??????) pains me."

A lover of hers once sent his seal to Lais the Corinthian, and desired her to come to him; but she said, "I cannot come; it is only clay."  Thais was one day going to a lover of hers, who smelt like a goat; and when some one asked her whither she was going, she said- 
  To dwell with Aegeus, great Pandion's son. [ Euripides, Medea_1385 ]

Phryne, too, was once supping with a man of the same description, and, lifting up the hide of a pig, she said, "Take it, and eat it (?????)" And once, when one of her friends sent her some wine, which was very good, but the quantity was small; and when he told her that it was ten years old; "It is very little of its age," said she. And once, when the question was asked at a certain banquet, why it is that wreaths are hung up about banqueting-rooms, she said, "Because they charm the spirits." And once, when a slave, who had been flogged, was giving himself airs as a young man towards her, and saying that he had been often entangled, she pretended to look vexed; and when he asked her the reason, "I am jealous of you," said she, "because you have been so often smitten." Once a very covetous lover of hers was coaxing her, and saying to her, "You are the Aphrodite of Praxiteles;" "And you," said she, "are the Eros of Pheidias."

[50.] G   And as I am aware that some of those men who have been involved in the administration of affairs of state have mentioned courtesans, either accusing or excusing them, I will enumerate some instances of those who have done so. For Demosthenes, in his speech against Androtion [ 22'56 ], mentions Sinope and Phanostrate; [586] and respecting Sinope, Herodicus the pupil of Crates says, in the sixth book of his treatise on People mentioned in the Comic Poets, that she was called Abydus, because she was an old woman. And Antiphanes mentions her in his Arcadian, and in his Gardener, and it his Sempstress, and in his Female Fisher, and in his Chick. And Alexis mentions her in his Cleobuline, and Callicrates speaks of her in his Moschion; and concerning Phanostrate Apollodorus, in his treatise on Courtesans at Athens, says that she was called Phtheiropyle, because she used to stand at the, door (????) and hunt for lice (???????).

And in his oration against Aristagora, Hypereides says- "And again you have named, in the same manner, the animals called aphyae."  Now, aphyae, besides meaning anchovies, was also a nickname for some courtesans; concerning whom the before-mentioned Apollodorus says- "Stagoni?n and Anthis were two sisters, and they were called Aphyae, because they were white, and thin, and had large eyes." And Antiphanes, in his book on Courtesans, says that Nicostratis was called Aphya for the same reason. And the same Hypereides, in his speech against Mantitheus, who was being prosecuted for an assault, speaks in the following manner respecting Glycera- "Bringing with him Glycera the daughter of Thalassis in a pair-horse chariot." But it is uncertain whether this is the same Glycera who was the mistress of Harpalus; concerning whom Theopompus speaks in his treatise On the Chian Letter, saying that after the death of Pythionice, Harpalus sent for Glycera to come to him from Athens; and when she came, she lived in the palace which is at Tarsus, and was honoured with royal honours by the populace, and was called queen; and an edict was issued, forbidding any one to present Harpalus with a crown, without at the same time presenting Glycera with another. And at Rhossus, he went so far as to erect a brazen statue of her by the side of his own statue. And Cleitarchus has given the same account in his History of Alexander. But the author of Agen, a satyric drama, (whoever he was, whether it was Python of Catana, or king Alexander himself;) says- 
  And now they say that Harpalus has sent them 
  Unnumbered sacks of corn, no fewer than 
  Those sent by Agen, and is made a citizen: 
  But this was Glycera's corn, and it may be 
  Ruin to them, and not a harlot's earnest.

[51.] G   And Lysias, in his oration against Lais, if, indeed, the speech is a genuine one, mentions these circumstances- "Philyra abandoned the trade of a harlot when she was still quite young; and so did Scione, and Hippaphesis, and Theocleia, and Psamathe, and Lagisca, and Antheia." But perhaps, instead of Antheia, we ought to read Anteia. For I do not find any mention made by any one of a harlot named Antheia. But there is a whole play named after Anteia, by either Eunicus or Philyllius. And the author of the oration against Neaera, whoever he was, also mentions her. But in the oration against Philonides, who was being prosecuted for an assault, Lysias, if at least it is a genuine speech of his, mentions also a courtesan called Nais. And in his speech against Medon, for perjury, he mentions one by the name of Anticyra; but this was only a nickname given to a woman, whose real name was Hoia, as Antiphanes informs us in his treatise On Courtesans, where he says that she was called Anticyra, because she was in the habit of drinking with men who were crazy and mad; or else because she was at one time the mistress of Nicostratus the physician, and he, when he died, left her a great quantity of hellebore, and nothing else. Lycurgus, also, in his oration against Leocrates [ 1'17 ], mentions a courtesan named Eirenis, as being the mistress of Leocrates. [587] And Hypereides mentions Nanni?n in his oration against Patrocles. And we have already mentioned that she used to be nicknamed the Goat, because she had ruined Thallus the innkeeper. And that the goats are very fond of the young shoots of the olive (??????), on which account the animal is never allowed to approach the Acropolis, and is also never sacrificed to Athene, is a fact which we shall mention hereafter. But Sophocles, in his play called The Shepherds, mentions that this animal does browse upon the young shoots, speaking as follows- 
  For early in the morning, before I saw 
  Any of the farmers here about, 
  As I was bringing to the goat a shoot (??????) 
  Fresh plucked, I saw the army marching on 
  By the projecting headland.

Alexis also mentions Nanni?n, in his Tarentines, thus- 
  But Nanni?n is mad for love of Dionysus,- 
jesting upon her as addicted to intoxication. And Menander, in his False Heracles, says- 
  Did he not try to wheedle Nanni?n?

And Antiphanes, in his treatise On Courtesans, says- "Nanni?n was nicknamed the Proscenium, because she had a beautiful face, and used to wear very costly garments embroidered with gold, but when she was undressed she was a very bad figure. And Corone was Nanni?n's daughter, and she was nicknamed Tethe, from her exceedingly debauched habits."  Hypereides, in his oration against Patrocles, also speaks of a female flute-player named Nemeas. And we may wonder how it was that the Athenians permitted a courtesan to have such a name, which was that of a most honourable and solemn festival. For not only those who prostituted themselves, but all other slaves also were forbidden to take such names as that, as Polemon tells us, in his treatise on the Acropolis.

[52.] G   The same Hypereides also mentions my Ocim?n, as you call her, O Cynulcus, in his second oration against Aristagora, speaking thus- "As Lais, who appears to have been superior in beauty to any woman who had ever been seen, and Ocim?n, and Metaneira." And Nicostratus, a poet of the middle comedy, mentions her also in his Pandrosus, where he says 
  Then go the same way to Aerope, 
  And bid her send some clothes immediately, 
  And brazen vessels, to fair Ocim?n.

And Menander, in his comedy called The Flatterer, gives the following catalogue of courtesans- 
  Chrysis, Corone, Ischas, and Anticyra, 
  And the most beautiful Nannari?n,- 
  All these you had.

And Philetaerus, in his Female Hunter, says- 
  Is not Cercope now extremely old. 
  Three thousand years at least! and is not Telesis, 
  Diopeithes' ugly daughter, three times that? 
  And as for old Theolyte, no man 
  Alive can tell the date when she was horn. 
  Then did not Lais persevere in her trade 
  Till the last day of her life? and Isthmias, 
  Neaera too, and Phila, grew quite rotten. 
  I need not mention all the Cossyphae, 
  Galenae, and Coronae; nor will I 
  Say aught of Nais, as her teeth are gone.

And Theophilus, in his Amateur of the Flute, says- 
  Lest he should with disastrous shipwreck fall 
  Into Meconis, Lais, or Sisymbri?n 
  Or Barathr?n, or Thallusa, or any other 
  With whom the panders bait their nets for youths, 
  . . . Nanni?n, or Malthace.

[53.] G   [588] Now when Myrtilus had uttered all this with extreme volubility, he added:- May no such disaster befall you, O philosophers, who even before the rise of the sect called Hedonists, yourselves broke down the wall of pleasure, as Eratosthenes somewhere or other expresses it. And indeed I have now quoted enough of the smart sayings of the courtesans, and I will pass on to another topic.  # And first of all, I will speak of that most devoted lover of truth, Epicurus, who, never having been initiated into the encyclic series of learning, used to say that those were well off who applied themselves to philosophy in the same way in which he did himself; and these were his words- "I praise and congratulate you, my young man, because you have come over to the study of philosophy unimbued with any system." On which account Timon styles him- 
  The most unlettered schoolmaster alive.

Now, had not this very Epicurus Leonti?n for his mistress, her, I mean, who was so celebrated as a courtesan? But she did not cease to live as a prostitute when she began to learn philosophy, but still prostituted herself to the whole sect of Epicureans in the gardens, and to Epicurus himself, in the most open manner; so that this great philosopher was exceedingly fond of her, though he mentions this fact in his letters to Hermarchus.

[54.] G   But as for Lais of Hyccara- (and Hyccara is a city in Sicily, from which place she came to Corinth, having been made a prisoner of war, as Polemon relates in the sixth book of his Reply to Timaeus: and Aristippus was one of her lovers, and so was Demosthenes the orator, and Diogenes the Cynic: and it was also said that the Aphrodite, which is at Corinth, and is called Melaenis, appeared to her in a dream, intimating to her by such an appearance that she would be courted by many lovers of great wealth;)- Lais, I say, is mentioned by Hypereides, in the second of his speeches against Aristagora. And Apelles the painter, having seen Lais while she was still a maiden, drawing water at the fountain Peirene, and marvelling at her beauty, took her with him on one occasion to a banquet of his friends.  And when his companions laughed at him because he had brought a maiden with him to the party, instead of a courtesan, he said - "Do not wonder, for I will show you that she is quite beautiful enough for future enjoyment within three years." And a prediction of this sort was made by Socrates also, respecting Theodote the Athenian, as Xenophon tells us in his Memorabilia [ 3.11 ], for he used to say- "That she was very beautiful, and had a bosom finely shaped beyond all description. And let us," said he, "go and see the woman; for people cannot judge of beauty by hearsay."  But Lais was so beautiful, that painters used to come to her to copy her bosom and her breasts. And Lais was a rival of Phryne, and had an immense number of lovers, never caring whether they were rich or poor, and never treating them with any insolence.

[55.] G   And Aristippus every year used to spend whole days with her in Aegina, at the festival of Poseidon. And once, being reproached by his servant, who said to him- "You give her such large sums of money, but she admits Diogenes the Cynic for nothing" he answered, "I give Lais a great deal, that I myself may enjoy her, and not that no one else may."  And when Diogenes said, "Since you, O Aristippus, cohabit with a common prostitute, either, therefore, become a Cynic yourself, as I am, or else abandon her;" Aristippus answered him- "Does it appear to you, O Diogenes, an absurd thing to live in a house where other men have lived before you ?" "Not at all," said he. "Well, then, does it appear to you absurd to sail in a ship in which other men have sailed before you?" "By no means," said he. "Well, then," replied Aristippus, "it is not a bit more absurd to be in love with a woman with whom many men have been in love already."

And Nymphodorus the Syracusan, in his treatise on People who have been admired and eminent in Sicily, [589] says that Lais was a native of Hyccara, which he describes as a strong fortress in Sicily. But Strattis, in his play entitled The Macedonians or Pausanias, says that she was a Corinthian, in the following lines- 
  (A)   Where do these girls come from, and who are they? 
  (B)   At present they are come from Megara, 
  But they by birth are all Corinthians: 
  This one is Lais, who is so well known.

And Timaeus, in the thirteenth book of his History, says she came from Hyccara, (using the word in the plural number;) as Polemon has stated, where he says that she was murdered by some women in Thessaly, because she was beloved by a Thessalian of the name of Pausanias; and that she was beaten to death, out of envy and jealousy, by wooden footstools in the temple of Aphrodite; and that from this circumstance that temple is called the temple of the impious Aphrodite; and that her tomb is shown on the banks of the Peneus, having on it an emblem of a stone water-ewer, and this inscription- 
  This is the tomb of Lais, to whose beauty, 
  Equal to that of heavenly goddesses, 
  The glorious and unconquered Greece did bow; 
  Love was her father, Corinth was her home, 
  Now in the rich Thessalian plain she lies ;- 
so that those men talk nonsense who say that she was buried in Corinth, near the Craneium.

[56.] G   [589] And did not Aristotle of Stageira have a son named Nicomachus by a courtesan named Herpyllis? and did he not live with her till his death? as Hermippus informs us in the first book of his Life of Aristotle, saying that great care was taken of her in the philosopher's will. And did not our admirable Plato love Archaeanassa, a courtesan of Colophon? so that he even composed this song in her honour:- 
  My mistress is the fair Archaeanassa 
  From Colophon, a damsel in whom Love 
  Sits on her very wrinkles irresistible. 
  Wretched are those, whom in the flower of youth, 
  When first she came across the sea, she met; 
  They must have been entirely consumed.

And did not Pericles the Olympian (as Clearchus tells us in the first book of his treatise on Amatory Matters) throw all Greece into confusion on account of Aspasia, not the younger one, but that one who associated with the wise Socrates; and that, too, though he was a man who had acquired such a vast reputation for wisdom and political sagacity? But, indeed, Pericles was always a man much addicted to amorous indulgences; and he cohabited even with his own son's wife, as Stesimbrotus the Thasian informs us; and Stesimbrotus was a contemporary of his, and had seen him, as he tells us in his book entitled A Treatise on Themistocles, and Thucydides, and Pericles. And Antisthenes, the pupil of Socrates, tells us that Pericles, being in love with Aspasia, used to kiss her twice every day, once when he entered her house, and once when he left it. And when she was impeached for impiety, he himself spoke in her behalf, and shed more tears for her sake than he did when his own property and his own life were imperilled. Moreover, when Cimon had had an incestuous affair with Elpinice, his sister, who was afterwards given in marriage to Callias, and when he was banished, Pericles contrived his recall, exacting the favours of Elpinice as his recompense.

And Pythaenetus, in the third book of his History of Aegina, says that Periander fell violently in love with Melissa, the daughter of Procles of Epidaurus, when he had seen her clothed in the Peloponnesian fashion (for she had on no cloak, but a single tunic only, and was acting as cupbearer to the young men,) and he married her.  # And Tigris of Leucadia was the mistress of Pyrrhus king of Epirus, who was the third in descent from the Pyrrhus who invaded Italy; [590] but Olympias, the young man's mother, took her off by poison.

[57.] G   And Ulpianus, as if he had got some unexpected gain, while Myrtilus was still speaking, said:- Do we say ? ?????? in the masculine gender? for I know that Philemon says this in his play called Neaera:- 
  (A)   Just as Seleucus sent the tiger (??? ??????) here, 
  Which we have seen, so we in turn ought now 
  To send Seleucus back a beast from here. 
  (B)   Let's send him a trigeranus; for that's 
  An animal not known much in those parts.

And Myrtilus said to him:- Since you interrupted us when we were making out a catalogue of women, not like the lists of Sosicrates of Phanagoreia, or like the catalogue of women of Nicaenetus of Samos or Abdera (whichever was really his native country), I, digressing a little, will turn to your question, my old Phoenix. Learn, then, that Alexis, in his Fire-Lighter, has said ??? ??????, using the word in the masculine gender; and these are his words: 
  Come, open quick the door; I have been here, 
  Though all unseen, walking sometime,- a statue, 
  A millstone, and a hippopotamus, and a wall, 
  The tiger (? ??????) of Seleucus.

And I might quote other examples of the fact, but I postpone them for the present, while I finish my catalogue, as far as it comprehends the beautiful women.

[58.] G   For Clearchus speaks thus concerning Epaminondas: "Epaminondas the Theban behaved with more dignity than these men did; but still there was a want of dignity in the way in which he was induced to waver in his sentiments in his association with women, as any one will admit who considers his conduct with the Laconian's wife." But Hypereides the orator, having driven his son Glaucippus out of his house, received into it that most extravagant courtesan Myrrhina, and kept her in the city; and he also kept Aristagora in the Peiraeus, and Phila at Eleusis, whom he bought for a very large sum, and then emancipated; and after that he made her his housekeeper, as Idomeneus relates. But, in his oration in defence of Phryne, Hypereides confesses that he is in love with the woman; and yet, before he had got cured of that love, he introduced the above-mentioned Myrrhina into his house.

[59.] G    # Now Phryne was a native of Thespiae; and being prosecuted by Euthias on a capital charge, she was acquitted: on which account Euthias was so indignant that he never instituted any prosecution afterwards, as Hermippus tells us.  But Hypereides, when pleading Phryne's cause, as he did not succeed at all, but it was plain that the judges were about to condemn her, brought her forth into the middle of the court, and, tearing open her tunic and displaying her naked bosom, employed all the end of his speech, with the highest oratorical art, to excite the pity of her judges by the sight of her beauty, and inspired the judges with a superstitious fear, so that they were so moved by pity as not to be able to stand the idea of condemning to death "a prophetess and priestess of Aphrodite." And when she was acquitted, a decree was drawn up in the following form: "That hereafter no orator should endeavour to excite pity on behalf of any one, and that no man or woman, when impeached, shall have his or her case decided on while present."

"Aphodrite of Cnidus" (Vatican)	But Phryne was a really beautiful woman, even in those parts of her person which were not generally seen: on which account it was not easy to see her naked; for she used to wear a tunic which covered her whole person, and she never used the public baths. But on the solemn assembly of the Eleusinian festival, and on the feast of the Poseidonia, then she laid aside her garments in the sight of all the assembled Greeks, and having undone her hair, she went to bathe in the sea; and it was from her that Apelles took his picture of Aphrodite Anadyomene; [591] and Praxiteles the sculptor, who was a lover of hers, modelled the Aphrodite of Cnidus from her body; and on the pedestal of his statue of Eros, which is placed below the stage in the theatre, he wrote the following inscription :- 
  Praxiteles has devoted earnest care 
  To representing all the love he felt, 
  Drawing his model from his inmost heart: 
  I gave myself to Phryne for her wages, 
  And now I no more charms employ, nor arrows, 
  Save those of earnest glances at my love.
And he gave Phryne the choice of his statues, whether she chose to take the Eros, or the Satyr which is in the street called the Tripods; and she, having chosen the Eros, consecrated it in the temple at Thespiae. And the people of her neighbourhood, having had a statue made of Phryne herself, of solid gold, consecrated it in the temple of Delphi, having had it placed on a pillar of Pentelic marble; and the statue was made by Praxiteles.  # And when Crates the Cynic saw it, he called it "a votive offering of the profligacy of Greece." And this statue stood in the middle between that of Archidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians, and that of Philippus the son of Amyntas; and it bore this inscription- "Phryne of Thespiae, the daughter of Epicles," as we are told by Alcetas, in the second book of his treatise On the Offerings at Delphi.

[60.] G   But Apollodorus, in his book on Courtesans, says that there were two women named Phryne, one of whom was nick-named Clausigelos ["Weep-laughter"], and the other Saperdi?n ["Goldfish"]. But Herodicus, in the sixth book of his Essay on People mentioned by the Comic Poets, says that the one who is mentioned by the orators was called Sestos, because she sifted (?????????) and stripped bare all her lovers;- and that the other was the native of Thespiae.  But Phryne was exceedingly rich, and she offered to build a wall round Thebes, if the Thebans would inscribe on the wall, "Alexander destroyed this wall, but Phryne the courtesan restored it;" as Callistratus states in his treatise on Courtesans. And Timocles the comic poet, in his Neaera, has mentioned her riches (the passage has been already cited [ 567'e ]); and so has Amphis, in his Curis. And Gryllion was a parasite of Phryne's, though he was one of the judges of the Areopagus; as also Satyrus, the Olynthian actor, was a parasite of Pamphila. But Aristogeiton, in his book against Phryne, says that her proper name was Mnesarete; and I am aware that Diodorus Periegetes says that the oration against her which is ascribed to Euthias, is really the work of Anaximenes. But Poseidippus the comic poet, in his Ephesian Women, speaks in the following manner concerning her 
  Before our time, the Thespian Phryne was 
  Far the most famous of all courtesans; 
  And even though you're later than her age, 
  Still you have heard of the trial which she stood. 
  She was accused on a capital charge 
  Before the Heliaea, being said 
  To have corrupted all the citizens; 
  But she besought the judges separately 
  With tears, and so just saved herself from judgment.

[61.] G   And I would have you all to know that Demades, the orator, became the father of Demeas, by a female flute-player who was a courtesan; and once when Demeas was giving himself airs on the speaker's platform, Hypereides stopped his mouth, saying, "Will not you be silent, young man? why, you make more puffing than your mother did." And also Bion of the Borysthenes, the philosopher, was the son of a Lacedaemonian courtesan named Olympia; [592] as Nicias the Nicaean informs us in his treatise called The Successions of the Philosophers. And Sophocles the tragic poet, when he was an old man, was a lover of Theoris the courtesan; and accordingly, calling on the favour and assistance of Aphrodite, he says- 
  Hear me now praying, goddess, nurse of youths, 
  And grant that this my love may scorn young men, 
  And their most feeble fancies and embraces; 
  And rather cling to grey-headed old men, 
  Whose minds are vigorous, though their limbs be weak.

And these verses are some of those which are at times attributed to Homer. But he mentions Theoris by name, speaking thus in one of his plain choruses 
  For dear to me Theoris is.

And towards the end of his life, as Hegesander says, he was a lover of the courtesan Archippe, and he left her the heiress of all his property; but as Archippe cohabited with Sophocles, though he was very old, Smicrines, her former lover, being asked by some one what Archippe was doing, said very wittily, "Why, like the owls, she is sitting on the tombs."

[62.] G   But Isocrates also, the most modest of all the orators, had a mistress named Metaneira, who was very beautiful, as Lysias relates in his Letters. But Demosthenes, in his oration against Neaera, says that Metaneira was the mistress of Lysias. And Lysias also was desperately in love with Lagis the courtesan, whose panegyric Cephalus the orator wrote, just as Alcidamas the Elean, the pupil of Gorgias, himself wrote a panegyric on the courtesan Nais. And, in his oration against Philonides, who was under prosecution for an assault, (if, at least, the oration be a genuine one,) Lysias says that Nais was the mistress of Philonides, writing as follows:- "There is then a woman who is a courtesan, Nais by name, whose keeper is Archias; but your friend Philonides states himself to be in love with her." Aristophanes also mentions her in his Gerytades, and perhaps also in his Plutus [ 179 ], where he says- 
  Is it not owing to you the greedy Lais 
  Does love Philonides?

For perhaps here we ought to read Nais, and not Lais. But Hermippus, in his Essay on Isocrates, says that Isocrates, when he was advancing in years, took the courtesan Lagisca to his house, and had a daughter by her. And Strattis speaks of her in these lines: 
  And while she still was in her bed, I saw 
  Isocrates' concubine, Lagisca, 
  Playing her tricks; and with her the flute-maker.

And Lysias, in his speech against Lais, (if, at least, the oration be a genuine one,) mentions her, giving a list of other courtesans also, in the following words:- "Philyra indeed abandoned the trade of a courtesan while she was still young; and Scione, and Hippaphesis, and Theocleia, and Psamathe, and Lagisca, and Antheia, and Aristocleia, all abandoned it also at an early age."

[63.] G   But it is reported that Demosthenes the orator had children by a courtesan; at all events he himself, in his speech About the Gold, introduced his children before the court, in order to obtain pity by their means, without their mother; although it was customary to bring forward the wives of those who were on their trial; however, he did this for shame's sake, hoping to avoid calumny. But this orator was exceedingly addicted to amorous indulgences, as Idomeneus tells us. Accordingly, being in love with a youth named Aristarchus, he once, when he was intoxicated, insulted Nicodemus on his account, and struck out his eyes. He is related also to have been very extravagant in his table, and his followers, and in women. Therefore, his secretary once said, [593] "But what can any one say of Demosthenes? For everything that he has thought of for a whole year, is all thrown into confusion by one woman in one night." Accordingly, he is said to have received into his house a youth named Cnosion, although he had a wife; and she, being indignant at this, went herself and slept with Cnosion.

[64.] G   And Demetrius the king, the last of all Alexander's successors, had a mistress named Myrrhina, a Samian courtesan; and in every respect but the crown, he made her his partner in the kingdom, as Nicolaus of Damascus tells us.  # And Ptolemaeus the son of Ptolemy Philadelphus the king, who was governor of the garrison in Ephesus, had a mistress named Eirene. And she, when plots were laid against Ptolemaeus by the Thracians at Ephesus, and when he fled to the temple of Artemis, fled with him: and when the conspirators had murdered him, Eirene seizing hold of the bars of the doors of the temple, sprinkled the altar with his blood till they slew her also.  # And Sophron the governor of Ephesus had a mistress, Danae, the daughter of Leonti?n the Epicurean was also a courtesan herself. And by her means he was saved when a plot was laid against him by Laodice, and Laodice was thrown down a precipice, as Phylarchus relates in his twelfth book [ Fr_24 ] in these words: "Danae was a chosen companion of Laodice, and was trusted by her with all her secrets; and, being the daughter of that Leonti?n who had studied with Epicurus the natural philosopher, and having been herself formerly the mistress of Sophron, she, perceiving that Laodice was laying a plot to murder Sophron, revealed the plot to Sophron by a sign. And he, understanding the sign, and pretending to agree to what Laodice was saying to him, asked two days to deliberate on what he should do. And, when she had agreed to that, he fled away by night to Ephesus. But Laodice, when she learnt what had been done by Danae, threw her down a precipice, discarding all recollection of their former friendship. And they say that Danae, when she perceived the danger which was impending over her, was interrogated by Laodice, and refused to give her any answer; but, when she was dragged to the precipice, then she said, that 'many people justly despise the Deity, and they may justify themselves by my case, who having saved a man who was to me as my husband, am requited in this manner by the Deity. But Laodice, who murdered her husband, is thought worthy of such honour.' "

 # The same Phylarchus also speaks of Mysta, in his fourteenth book [ Fr_30 ], in these terms: "Mysta was the mistress of Seleucus the king, and when Seleucus was defeated by the Galatians, and was with difficulty able to save himself by flight, she put off the robes of a queen which she had been accustomed to wear, and assumed the garment of an ordinary servant; and being taken prisoner, was carried away with the rest of the captives. And being sold in the same manner as her handmaidens, she came to Rhodes; and there, when she had revealed who she was, she was sent back with great honour to Seleucus by the Rhodians."

[65.] G    # But Demetrius Phalereus being in love with Lampito, a courtesan of Samos was pleased when he himself was addressed as Lampito, as Diyllus tells us; and he was also called Charitoblepharos ["Pretty Eyes"]. And Nicarete the courtesan was the mistress of Stephanus the orator; and Metaneira was the mistress of Lysias the sophist; and these women were the slaves of Casius the Elean, with many other such, as Anteia, Stratola, Aristocleia, Phila, Isthmias, and Neaera. But Neaera was the mistress of Xenocleides the poet, and of Hipparchus the actor, and of Phrynion of Paeania, who was the son of Demon and the nephew of Demochares. And Phrynion and Stephanus the orator used to have Neaera in turn, each a day, since their friends had so arbitrated the matter for them; [594] and the daughter of Neaera, whose name was Strymbele, and who was afterwards called Phano, Stephanus gave (as if she had been his own daughter) in marriage to Phrastor of Aegilia; as Demosthenes tells us in his oration against Neaera [ 59'50 ]. And he also speaks in the following manner about Sinope the courtesan [ 59'116 ]: "And you punished Archias the hierophant, when he was convicted before the regular tribunals of behaving with impiety, and offering sacrifices which were contrary to the laws of the nation. And he was accused also of other things, and among them of having sacrificed a victim on the festival of Haloa, which was offered by Sinope the courtesan, on the altar which is in the court of the temple at Eleusis, though it is against the law to sacrifice any victims on that day; and though, too, it was no part of his duty to sacrifice at all, but it belonged to the priestess to do so."

[66.] G   Plang?n the Milesian was also a celebrated courtesan; and she, as she was most wonderfully beautiful, was beloved by a young man of Colophon, who already had Bacchis of Samos as his mistress. Accordingly, when this young man began to address his solicitations to Plang?n, she, having heard of the beauty of Bacchis, wished to make the young man abandon his love for her. When she was unable to effect that, she required as the price of her favours the necklace of Bacchis, which was very celebrated.  And he, as he was exceedingly in love, entreated Bacchis not to see him totally overwhelmed with despair; and Bacchis, seeing the excited state of the young man, gave him the necklace. And Plang?n, when she saw the freedom from jealousy which was exhibited by Bacchis, sent her back the necklace, but kept the young man: and ever after Plang?n and Bacchis were friends, loving the young man in common; and the Ionians being amazed at this, as Menetor tells us in his treatise On Votive Offerings, gave Plang?n the name of Pasiphila ["Dear to all"]. And Archilochus mentions her in the following lines 
  As a fig-tree planted on a lofty rock 
  Feeds many crows and jackdaws, so Pasiphila's 
  A willing entertainer of all strangers.

That Menander the poet was a lover of Glycera, is well known by everybody; but still he was not well pleased with her. For when Philemon was in love with a courtesan, and in one of his plays called her "excellent," Menander, in one of his plays, said, in contradiction to this, that there was no courtesan who was good.

[67.] G   And Harpalus the Macedonian, who robbed Alexander of vast sums of money and then fled to Athens, being in love with Pythionice, spent an immense deal of money on her; and she was a courtesan. And when she died he erected a monument to her which cost him many talents. And as he was carrying her out to burial, as Poseidonius tells us in the twenty-second book of his History [ Fr_14 ], he had the body accompanied with a band of the most eminent artists of all kinds, and with all sorts of musical instruments and songs. And Dicaearchus, in his Essay on the Descent to the Cave of Trophonius, says,- "And that same sort of thing may happen to any one who goes to the city of the Athenians, and who proceeds by the road leading from Eleusis, which is called the Sacred Road; for, if he stops at that point from which he first gets a sight of Athens, and of the temple, and of the citadel, he will see a tomb built by the wayside, of such a size that there is none other near which can be compared with it for magnitude. And at first, as would be natural, he would pronounce it to be the tomb, beyond all question, of Miltiades, or Cimon, or Pericles, or of some other of the great men of Athens. [595] And above all, he would feel sure that it had been erected by the city at the public expense, or at all events by some public decree; and then, again, when he heard it was the tomb of Pythionice the courtesan, what must be his feelings?"

And Theopompus also, in his Letter to Alexander, speaking reproachfully of the profligacy of Harpalus, says,- "But just consider and listen to the truth, as you may hear from the people of Babylon, as to the manner in which he treated Pythionice when she was dead; who was originally the slave of Bacchis, the female flute-player. And Bacchis herself had been the slave of Sinope the Thracian, who brought her establishment of harlots from Aegina to Athens; so that she was not only trebly a slave, but also trebly a harlot. He, however, erected two monuments to her at an expense exceeding two hundred talents. And every one marvelled that no one of all those who died in Cilicia, in defence of your dominions and of the freedom of the Greeks, had had any tomb adorned for them either by him or by any other of the governors of the state; but that a tomb should be erected to Pythionice the courtesan, both in Athens and in Babylon; and they have now stood a long time.  For a man who ventured to call himself a friend to you, has dared to consecrate a temple and a spot of ground to a woman whom everybody knew to have been common to every one who chose at the same fixed price, and to call both the temple and the altar those of Aphrodite Pythionice; and in so doing, he despised also the vengeance of the Gods, and endeavoured to insult the honours to which you are entitled." Philemon also mentions these circumstances, in his comedy called The Babylonian, where he says- 
  You shall be queen of Babylon if the Fates 
  Will but permit it. Sure you recollect 
  Pythionice and proud Harpalus.

Alexis also mentions her in his Lyciscus.

[68.] G   But after the death of Pythionice, Harpalus sent for Glycera, and she also was a courtesan, as Theopompus relates, when he says that Harpalus issued an edict that no one should present him with a crown, without at the same time paying a similar compliment to his prostitute; and adds,- "He has also erected a brazen statue to Glycera in Rhossus of Syria, where he intends to erect one of you, and another of himself. And he has permitted her to dwell in the palace in Tarsus, and he permits her to receive adoration from the people, and to bear the title of Queen, and to be complimented with other presents, which are only fit for your own mother and your own wife." And we have a testimony coinciding with this from the author of the satyric drama called Agen, which was exhibited, on the occasion when the Dionysian festival was celebrated on the banks of the river Hydaspes, by the author, whether he was Pythen of Catana or Byzantium, or the king himself. And it was exhibited when Harpalus had fled to the sea-shore, after he had revolted; and it mentions Pythionice as already dead; and Glycera, as being with Harpalus, and as being the person who encouraged the Athenians to receive presents from Harpalus. And the verses of the play are as follows:- 
  (A)   There is a pinnacle, where never birds 
  Have made their nests, where the long reeds do grow; 
  And on the left is the illustrious temple 
  Raised to a courtesan, which Pallides 
  Erected, but repenting of the deed, 
  Condemned himself for it to banishment. 
  And when some magi of the barbarians 
  Saw him oppressed with the stings of conscience, 
  They made him trust that they could raise again 
  [596] The soul of Pythionice.

And the author of the play calls Harpalus Pallides in this passage; but in what follows, he speaks of him by his real name, saying- 
  (B)   But I do wish to learn from you, since I 
  Dwell a long way from thence, what is the fate 
  At present of the land of Athens; and 
  How all its people fare ! 
  (A)   Why, when they said 
  That they were slaves, they plenty had to eat, 
  But now they have raw vegetables only, 
  And fennel, and but little corn or meat. 
  (B)   I likewise hear that Harpalus has sent them 
  A quantity of corn no less than Agen, 
  And has been made a citizen of Athens. 
  (A)   That corn was Glycera's. But it is perhaps 
  To them a pledge of ruin, not of a courtesan.

[69.] G   Naucratis also has produced some very celebrated courtesans of exceeding beauty: for instance, Doricha, who became the mistress of Charaxus, the brother of the lovely Sappho, when he went to Naucratis on some mercantile business.  Sappho accuses Doricha in her poetry of having stripped Charaxus of a great deal of his property. But Herodotus calls her Rhodopis, being evidently ignorant that Rhodopis and Doricha were two different people; and it was Rhodopis who dedicated those celebrated spits at Delphi, which Cratinus mentions in the following lines- 
  . . . . . [ the quotation is missing ]

Poseidippus also made this epigram on Doricha, although he had often mentioned her in his Aesopia, and this is the epigram- 
  Here, Doricha, your bones have long been laid, 
  Here is your hair, and your well-scented robe: 
  You who once loved the elegant Charaxus, 
  And quaffed with him the morning bowl of wine. 
  But Sappho's pages live, and still shall live, 
  In which is many a mention of your name, 
  Which still your native Naucratis shall cherish 
  As long as any ship sails down the Nile.

Archedice also was a native of Naucratis; and she was a courtesan of great beauty. "For some how or other," as Herodotus says [ 2.135 ], "Naucratis is in the habit of producing beautiful courtesans."

[70.] G   There was also a certain courtesan named Sappho, a native of Eresus, who was in love with the beautiful Phaon, and she was very celebrated, as Nymphis relates in his Voyage round Asia. But Nicarete of Megara, who was a courtesan, was not a woman of ignoble birth, but she was born of free parents, and was very well calculated to excite affection by reason of her accomplishments, and she was a pupil of Stilpon the philosopher.

There was also Bilistiche the Argive, who was a very celebrated courtesan, and who traced her descent back to the Atreidae, as those historians relate who have written the history of the affairs of Argolis. There was also a courtesan named Leaena, whose name is very celebrated, and she was the mistress of Harmodius, who slew the tyrant. And she, being tortured by command of Hippias the tyrant, died under the torture without having said a word. Stratocles the orator also had for his mistress a courtesan whose name was Leme, and who was nicknamed Parorama, because she used to let whoever chose come to her for two drachmas, as Gorgias says in his treatise on Courtesans.

Now though Myrtilus appeared to be intending to say no more after this, he resumed his subject, and said:- But I was nearly forgetting, my friends, to tell you of the Lyde of Antimachus, [597] and also of her namesake Lyde, who was also a courtesan and the mistress of Lamynthius the Milesian. For each of these poets, as Clearchus tells us in his Tales of Love, being inflamed with love for the barbarian Lyde, wrote poems, the one in elegiac, and the other in lyric verse, and they both entitled their poems Lyde. I omitted also to mention the female flute-player Nanno, the mistress of Mimnermus, and Leonti?n, the mistress of Hermesianax of Colophon. For he inscribed with her name, as she was his mistress, three books of elegiac poetry, in the third of which he gives a catalogue of love affairs; speaking in the following manner:-

[71.] G   "Such was she whom the dear son of Oeagrus, [Orpheus] armed only with the lyre, brought back from Hades, even the Thracian Agriope. Aye, he sailed to that evil and inexorable place where Charon drags into the common barque the souls of the departed; and over the lake he shouts afar, as it pours its flood from out the tall reeds. Yet Orpheus, though girded for the journey all alone, dared to sound his lyre beside the wave, and he won over gods of every shape; even the lawless Cocytus he saw, raging beneath his banks; and he flinched not before the gaze of the Hound [Cerberus] most dread, his voice baying forth angry fire, with fire his cruel eye gleaming, an eye that on triple heads bore terror. Whence, by his song, Orpheus persuaded the mighty lords that Agriope should recover the gentle breath of life.

"Nor did the son of Mene, Musaeus, master of the Graces, cause Antiope to go without her due of honour. And she, beside Eleusis's strand, expounded to the initiates the loud, sacred voice of mystic oracles, as she duly escorted the priest through the Rarian plain to honour Demeter. And she is known even in Hades.

"I say, too, that Boeotian Hesiod, master of all lore, left his hall and went to the Heliconian village of the Ascraeans, because he was in love; whence, in wooing Eoe?, maid of Ascra, he suffered many pangs; and as he sang, he wrote all the scrolls of his Catalogues, ever proceeding from a girl's name first [? ???, "Or such as her"].

"But that bard himself, whom the decree of Zeus for ever ordains to be the sweetest divinity among all poets, godlike Homer, languished to thinness, and set Ithaca in the strains of song for love of wise Penelope; for her sake he went, with many sufferings, to that small isle, far from his own wide country; and he celebrated the kin of Icarius, the folk of Amyclas, and Sparta too, ever mindful of his own misfortunes.

"And Mimnermus, who discovered, after much suffering, [598] the sweet sound and spirit breathed from the languorous pentameter, burned for Nanno; yet oft upon his venerable flute, bound to his lips, he with Hexamyles would hold revel. But he quarrelled with Hermobius, the ever cruel, and Pherecles, too, his foe, whom he loathed for the taunts which he hurled against him.

"Antimachus, too, smitten with love for the Lydian girl Lyde, trod the ground where the Pactolus river flows; and when she died, in his helplessness he placed her in the hard earth, weeping the while, and in his woe he left her there and returned to lofty Colophon; then he filled his pious scrolls with plaints, and rested after all his pain.

"As for the Lesbian Alcaeus, you know in how many revels he engaged, when he smote his lyre with yearning love for Sappho. And the bard who loved that nightingale caused sorrow, by the eloquence of his hymns, to the Teian poet. Yea, for the honey-voiced Anacreon contended for her [Sappho], whose beauty was supreme among the many women of Lesbos. And at times he would leave Samos, at times again his own city, that nestles against the vine-covered hill, and visit Lesbos, rich in wine; and oft he gazed upon Lectum, the Mysian headland across the Aeolian wave.

"How, too, the Attic bee [Sophocles] left Colone of the many hillocks, and sang with choruses marshalled in tragedy - sang of Bacchus and of his passion for Theoris and for Erigone, whom Zeus once gave to Sophocles in his old age.

"I say, too, that that man [Euripides] who had ever guarded himself against passion, and had won the hatred of all men by his railings concerning all women, was none the less smitten by the treacherous bow, and could not lay aside his pangs by night; nay, in Macedonia he traversed all the by-ways in his woe, and became dependant on the steward of Archelaus; until at last Fate found destruction for Euripides, when he met the cruel hounds from Arribius.

"And that poet from Cythera, whom the nurses of Bacchus reared, and the Muses taught to be the most faithful steward of the flute, Philoxenus, - you know how he was racked with pain, and passed through our city to Ortygia; for you have heard of his mighty yearning, which Galateia esteemed less than the very firstlings of the flock.

"You know also of that bard in whose honour the townsmen of Eurypylus, the men of Cos, raised a bronze statue beneath the plane-tree; he, Philitas, sang his love for the nimble Bittis, versed as he was in all the terms of love and in all its speech.

"Yea, not even all the mortals who ordained for themselves a life austere, seeking to find the dark things of wisdom, those men whom their very craft caused to choke in the shrewd contests of debate, and their dread skill, which bestowed its care upon eloquence, - not even they could turn aside the awful, maddened turmoil of Eros, [599] but they fell beneath the power of that dread charioteer.

"Such was the madness for Theano that bound with its spell the Samian Pythagoras; yet he had discovered the refinements of geometric spirals, and had modelled in a small globe the mighty circuit of the enveloping aether.

"And with what fiery power did Cypris, in her wrath, heat Socrates, whom Apollo had declared to be supreme among all men in wisdom! Yea, though his soul was deep, yet he laboured with lighter pains when he visited the house of Aspasia; nor could he find any remedy, though he had discovered the many cross-paths of logic.

"Even the man of Cyrene, keen Aristippus, was drawn by overpowering love beyond the Isthmus, when he fell in love with Lais of Apidane; in his flight he renounced all discourse, and expounded a life of worthlessness."

[72.] G   But in this Hermesianax is mistaken when he represents Sappho and Anacreon as contemporaries. For the one lived in the time of Cyrus and Polycrates; but Sappho lived in the reign of Alyattes, the father of Croesus. But Chamaeleon, in his treatise on Sappho, does assert that some people say that these verses were made upon her by Anacreon:- 
  Eros, the golden-haired god, 
  Struck me with his purple ball, 
  And with his many wiles doth seize 
  And challenge me to sport with him. 
  But she- and she from Lesbos comes, 
  That populous and wealthy isle- 
  Laughs at my hair and calls it grey, 
  And will prefer a younger lover.

And he says, too, that Sappho says this to him:- 
  You, O my golden-throned Muse, 
  Did surely dictate that sweet hymn, 
  Which the noble Teian bard, 
  From the fair and fertile isle, 
  Chief muse of lovely womanhood, 
  Sang with his dulcet voice.

But it is plain enough in reality that this piece of poetry is not Sappho's. And I think myself that Hermesianax is joking concerning the love of Anacreon and Sappho. For Diphilus the comic poet, in his play called Sappho, has represented Archilochus and Hipponax as the lovers of Sappho.

Now it appears to me, my friends, that I have displayed some diligence in getting up this amorous catalogue for you, as I myself am not a person so mad about love as Cynulcus, with his calumnious spirit, has represented me. I confess, indeed, that I am amorous, but I do deny that I am frantic on the subject. 
  And why should I dilate upon my sorrows, 
  When I may hide them all in night and silence? 
as Aeschylus the Alexandrian has said in his Amphitryon. And this is the same Aeschylus who composed the Messenian epic - a man of great learning.

[73.] G   [599] Therefore, considering that Eros is a mighty and most powerful deity, and that the golden Aphrodite is so too, I recollect the verses of Euripides on the subject, and say:- 
  Do you not see how great a deity is 
  This Aphrodite? No tongue can tell, 
  No calculation can arrive at all 
  Her power, or her dominions' vast extent; 
  She nourishes you and me and all mankind, 
  And I can prove this, not in words alone, 
  [600] But facts will show the might of this fair goddess. 
  The earth loves rain when the parched plains are dry, 
  And lose their glad fertility of yield 
  From want of moisture. Then the ample heaven, 
  Filled with rain, and moved by Aphrodite's power, 
  Loves to descend to anxious earth's embrace; 
  Then when these two are joined in tender love 
  They are the parents of all fruits to us, 
  They bring them forth, they cherish them; and so 
  The race of man both lives and flourishes.

And that most magnificent poet Aeschylus, in his Danaides, introduces Aphrodite herself speaking thus- 
  Then, too, the earth feels love, and longs for wedlock, 
  And rain, descending from the amorous air, 
  Impregnates his desiring mate; and she 
  Brings forth delicious food for mortal man,- 
  Herds of fat sheep, and corn, Demeter's gift; 
  The trees love moisture, too, and rain descends 
  To indulge their longings, I alone the cause.

[74.] G   And again, in the Hippolytus of Euripides [ 3 ], Aphrodite says:- 
   And all who dwell between the Euxine sea 
  And the Atlantic waves, all who behold 
  The beams of the rising and the setting sun, 
  Know that I favour those who honour me, 
  And crush all those who boast against me.

And, therefore, in the case of a young man [Hippolytus] who had every other imaginable virtue, this one fault alone, that he did not honour Aphrodite, was the cause of his destruction. And neither Artemis, who loved him exceedingly, nor any other of the gods or demi-gods could defend him; and accordingly, in the words of the same poet [Euripides]:- 
  Whoever denies that Eros is the only god, 
  Is foolish, ignorant of all that's true, 
  And knows not him who is the greatest deity 
  Acknowledged by all nations.

And the wise Anacreon, who is in everybody's mouth, is always celebrating [Eros]. And, accordingly, the admirable Critias also speaks of him in the following manner:- 
  Teos brought forth, a source of pride to Greece, 
  The sweet Anacreon, who with sweet notes twined 
  A wreath of tuneful song in woman's praise, 
  The choicest ornament of revelling feasts, 
  The most seductive charm; the foe of the flute, 
  But lover of the softly moving lyre: 
  O Teian bard, your fame shall never die; 
  Age shall not touch it; while the willing slave 
  Mingles the wine and water in the bowl, 
  And fills the welcome goblet for the guests; 
  While female bands, with many twinkling feet, 
  Lead their glad nightly dance; while many drops, 
  Daughters of these glad cups, the Bromian juice, 
  Fall with good omen on the cottabus dish.

[75.] G   But Archytas, who wrote on the theory of music, says - according to Chamaeleon - that Alcman was the original poet of amatory songs, and that he was the first poet to introduce melodies inciting to erotic indulgence, being {by nature eager to pursue} women. On which account he says in one of his odes:- 
  But Eros again, as Aphrodite wills, 
  Descends into my heart, 
  And with his gentle dew refreshes me.

He says also that Alcman was immoderately in love with Megalostrate, who was a poetess, and who was able to allure lovers to her by the charms of her conversation. [601] And he speaks thus concerning her:- 
  This gift, by the sweet Muse inspired, 
  That lovely damsel gave, 
  The golden-haired Megalostrate.

And Stesichorus, who was in no moderate degree given to amorous pursuits, composed many poems of this kind; which in ancient times were called paideia and paidika. And, in fact, there was such emulation about composing poems of this sort, and so far was any one from thinking lightly of the amatory poets, that Aeschylus, who was a very great poet, and Sophocles, too, introduced the subject of the love [between men] on the stage in their tragedies: the one describing the love of Achilles for Patroclus, and the other, in his Niobe, the mutual love of Niobe's sons (on which account some men have called that tragedy "paederastria"): and all such passages as those are very agreeable to the audiences.

[76.] G   And Ibycus of Rhegium, also, cries out as follows:- 
  In early spring the gold Cydonian apples, 
  Watered by streams from ever-flowing rivers, 
  Where the pure garden of the Virgins is, 
  And the young grapes, growing beneath the shade 
  Of ample branches, flourish and increase: 
  But Eros, who never rests, gives me no shade, 
  Nor any recruiting dew; but like the north wind 
  Fierce rushing down from Thrace, with rapid fire, 
  Urged on by Cypris, with maddening drought 
  He burns up my heart, and from my earliest youth, 
  Rules over my soul with fierce dominion.

And Pindarus, who was of an exceedingly amorous disposition, says:- 
  Oh may it ever be to me to love, 
  And to indulge my love, remote from fear; 
  And do not, my mind, pursue a chase 
  Beyond the present number of your years.

On which account Timon, in his Silli, says:- 
  There is a time to love, a time to wed, 
  A time to leave off loving; 
and adds that it is not well to wait until some one else shall say, in the words of this same philosopher- 
  When this man ought to decline (??????) he now begins 
  To follow pleasure (?????????).

Pindarus also mentions Theoxenus of Tenedos, who was much beloved by him; and what does he say about him?- 
  And now (for seasonable is the time) 
  You ought, my soul, to pluck the flowers of love, 
  Which suit your age. 
  And he who, looking on the brilliant light that beams 
  From the sweet countenance of Theoxenus 
  Is not subdued by love, 
  Must have a dark discoloured heart, 
  Of adamant or iron made, 
  And hardened long in the smith's glowing furnace. 
  That man is scorned by bright-eyed Aphrodite. 
  Or else he's poor, and care doth fill his breast; 
  Or else beneath some female insolence 
  He withers, and so drags on an anxious life: 
  But I, like comb of wily bees, 
  Melt under Aphrodite's heat, 
  And waste away while I behold 
  The budding graces of the youth I love. 
  Surely at Tenedos, persuasion soft, 
  And every grace, abides 
  In the lovely son of Hagesilas.

[77.] G   And many men used to be as fond of having boys as their favourites as women for their mistresses. And this was a frequent fashion in many very well regulated cities of Greece. Accordingly, the Cretans, as I have said before, and the Chalcidians in Euboea, were very much addicted to the custom of having boy-favourites. Therefore Echemenes, in his history of Crete, says that it was not Zeus who carried off Ganymedes, but Minos. But the before-mentioned Chalcidians say that Ganymedes was carried off from them by Zeus; and they show the spot, which they call Harpagium; and it is a place which produces extraordinary myrtles. And Minos abandoned his enmity to the Athenians, although it had originated in consequence of the death of his son, out of his love for Theseus; and he gave his daughter Phaedra to Theseus for his wife, as Zenis (or Zeneus) of Chios, tells us in his History of his Native Land.

[78.] G   [602] But Hieronymus the Peripatetic says that the ancients were anxious to encourage the practice of having boy-favourites, because the vigorous disposition of youths, and the confidence engendered by their association with each other, has often led to the overthrow of tyrants. For in the presence of his favourite, a man would choose to do anything rather than to get the reputation of being a coward. And this was proved in practice in the case of the Sacred Band, as it was called, which was established at Thebes by Epaminondas. Harmodius and Aristogeiton made a deadly attack on the Peisistratidae; and at Acragas in Sicily, the mutual love of Chariton and Melanippus produced a similar result, as we are told by Heracleides of Pontus, in his treatise On Amatory Matters. For when Melanippus and Chariton were informed against as plotting against Phalaris, and were tortured in order to compel them to reveal their accomplices, not only did they not betray them, but they even made Phalaris himself pity them, because of the tortures which they had undergone; so that he dismissed them with great praise. On which account Apollo, being pleased at this conduct, gave Phalaris a respite from death; declaring this to the men who consulted the Pythian priestess as to how they might best attack him. He also gave them an oracle respecting Chariton, putting the pentameter before the hexameter, in the same way as afterwards Dionysius the Athenian did, who was nicknamed the Brazen, in his Elegies; and the oracle runs as follows- 
  Happy were Chariton and Melanippus, 
  Guides in heavenly love to many men.

The circumstances, too, that happened to Cratinus the Athenian, are well known. For he, being a very beautiful boy, at the time when Epimenides was purifying Attica by human sacrifices, on account of some old pollution, as Neanthes of Cyzicus relates in the second book of his treatise On Initiation Rites, willingly gave himself up to secure the safety of the woman who had brought him up. And after his death, Apollodorus, his friend, also devoted himself to death, and so the calamities of the country were terminated. And owing to love affairs of this kind, the tyrants (for friendships of this sort were very adverse to their interests) altogether forbade the fashion of making favourites of boys, and wholly abolished it. And some of them even burnt down and rased to the ground the palaestrae, considering them as fortresses hostile to their own citadels; as, for instance, Polycrates the tyrant of Samos did.

[79.] G   But among the Spartans, as Hagnon the Academic philosopher tells us, unmarried girls are treated like boy-favourites. The great lawgiver Solon has said- 
  Admiring pretty legs and rosy lips;- 
and Aeschylus and Sophocles have openly made similar statements; the one saying, in the Myrmidons- 
  You paid not due respect to modesty, 
  Led by your passion for too frequent kisses;- 
and the other, in his Colchian Women, speaking of Ganymedes, says- 
  Inflaming with his beauty mighty Zeus.

I am not ignorant that the story which is told about Cratinus and Aristodemus is stated by Polemon Periegetes, in his Replies to Neanthes, to be a mere invention. But you, O Cynulcus, believe that all these stories are true, let them be ever so false. And you take the greatest pleasure in all such poems which speak of boys and favourites of that kind . . . The fashion of making favourites of boys was first introduced among the Greeks from Crete, as Timaeus informs us. But others say that Laius was the originator of this custom, when he was received in hospitality by Pelops; and that he took a great fancy to Pelops' son, Chrysippus, whom he put into his chariot and carried off, [603] and fled with to Thebes. But Praxilla the Sicyonian says that Chrysippus was carried off by Zeus. And the Celts, too, although they have the most beautiful women of all the barbarians, still make great favourites of boys; so that some of them often go to rest with two lovers on their beds of hide. And the Persians, according to the statement of Herodotus, learnt from the Greeks to adopt this fashion.

[80.] G   Alexander the king was also very much in the habit of giving in to this fashion. Accordingly, Dicaearchus, in his treatise On the Sacrifice at Troy, says that he was so much under the influence of Bagoas the eunuch, that he embraced him in the sight of the whole theatre; and that when the whole theatre shouted in approval of the action, he repeated it. And Carystius, in his Historical Commentaries, says,- "Charon of Chalcis had a boy of great beauty, who was a great favourite of his: but when Alexander, on one occasion, at a great entertainment given by Craterus, praised this boy very much, Charon bade the boy go and salute Alexander: and he said, 'Not so, for he will not please me so much as he will vex you.' For though the king was of a very amorous disposition, still he was at all times sufficiently master of himself to have a due regard to decorum, and to the preservation of appearances. And in the same spirit, when he had taken as prisoners the daughters of Dareius, and his wife, who was of extraordinary beauty, he not only abstained from offering them any insult, but he took care never to let them feel that they were prisoners at all; but ordered them to be treated in every respect, and to be supplied with everything, just as if Dareius had still been in his palace; on which account, Dareius, when he heard of this conduct, raised his hands to the Sun and prayed that either he might be king, or Alexander."

But Ibycus states that Talus was a great favourite of Rhadamanthys the Just. And Diotimus, in his Heracleia, says that Eurystheus was a great favourite of Heracles, on which account he willingly endured all his labours for his sake. And it is said that Argynnus was a favourite of Agamemnon; and that they first became acquainted from Agamemnon seeing Argynnus bathing in the Cephisus. And afterwards, when he was drowned in this river, (for he was continually bathing in it,) Agamemnon buried him, and raised a temple on the spot to Aphrodite Argynnis. But Licymnius of Chios, in his Dithyrambics, says that it was Hymenaeus of whom Argynnus was a favourite. And Aristocles the harp-player was a favourite of King Antigonus: and Antigonus of Carystus, in his Life of Zenon, writes of him in the following terms: "Antigonus the king used often to go to sup with Zenon; and once, as he was returning by daylight from some entertainment, he went to Zenon's house, and persuaded him to go with him to sup with Aristocles the harp-player, who was an excessive favourite of the king's."

[81.] G   Sophocles, too, had a great fancy for having boy-favourites, equal to the addiction of Euripides for women. And accordingly, Ion the poet, in his book on the Arrival of Illustrious Men in the Island of Chios, writes thus:- "I met Sophocles the poet in Chios, when he was sailing to Lesbos as the general: he was a man very pleasant over his wine, and very witty. And when Hermesilaus, who was connected with him by ancient ties of hospitality, and who was also the proxenus of the Athenians, entertained him, the boy who was mixing the wine was standing by the fire, being a boy of a very beautiful complexion, but made red by the fire: so Sophocles called him and said, 'Do you wish me to drink with pleasure?' and when he said that he did, he said, 'Well, then, bring me the cup, and take it away again in a leisurely manner.' And as the boy blushed all the more at this, Sophocles said to the guest who was sitting next to him, 'How well did Phrynichus speak when he said- [604]   The light of love doth shine in purple cheeks.' And a man from Eretria, or from Erythrae, who was a school-master, answered him,- 'You are a great man in poetry, O Sophocles; but still Phrynichus did not say well when he called purple cheeks a mark of beauty. For if a painter were to cover the cheeks of this boy with purple paint he would not be beautiful at all. And so it is not well to compare what is beautiful with what is not so.' And on this Sophocles, laughing at the Eretrian, said,- 'Then, my friend, I suppose you are not pleased with the line in Simonides which is generally considered among the Greeks to be a beautiful one- 
  The maid poured forth a gentle voice 
  From out her purple mouth. 
And you do not either like the poet who spoke of the golden-haired Apollo; for if a painter were to represent the hair of the god as actually golden, and not black, the picture would be all the worse. Nor do you approve of the poet who described women as rosy-fingered. For if any one were to dip his fingers in rosy-coloured paint he would make his hands like those of a purple-dyer, and not of a pretty woman.' And when they all laughed at this, the Eretrian was checked by the reproof; and Sophocles again turned to pursue the conversation with the boy; for he asked him, as he was brushing away the straws from the cup with his little finger, whether he saw any straws: and when he said that he did, he said, 'Blow them away, then, that you may not dirty your fingers.' And when he brought his face near the cup he held the cup nearer to his own mouth, so as to bring his own head nearer to the head of the boy. And when he was very near he took him by the hand and kissed him. And when all clapped their hands, laughing and shouting out, to see how well he had taken the boy in, he said, 'I, my friends, am practising the art of generalship, since Pericles has said that I know how to compose poetry, but not how to be a general; now has not this stratagem of mine succeeded perfectly?' And he both said and did many things of this kind in a witty manner, drinking and giving himself up to mirth: but as to political affairs he was not able nor energetic in them, but behaved as any other virtuous Athenian might have done."

[82.] G   And Hieronymus of Rhodes, in his Historical Commentaries, says that Sophocles once led a handsome boy outside the walls, in order to consort with him. The boy laid his own cloak on the grass, and they used Sophocles' cloak to cover them. When they had finished their encounter, the boy went off with Sophocles' cloak, and Sophocles was left with a boy's cloak. Naturally, this affair became the subject of gossip, and when Euripides was told about it he scoffed at Sophocles, saying that he too had used this boy, but he had not had to pay any extra, whereas Sophocles had been treated with contempt because of his licentiousness. When Sophocles heard this, he composed the following epigram, which refers to the fable about the sun and the north wind, and also hints at Euripides' adultery: 
  It was the sun, not the boy, who stripped me 
  Of my cloak, Euripides; but the north wind went 
  With you, when you made love to another man's wife. 
  You are not wise, when sowing another's field, 
  To bring Eros to court for being a snatch-thief.

[83.] G   And Theopompus, in his treatise On the Treasures of which the Temple at Delphi was plundered, [605] says that "Asopichus, being a favourite of Epaminondas, had the trophy of Leuctra represented in relief on his shield, and that he encountered danger with extraordinary gallantry; and that this shield is consecrated at Delphi, in the portico." And in the same treatise, Theopompus further alleges that "Phayllus, the tyrant of Phocis, was extremely addicted to women; but that Onomarchus used to select boys as his favourites: and that he had a favourite, the son of Pythodorus the Sicyonian, to whom, when he came to Delphi to devote his hair to the god (and he was a youth of great beauty), Onomarchus gave the offerings of the Sybarites - four golden combs. And Phayllus gave to Bromias, the daughter of Deiniades, who was a female flute-player, a silver goblet (?????????) of the Phocaeans, and a golden crown of ivy-leaves, the offering of the Peparethians. And," he says, "she was about to play the flute at the Pythian games, if she had not been hindered by the populace."

"Onomarchus also gave," as he says, "to his favourite Physcidas, a very handsome boy who was the son of Lycolas of Trichonium, a crown of laurel, the offering of the Ephesians. This boy was brought also to Philippus by his father, but was dismissed without any favour. Onomarchus also gave to Damippus, the son of Epilycus of Amphipolis, who was a youth of great beauty, a present which had been consecrated to the god by Pleisthenes. And Philomelus gave to Pharsalia, a dancing-woman from Thessaly, a golden crown of laurel-leaves, which had been offered by the Lampsacenes. But Pharsalia herself was afterwards torn to pieces at Metapontum, by the soothsayers, in the market-place, on the occasion of a voice coming forth out of the brazen laurel which the people of Metapontum had set up at the time when Aristeas of Proconnesus was sojourning among them, on his return, as he stated, from the Hyperboreans, the first moment that she was seen entering the market-place. And when men afterwards inquired into the reason for this violence, she was found to have been put to death on account of this crown which belonged to the god."

[84.] G   Now I warn you, O philosophers, who indulge in unnatural passions, and who treat the great goddess Aphrodite with impiety, to beware, lest you be destroyed in the same manner. For boys are only handsome, as Glycera the courtesan said, while they are like women: at least, this is the saying attributed to her by Clearchus.  # But my opinion is that the conduct of Cleonymus the Spartan was in strict conformity with nature, who was the first man to take such hostages as he took from the Metapontines- namely, two hundred of their most respectable and beautiful maidens; as is related by Duris the Samian, in the third book of his History of Agathocles. And I too, as is said by Epicrates in his Anti-Lais, 
  Have learnt completely all the love-songs 
  Of Sappho, Meletus, Cleomenes, and Lamynthius.

But you, my philosophical friends, even when you are in love with women . . . . .. . .. . . . . as Clearchus says. For a bull was excited by the sight of the brazen cow at Peirene; and when a picture was displayed of a bitch, and a pigeon, and a goose: a gander came up to the goose, and a dog to the bitch, and a male pigeon to the pigeon, and not one of them discovered the deception till they got close to them. But when they got near enough to touch them, they desisted; just as Cleisophus of Selymbria did. For he fell in love with a statue of Parian marble that then was at Samos, and shut himself up in the temple to gratify his affection; but when he found that he could make no impression on the coldness and unimpressibility of the stone, then he discarded his passion. And Alexis the poet mentions this circumstance in his drama entitled The Picture, where he says- 
  [606] And such another circumstance, they say, 
  Took place in Samos: there a man did fall 
  In love with a fair maiden wrought in marble, 
  And shut himself up with her in the temple.

And Philemon mentions the same fact, and says- 
  But once a man, 'tis said, did fall, at Samos, 
  In love with a marble woman; and he went 
  And shut himself up with her in the temple.

But the statue spoken of is the work of Ctesicles; as Adaeus of Mytilene tells us in his treatise On Sculptors. And Polemon, or whoever the author of the book called Helladicus is, says- "At Delphi, in the museum of the pictures, there are two boys wrought in marble; with one of which, the Delphians say, a visitor fell in love so strongly, that he made love to it, and shut himself up with it, and presented it with a crown; but when he was detected, the god ordered the Delphians, who consulted his oracle with reference to the subject, to dismiss him freely, for that he had given him a handsome reward."

[85.] G    # And even brute beasts have fallen in love with men: for there was a cock who took a fancy to a man of the name of Secundus, a cupbearer of the king; and the cock was nicknamed the Centaur. But this Secundus was a slave of Nicomedes the king of Bithynia; as Nicander informs us in the sixth book of his essay On Changes of Fortune. And, at Aegium, a goose took a fancy to a boy; as Clearchus relates in the first book of his Amatory Anecdotes. And Theophrastus, in his, essay On Love, says that the name of this boy was Amphilochus, and that he was a native of Olenus. And Hermeias the son of Hermodorus, who was a Samian by birth, says that a goose also took a fancy to Lacydes the philosopher. And in Leucadia (according to a story told by Clearchus), a peacock fell so in love with a maiden there, that when she died, the bird died too. There is a story also that, at Iasus, a dolphin took a fancy to a boy. This story is told by Duris, in the ninth book of his History; and the subject of that book is the history of Alexander, and the historian's words are these: "He likewise sent for the boy from Iasus. For near Iasus there was a boy whose name was Dionysius, and he once, when leaving the palaestra with the rest of the boys, went down to the sea and bathed; and a dolphin came forward out of the deep water to meet him, and taking him on his back, swam away with him a considerable distance into the open sea, and then brought him back again to land." But the dolphin is an animal which is very fond of men, and very intelligent, and one very susceptible of gratitude. Accordingly Phylarchus, in his twelfth book [ Fr_26 ], says- "Coeranus of Miletus, when he saw some fishermen who had caught a dolphin in a net, and who were about to cut it up, gave them some money and bought the fish, and took it down and put it back in the sea again. And after this it happened to him to be shipwrecked near Myconos, and while every one else perished, Coeranus alone was saved by a dolphin. And when, at last, he died of old age in his native country, as it so happened that his funeral procession passed along the sea-shore close to Miletus, a great shoal of dolphins appeared on that day in the harbour, keeping only a very little distance from those who were attending the funeral of Coeranus, as if they also were joining in the procession and sharing in their grief."

The same Phylarchus also relates, in the twentieth book of his History [ Fr_36 ], the great affection which was once displayed by an elephant for a boy. And his words are these: "But there was a female elephant kept with this elephant, and the name of the female elephant was Nicaea; and to her the wife of the king of India, when dying, entrusted her child, which was just a month old. And when the woman did die, the affection for the child displayed by the beast was most extraordinary; for it could not endure the child to be away; and whenever it did not see him, it was out of spirits. And so, whenever the nurse fed the infant with milk, she placed it in its cradle between the feet of the beast; [607] and if she had not done so, the elephant would not take any food; and after this, it would take whatever reeds and grass there were near, and, while the child was sleeping, beat away the flies with the bundle. And whenever the child wept, it would rock the cradle with its trunk, and lull it to sleep. And very often the male elephant did the same."

[86.] G   But you, O philosophers, are far fiercer than dolphins and elephants, and are also much more untameable; although Persaeus of Citium, in his Recollections of Banquets, says loudly,- "It is a very consistent subject of conversation at drinking-parties for men to talk of amatory matters; for we are naturally inclined to such topics after drinking. And at those times we should praise those who indulge in that kind of conversation to a moderate and temperate degree, but blame those who go to excess in it, and behave in a beastly manner. But if logicians, when assembled in a social party, were to talk about syllogisms, then a man might very fairly think that they were acting very unseasonably. And a respectable and virtuous man will at times get drunk; but they who wish to appear extraordinarily temperate, keep up this character amid their cups for a certain time, but afterwards, as the wine begins to take effect on them, they descend to every kind of impropriety and indecency. And this was the case very lately with the ambassadors who came to Antigonus from Arcadia; for they sat at dinner with great severity of countenance, and with great propriety, as they thought, not only not looking at any one of us, but not even looking at one another. But as the wine went round, and music of different kinds was introduced, and when the Thessalian dancing-women, as their fashion is, came in, and danced quite naked, except that they had girdles round their waists, then the men could not restrain themselves any longer, but jumped up off the couches, and shouted as if they were beholding a most gratifying sight; and they congratulated the king because he had it in his power to indulge in such pastimes; and they did and said a great many more vulgar things of the same kind.

"And one of the philosophers who was once drinking with us, when a flute-playing girl came in, and when there was plenty of room near him, when the girl wished to sit down near him, would not allow her, but drew himself up and looked grave. And then afterwards, when the girl was put up to auction, as is often the fashion at such entertainments, he was exceedingly eager to buy her, and quarrelled with the man who sold her, on the ground that he had knocked her down too speedily to some one else; and he said that the auctioneer had not fairly sold her. And at last this grave philosopher, he who at first would not permit the girl even to sit near him, came to blows about her."  # And perhaps this very philosopher, who came to blows about the flute-playing girl, may have been Persaeus himself; for Antigonus of Carystus, in his treatise on Zenon, makes the following statement:- "Zenon of Citium, when once Persaeus at a drinking-party bought a flute-playing girl, and after that was afraid to bring her home, because he lived in the same house with Zenon, becoming acquainted with the circumstance, brought the girl home himself, and shut her up with Persaeus." I know, also, that Polystratus the Athenian, who was a pupil of Theophrastus, and who was surnamed the Etruscan, used often to put on the garments of the female flute-players.

[87.] G   Kings, too, have shown great anxiety about musical women; as Parmenion tells us in his Letter to Alexander, which he sent to that monarch after he had taken Damascus, and after he had become master of all the baggage of Dareius. Accordingly, having enumerated all the things which he had taken, he writes as follows:- [608] "I found three hundred and twenty-nine concubines of the king, all skilled in music; and forty-six men who were skilful in making garlands, and two hundred and seventy-seven confectioners, and twenty-nine boilers of pots, and thirteen cooks skilful in preparing milk, and seventeen artists who mixed drinks, and seventy slaves who strain wine, and forty preparers of perfumes." And I say to you, O my companions, that there is no sight which has a greater tendency to gladden the eyes than the beauty of a woman. Accordingly Oeneus, in the play of the same name which was composed by Chaeremon the tragic poet, speaks of some maidens whom he had seen, and says,- 
  And one did lie with garment well thrown back, 
  Showing her snow-white bosom to the moon: 
  Another, as she lightly danced, displayed 
  The fair proportions of her left-hand side, 
  Naked- a lovely picture for the air 
  To wanton with; and her complexion white 
  Strove with the darkening shades. Another bared 
  Her lovely arms and shoulders all: 
  Another, with her robe high round her neck, 
  Concealed her bosom, but a rent below 
  Showed all her shapely thighs. I was led on, 
  Not without hope, by desire for her smiling beauty. 
  Then on the inviting asphodel they fell, 
  Plucking the dark leaves of the violet flower, 
  And crocus, which, with purple petals rising, 
  Copies the golden rays of the early sun. 
  There, too, the Persian sweetly-smelling marjoram 
  Stretched out its neck along the laughing meadow.

[88.] G   And the same poet, being passionately fond of flowers, says also in his Alphesiboea- 
  The glorious beauty of her dazzling body 
  Shone brilliant, a sweet sight to every eye; 
  And modesty, a tender blush exciting, 
  Tinted her gentle cheeks with delicate rose: 
  Her waxy hair, in gracefully modelled curls, 
  Falling as though arranged by sculptor's hand, 
  Waved in the wanton breeze luxuriant.

And in his Io he calls the flowers children of spring, where he says- 
  Strewing around sweet children of the spring.

And in his Centaur, which is a drama composed in many metres of various kinds, he calls them children of the meadow- 
  There, too, they did invade the countless host 
  Of all the new-born flowers that deck the fields, 
  Hunting with joy the offspring of the meadows.

And in his Dionysus he says- 
  The ivy, lover of the dance, 
  Child of the mirthful year.

And in his Odysseus he speaks thus of roses - 
  And in their hair they wore the choicest gifts 
  Of the Horae, the flowering, fragrant rose, 
  The loveliest foster-child of spring.

And in his Thyestes he says- 
  The brilliant rose, and modest snow-white lily.

And in his Minyae he says- 
  There was full many a fruit of Cypris to view, 
  Dark in the rich flowers in due season ripe.

[89.] G   Now there have been many women celebrated for their beauty (for, as Euripides says [ Heracles_678 ]- "Even an old bard may sing of memory"). There was, for instance, Thargelia the Milesian, who was married to fourteen different husbands, [609] so very beautiful and accomplished was she, as Hippias the Sophist says, in his book which is entitled Synagoge. But Dinon, in the fifth book of his History of Persia, and in the first part of it, says that the wife of Bagazus, who was a sister of Xerxes by the same father, (and her name was Anutis,) was the most beautiful and the most licentious of all the women in Asia. And Phylarchus, in his nineteenth book [ Fr_34 ], says that Timosa, the concubine of Oxyartes, surpassed all women in beauty, and that the king of Egypt had originally sent her as a present to Stateira, the wife of the king. And Theopompus, in the fifty-sixth book of his History, speaks of Xenopitheia, the mother of Lysandrides, as the most beautiful of all the women in Peloponnese. And the Lacedaemonians put her to death, and her sister Chryse also, when Agesilaus the king, having raised a seditious tumult in the city, procured Lysandrides, who was his enemy, to be banished by the Lacedaemonians.  # Pantica of Cyprus was also a very beautiful woman and she is mentioned by Phylarchus, in the tenth book of his History [ Fr_21 ], where he says that when she was with Olympias, the mother of Alexander, Monimus, the son of Pythion, asked her in marriage. And, as she was a very licentious woman, Olympias said to him- "O wretched man, you are marrying with your eyes, and not with your understanding." They also say that the woman who brought back Peisistratus to assume the tyranny, clad in the semblance of Athene the Saviour, was very beautiful, as indeed she ought to have been, seeing that she assumed the appearance of a goddess. And she was a seller of garlands; and Peisistratus afterwards gave her in marriage to Hipparchus his son, as Cleidemus relates in the eighth book of his Returns, where he says- "And he also gave the woman, by name Phya, who had been in the chariot with him, in marriage to his son Hipparchus. And she was the daughter of a man named Socrates. And he took for Hippias, who succeeded him in the tyranny, the daughter of Charmus the polemarch, who was extraordinarily beautiful." And it happened, as it is said, that Charmus was a great admirer of Hippias, and that he was the man who first erected a statue of Eros in the Academy, on which there is the following inscription- 
  O wily Eros, Charmus this altar raised 
  At the well-shaded bounds of the Gymnasium.

Hesiodus, also, in the third book of his Melampodia, calls Chalcis in Euboea "Land of fair women" - for the women there are very beautiful, as Theophrastus also asserts. And Nymphodorus, in his Voyage round Asia, says that there are nowhere more beautiful women than those in Tenedos, an island close to Troy.

[90.] G   I am aware, too, that on one occasion there was a contest of beauty instituted among women. And Nicias, speaking of it in his History of Arcadia, says that Cypselus instituted it, having built a city in the plain which is watered by the Alpheius; in which he established some Parrhasians, and consecrated a plot of sacred ground and an altar to Demeter of Eleusis, in whose festival it was that he had instituted this contest of beauty. And he says that the woman who gained the victory in this contest was Herodice. And even to this day this contest is continued; and the women who contend in it are called "gold-bearers" (??????????). And Theophrastus says that there is also a beauty contest for men which takes place among the Eleans, and that the decision is made with great care and deliberation; and that those who gain the victory receive arms as their prize, which Dionysius of Leuctra says are offered up to Athene. [610] And he says, too, that the victor is adorned with ribbons by his friends, and goes in procession to the temple; and that a crown of myrtle is given to him (at least this is the statement of Myrsilus, in his Historical Paradoxes). "But in some places," says the same Theophrastus, "there are contests between the women in respect of modesty and good management, as there are among the barbarians; and at other places also there are contests about beauty, on the ground that this also is entitled to honour, as for instance, there are in Tenedos and Lesbos. But they say that this is the gift of chance, or of nature; but that the honour paid to modesty ought to be one of a greater degree. For that it is in consequence of modesty that beauty is beautiful; for without modesty it is apt to lead to intemperance."

[91.] G   Now, when Myrtilus had said all this in a continuous speech; and when all were marvelling at his memory, Cynulcus said- 
  Your multifarious learning I do wonder at- 
  Though there is not a thing more vain and useless, 
  says Hippon the Atheist. But the divine Heracleitus also says-"A great variety of information does not usually give wisdom." And Timon said- 
  There is great ostentation and parade 
  Of multifarious learning, than which nothing 
  Can be more vain or useless.

For what is the use of so many names, my good grammarian, which are more calculated to overwhelm the hearers than to do them any good? And if any one were to inquire of you, who they were who were shut up in the wooden horse, you would perhaps be able to tell the names of one or two; and even this you would not do out of the verses of Stesichorus, (for that could hardly be,) but out of the Storming of Troy, by Sacadas the Argive; for he has given a catalogue of a great number of names. Nor indeed could you properly give a list of the companions of Odysseus, and say who they were who were devoured by the Cyclops, or by the Laestrygonians, and whether they were really devoured or not. And you do not even know this, in spite of your frequent mention of Phylarchus, that in the cities of the Ceans it is not possible to see either courtesans or female flute-players.

And Myrtilus said,- But where has Phylarchus stated this? For I have read through all his history.

[92.] G   And when he said,- In the twenty-third book [ Fr_42 ]; Myrtilus said- Do I not then deservedly detest all you philosophers, since you are all haters of philology,- men whom not only did Lysimachus the king banish from his own dominions, as Carystius tells us in his Historical Reminiscenses, but the Athenians did so too.  # At all events, Alexis, in his Horse, says- 
  Is this the Academy; is this Xenocrates? 
  May the gods greatly bless Demetrius 
  And all the lawgivers; for, as men say, 
  They've driven out of Attica with disgrace 
  All those who do profess to teach the youth 
  Learning and science.

 # And a certain man, named Sophocles, passed a decree to banish all the philosophers from Attica. And Philon, the friend of Aristotle, wrote an oration against him; and Demochares, on the other hand, who was the cousin of Demosthenes, composed a defence for Sophocles.  # And the Romans, who are in every respect the best of men, banished all the sophists from Rome, on the ground of their corrupting the youth of the city, though, at a subsequent time, somehow or other, they admitted them. And Anaxippus the comic poet declares your folly in his Thunder-struck, speaking thus- 
  Alas, you're a philosopher; but I 
  Do think philosophers are only wise 
  [611] In quibbling about words; in deeds they are, 
  As far as I can see, completely foolish.

It is, therefore, with good reason that many cities, and especially the city of the Lacedaemonians, as Chamaeleon says in his book on Simonides, will not admit either rhetoric or philosophy, on account of the jealousy, and strife, and profitless discussions to which they give rise; owing to which it was that Socrates was put to death; he, who argued against the judges who were given him by lot, discoursing of justice to them when they were a pack of most corrupt men. And it is owing to this, too, that Theodorus the Atheist was put to death, and that Diagoras was banished; and this latter, sailing away when he was banished, was ship-wrecked. But Theotimus, who wrote the books against Epicurus, was accused by Zenon the Epicurean, and put to death; as is related by Demetrius of Magnesia, in his treatise on People and Things which go by the same Name.

[93.] G   And, in short, according to Clearchus of Soli, you do not adopt a manly system of life, but you do really aim at a system which might become a dog; and although this animal has four excellent qualities, you select none but the worst of his qualities for your imitation. For a dog is a wonderful animal as to his power of smelling and of distinguishing what belongs to his own family and what does not; and the way in which he associates with man, and the manner in which he watches over and protects the houses of all those who are kind to him, is extraordinary. But you who imitate the dogs, do neither of these things. For you do not associate with men, nor do you distinguish between those with whom you are acquainted; and being very deficient in sensibility, you live in an indolent and indifferent manner. But while the dog is also a snarling and greedy animal, and also hard in his way of living, and naked; these habits of his you practise, being abusive and gluttonous, and, besides all this, living without a home or a hearth. The result of all which circumstances is, that you are destitute of virtue, and quite unserviceable for any useful purpose in life. For there is nothing less philosophical than those persons who are called philosophers. For whoever supposed that Aeschines, the pupil of Socrates, would have been such a man in his manners as Lysias the orator, in his speeches On the Contracts, represents him to have been; when, out of the dialogues which are extant, and generally represented to be his work, we are inclined to admire him as a decent and moderate man? Unless, indeed, those writings are in reality the work of the wise Socrates, and were given to Aeschines by Xanthippe, the wife of Socrates, after his death, which Idomeneus asserts to be the case.

[94.] G   But Lysias, in the oration which bears the title Against Aeschines, the Pupil of Socrates, for Debt (for I will recite the passage, even though it be a rather long one, on account of your excessive arrogance, O philosophers) begins in the following manner:- "I never should have imagined, O judges, that Aeschines would have dared to come into court on a trial which is so discreditable to him. For a more disgracefully false accusation than the one which he has brought forward, I do not believe it to be easy to find. For he, O judges, when he owed a sum of money with interest at three drachmae [per month] to Sosinomus the banker and Aristogeiton, came to me, and besought me not to allow him to be evicted from his own property, in consequence of this high interest. 'And I,' said he, am at this moment carrying on the trade of a perfumer; but I want capital to go on with, and I will pay you nine obols a month interest.' "

[612] A fine end to the happiness of this philosopher was the trade of a perfumer, and admirably harmonizing with the philosophy of Socrates, a man who utterly rejected the use of all perfumes and unguents! And moreover, Solon the lawgiver expressly forbade a man to devote himself to any such business: on which account Pherecrates, in his Oven, or Woman sitting up all Night, says:- 
  Why should he practise a perfumer's trade, 
  Sitting up high beneath an awning there, 
  Preparing for himself a seat on which 
  To gossip with the youths the whole day long? 
And presently afterwards he says:- 
  And no one ever saw a female cook 
  Or any fishwoman; for every class 
  Should practise arts which are best suited to it.

And after what I have already quoted, the orator proceeds to say:- "And I was persuaded by this speech of his, considering also that this Aeschines had been the pupil of Socrates, and was a man who uttered fine sentiments about virtue and justice, and who would never attempt nor venture on the actions practised by dishonest and unjust men."

[95.] G   And again, after he had stated the accusations against Aeschines, and had explained how he had borrowed the money, and how he never paid either interest or principal, and how, when an action was brought against him, he had allowed judgment to go by default, and how a branded slave of his had been put forward by him as security; and after he had brought a good many more charges of the same kind against him, the orator proceeded as follows:-

"But, O judges, I am not the only person to whom he behaves in this manner, but he treats every one who has any dealings with him in the same manner. Are not even all the wine-sellers who live near him, from whom he gets wine for his entertainments and never pays for it, bringing actions against him, having already closed their shops against him? And his neighbours are ill-treated by him to such a degree that they leave their own houses, and go and rent others which are at a distance from him. And with respect to all the contributions which he collects, he never himself puts down the remaining share which is due from him, but all the money which ever gets into this peddler's hands is lost as if it were utterly destroyed. And such a number of men come to his house daily at dawn, to ask for their money which he owes them, that passers-by suppose he must be dead, and that such a crowd can only be collected to attend his funeral.

"And those men who live in the Peiraeus have such a low opinion of him, that they think it a far less perilous business to sail to the Adriatic than to deal with him; for he thinks that the money that he borrows is much more actually his own than what his father bequeathed to him. Has he not got possession of the property of Hermaeus the perfumer, after having seduced his wife, though she was seventy years old? He pretended to be in love with her, and then treated her in such a manner that she reduced her husband and her sons to beggary, and made him a perfumer instead of a peddler! He handled the lady in this amorous manner, enjoying the 'fruit of her youth', when it would have been less trouble to him to count her teeth than the fingers of her hand, they were so much fewer. And now come forward, you witnesses, who will prove these facts. This, then, is the life of this sophist."

These, O Cynulcus, are the words of Lysias. But I, in the words of Aristarchus the tragic poet, "Saying no more, but this in self-defence," will now cease my attack upon you and the rest of the Cynics.

Athenaeus: The Deipnosophists
BOOK 14 (excerpts)

Translated by C.D.Yonge (1854). A few words and spellings have been changed.

See key to translations for an explanation of the format. The page numbers in the Greek text are shown in red. The chapter numbers in the translation are shown in green. 

[1.] G   [613] Most people, my friend Timocrates, call Dionysus frantic, because those who drink too much unmixed wine become uproarious: 
  To copious wine this insolence you owe, 
  And much your betters wine can overthrow. 
  The great Eurytion, when this frenzy stung, 
  Peirithous' roofs with frantic riot rung: 
  Boundless the Centaur raged, till one and all 
  The Lapiths rose and dragged him from the hall. [ Homer, Od_21'293 ]

For when the wine has penetrated down into the body, as Herodotus says [ 1.212 ], bad and furious language is apt to rise to the surface. And Clearchus the comic poet says in his Corinthians- 
  If all the men who to get drunk are apt, 
  Had everyday a headache before they drank 
  The wine, there is not one would drink a drop: 
  But as we now get all the pleasure first, 
  Then after we drink, we lose the whole delight 
  In the sharp pain which follows.

And Xenophon [ Ages_5.1 ] represents Agesilaus as insisting that a man ought to shun drunkenness equally with madness, and immoderate gluttony as much as idleness. But we, as we are not of the class who drink to excess, nor of the number of those who are in the habit of being intoxicated by midday, have come rather to this literary entertainment; for Ulpianus, who is always finding fault, reproved some one just now who said, I am not drunk (???????), saying,- Where do you find that word ???????? But he rejoined,- Why, in Alexis, who, in his play called the New Settler, says- 
  He did all this when drunk (???????).

[2.] G   But as, after the discussion by us of the new topics which arise, our liberal entertainer Larensis is every day constantly introducing different kinds of music, and also jesters and buffoons, let us have a little talk about them. Although I am aware that Anacharsis the Scythian, when on one occasion jesters were introduced in his company, remained without moving a muscle of his countenance; but afterwards, when a monkey was brought in, he burst out laughing, and said, "Now this fellow is laughable by his nature, but man is only so through practice." And Euripides, in his Melanippe in Chains, has said- 
  But many men, from the wish to raise a laugh, 
  Practise sharp sayings; but those sorry jesters 
  I hate who let loose their unbridled tongues 
  [614] Against the wise and good; nor do I class them 
  As men at all, but only as jokes and playthings. 
  [But women ...] 
  Tend their homes at ease, and gather up 
  Good store of wealth to keep within their houses.

And Parmeniscus of Metapontum, as Semus tells us in the fifth book of his History of Delos, a man of the highest consideration both as to family and in respect of his riches, having gone down to the cave of Trophonius, after he had come up again, was not able to laugh at all. And when he consulted the oracle on this subject, the Pythian priestess replied to him- 
  You're asking me, you laughless man, 
  About the power to laugh again; 
  Your mother will give it you at home, 
  If you with reverence to her come.

So, on this, he hoped that when he returned to his country he should be able to laugh again; but when he found that he could laugh no more now than he could before, he considered that he had been deceived; till, by some chance, he came to Delos; and as he was admiring everything he saw in the island, he came into the temple of Leto, expecting to see some very superb statue of the mother of Apollo; but when he saw only a wooden shapeless figure, he unexpectedly burst out laughing. And then, comparing what had happened with the oracle of the god, and being cured of his infirmity, he honoured the goddess greatly.

[3.] G   Now Anaxandrides, in his Old Man's Madness, says that it was Rhadamanthys and Palamedes who invented the fashion of jesters; and his words are these: 
  And yet we labour much. 
  But Palamedes first, and Rhadamanthys, 
  Sought those who bring no other contribution, 
  But say amusing things.

Xenophon also, in his Symposium [ 1.11 ], mentions jesters; introducing Philippus, of whom he speaks in the following manner:- "But Philippus the jester, having knocked at the door, told the boy who answered, to tell the guests who he was, and that he was desirous to be admitted; and he said that he came provided with everything which could qualify him for supping at other people's expense. And he said, too, that his boy was in a good deal of distress because he had brought nothing, and because he had had no dinner." And Hippolochus the Macedonian, in his Letter to Lynceus [ Athen_4.130'c ], mentions the jesters Mandrogenes and Straton the Athenian. And at Athens there was a great deal of this kind of cleverness. Accordingly, in the Heracleium at Diomeia they assembled to the number of sixty, and they were always spoken of in the city as amounting to that number, in such expressions as- "The sixty said this," and, "I am come from the sixty." And among them were Callimedon, nicknamed the Crab, and Deinias, and also Mnasigeiton and Menaechmus, as Telephanes tells us in his treatise On the City. And their reputation for amusing qualities was so great, that Philippus the Macedonian heard of it, and sent them a talent to engage them to write out their witticisms and send them to him. And the fact of this king having been a man who was very fond of jokes is testified to us by Demosthenes the orator in his Philippics [ Olynth_2'19 ]. Demetrius Poliorcetes was a man very eager for anything which could make him laugh, as Phylarchus tells us in the sixth book of his History [ Fr_12 ]. And he it was who said, "that the palace of Lysimachus was in no respect different from a comic theatre; for that there was no one there with a name longer than two syllables;" (meaning to laugh at Bithys and Paris, who had more influence than anybody with Lysimachus, and at some others of his friends;) "but that his own friends were Peucestes, and Menelaus, and Oxythemis." But when Lysimachus heard this, he said,- "I, however, never saw a prostitute on the stage in a tragedy;" referring to Lamia the female flute-player. [615] And when this was reported to Demetrius, he rejoined,- "But the prostitute who is with me, lives in a more modest manner than the Penelope who is with him."

[4.] G   And we have mentioned before this that Sulla, the general of the Romans, was very fond of anything laughable.  # And Lucius Anicius, who was also a general of the Romans, after he had subdued the Illyrians, and brought with him Genthius the king of the Illyrians as his prisoner, with all his children, when he was celebrating his triumphal games at Rome, did many things of the most laughable character possible, as Polybius relates in his thirtieth book [ 30.22 ]:- "For having sent for the most eminent artists from Greece, and having erected a very large theatre in the Circus, he first of all introduced all the flute-players. And these were Theodorus the Boeotian, and Theopompus, and Hermippus, surnamed Lysimachus, who were the most eminent men in their profession. And having brought these men in front of the stage after the chorus was over, he ordered them all to play the flute. And as they accompanied their music with appropriate gestures, he sent to them and said that they were not playing well, and desired them to be more vehement. And while they were in perplexity, one of the lictors told them that what Anicius wished was that they should turn round so as to advance towards each other, and give a representation of a battle. And then the flute-players, taking this hint, and adopting a movement not unsuited to their habitual wantonness, caused a great tumult and confusion; and turning the middle of the chorus towards the extremities, the flute-players, all blowing unpremeditated notes, and letting their flutes be all out of tune, rushed upon one another in turn: and at the same time the choruses, all making a noise to correspond to them, and coming on the stage at the same time, rushed also upon one another, and then again retreated, advancing and retreating alternately. But when one of the chorus-dancers tucked up his garment, and suddenly turned round and raised his hands against the flute-player who was coming towards him, as if he was going to box with him, then there arose an extraordinary clapping and shouting on the part of the spectators. And while all these men were fighting as if in regular battle, two dancers were introduced into the orchestra with castanets, and four boxers mounted the stage, with trumpeters and horn-players: and when all these men were striving together, the spectacle was quite indescribable: and as for the tragedians," says Polybius, "if I were to attempt to describe what took place with respect to them, I should be thought by some people to be jesting."

[5.] G   Now when Ulpianus had said thus much, and when all were laughing at the idea of this exhibition of Anicius, a discussion arose about travelling acrobats (??????). And the question was asked, Whether there was any mention of these men in any of the ancient authors? for of the jugglers (????????????) we have already spoken [ 1.20'a ]: and Magnus said, Dionysius of Sinope, the comic poet, in his play entitled The Namesakes, mentions Cephisodorus the ?????? in the following terms- 
  They say that once there was a man at Athens, 
  A ??????, named Cephisodorus, who 
  Devoted all his life to this pursuit; 
  And he, whenever to a hill he came, 
  Ran straight up to the top; but then descending 
  Came slowly down, and leaning on a pole.

And Nicostratus also mentions him in his Syrian- 
  They say the ?????? Cephisodorus once 
  Most wittily stationed in a narrow lane 
  A crowd of men with bundles in their arms, 
  So that no one else could pass that way at all.

[616] There was also a man named Pantaleon, who is mentioned by Theognetus, in his Slave devoted to his Master- 
  Pantaleon himself did none deceive (??????) 
  Save only foreigners, and those, too, such 
  As never had heard of him: and often he, 
  After a drunken revel, would pour forth 
  All sorts of jokes, striving to raise a laugh 
  By his unceasing chattering.

And Chrysippus the philosopher in the fifth book of his treatise On Honour and Pleasure, writes thus of Pantaleon:- "But Pantaleon the ??????, when he was at the point of death, deceived every one of his sons separately, telling each of them that he was the only one to whom he was revealing the place where he had buried his gold; so that they afterwards went and dug together to no purpose, and then found out that they had been all deceived."

[6.] G   And our party was not deficient in men fond of raising a laugh by jesting speeches. And respecting a man of this kind, Chrysippus subsequently, in the same book, writes as follows:- "Once when a man fond of jests was about to be put to death by the executioner, he said that he wished to die like the swan, singing a song; and when he gave him leave, he ridiculed him." And Myrtilus having had a good many jokes cut on him by people of this sort, got angry, and said that Lysimachus the king had done a very sensible thing;  # for he, hearing Telesphorus, one of his lieutenants, at an banquet, ridiculing Arsinoe (and she was the wife of Lysimachus), as being a woman in the habit of vomiting, by quoting the following line- 
  You are starting trouble, introducing this vomiting woman (????' ???????)
ordered him to be put in a cage (????????) and carried about like a wild beast, and fed; and he punished him in this way till he died. But if you, O Ulpianus, raise a question about the word ????????, it occurs in Hypereides the orator; and the passage you may find out for yourself.

And Tachos the king of Egypt ridiculed Agesilaus king of Lacedaemon, when he came to him as an ally (for he was a very short man), and lost his kingdom in consequence, as Agesilaus abandoned his alliance. And the expression of Tachos was as follows: 
  The mountain was in labour; Zeus 
  Was greatly frightened: lo! a mouse was born. 
And Agesilaus hearing of this, and being indignant at it, said, "I will one day prove a lion to you." So afterwards, when the Egyptians revolted (as Theopompus relates, and Lyceas of Naucratis confirms the statement in his History of Egypt), Agesilaus refused to cooperate with him, and, in consequence, Tachos lost his kingdom, and fled to the Persians.

  * * * * *

[12.] G   [620] Moreover, there were rhapsodists also present at our entertainments: for Larensis delighted in the reciters of Homer to an extraordinary degree; so that one might call Cassander the king of Macedonia a trifler in comparison of him; concerning whom Carystius, in his Historical Recollections, tells us that he was so devoted to Homer, that he could say the greater part of his poems by heart; and he had a copy of the Iliad and the Odyssey written out with his own hand. And that these reciters of Homer were called Homerists also, Aristocles has told us in his treatise On Choruses. But those who are now called Homerists were first introduced on the stage by Demetrius Phalereus.

Now Chamaeleon, in his essay on Stesichorus, says that not only the poems of Homer, but those also of Hesiodus and Archilochus, and also of Mimnermus and Phocylides, were often recited to the accompaniment of music; and Clearchus, in the first book of his treatise On Pictures, says- "Simonides of Zacynthus used to sit in the theatres on a lofty chair reciting the verses of Archilochus." And Lysanias, in the first book of his treatise On Iambic Poets, says that Mnasion the rhapsodist used in his public recitations to deliver some of the Iambics of Simonides. And Cleomenes the rhapsodist, at the Olympic games, recited the Purification of Empedocles, as is asserted by Dicaearchus in his History of Olympia. And Jason, in the third book of his treatise On the Temples of Alexander, says that Hegesias, the comic actor, recited the works of Herodotus in the great theatre at Alexandria, and that Hermophantus recited the poems of Homer.

[13.] G   And the men called hilarodists (whom some people at the present day call simodists, as Aristocles tells us in his first book On Choruses, because Simus of Magnesia was the most celebrated of all the poets of joyous songs,) frequently come to our attention. And Aristocles also gives a regular list of performers in his treatise On Music, where he speaks in the following manner:- "The magodist- but he is the same as the lysiodist." But Aristoxenus says that magodist is the name given to an actor who acts both male and female characters; but that he who acts a woman's part in male [costume] is called a lysiodist. And they both sing the same songs, and in other respects they are similar.

The ionicologus recites the poems of Sotades, and what before his time were called Ionic poems, such as those of Alexander the Aetolian, and Pyres the Milesian, and Alexas, and other poets of the same kind; and [this reciter] is also called cinaedologus. And Sotades of Maroneia was very notorious for this kind of poetry, as Carystius of Pergamum says in his essay on Sotades; and so was the son of Sotades, Apollonius. This latter also wrote an essay on his father's poetry, from which one may easily see the unbridled licence of language which Sotades allowed himself: abusing Lysimachus the king in Alexandria, and, when at the court ef Lysimachus, abusing Ptolemy Philadelphus, and in different cities speaking ill of different sovereigns; on which account, at last, he met with the punishment that he deserved. [621]  # For he had said many bitter things against Ptolemy the king, and especially this, after he had heard that he had married his sister Arsinoe,- 
  He pierced forbidden fruit with deadly sting. 
But when he had sailed from Alexandria (as Hegesander, in his Reminiscences, relates), and thought that he had escaped all danger, Patroclus, the general of Ptolemy, caught him in the island of Caunus. Patroclus shut him up in a leaden vessel, and carried him into the open sea and drowned him. And here is an example of Sotades' poetry: about Philenus, who was the father of Theodorus the flute-player,  he wrote these lines:- 
  And he, opening the door which leads from the back-side, 
  Sent forth vain thunder from a leafy cave, 
  Such as a mighty ploughing ox might utter.

  * * * * *

[29.] G   [630] But Aristoxenus says that the Pyrrhic dance derives its name from Pyrrhichus, who was a Lacedaemonian by birth; and that even to this day Pyrrhichus is a Lacedaemonian name. And the dance itself, being of a warlike character, shows that it is the invention of some Lacedaemonian; for the Lacedaemonians are a martial race, and their sons learn military marches which they call enoplia. And the Lacedaemonians themselves in their wars recite the poems of Tyrtaeus, and move in time to those tunes. But Philochorus [ Fr_216 ] asserts that the Lacedaemonians, when owing to the generalship of Tyrtaeus they had subdued the Messenians, introduced a regular custom in their expeditions, that whenever they were at supper, and had sung the paean, they should also sing one of Tyrtaeus's hymns as a solo, one after another; and that the polemarch should be the judge, and should give a piece of meat as a prize to him who sang best. [631] But the Pyrrhic dance is not preserved now among any other people of Greece; and at the same time that it has fallen into disuse, their wars also have been brought to a conclusion; but it continues in use among the Lacedaemonians alone, being a sort of prelude preparatory to war: and all who are more than five years old in Sparta learn to dance the Pyrrhic dance. But the Pyrrhic dance as it exists in our time, appears to be a sort of Dionysiac dance, and a little more pacific than the old one; for the dancers carry thyrsi instead of spears, and they point and dart canes at one another, and carry torches. And in their dances, they portray Dionysus and the Indians, and the story of Pentheus: and they require for the Pyrrhic dance the most beautiful melodies, and what are called the "stirring" tunes.

  * * * * *

[37.] G   [635] But some people raise a question how, as the magadis did not exist in the time of Anacreon (for instruments with many strings were never seen till after his time), Anacreon can possibly mention it, as he does when he says- 
  I hold my magadis and sing, 
  Striking loud the twentieth string, 
  O Leucaspis.

But Poseidonius [ Fr_107 ] asserts that Anacreon mentions three kinds of melodies, the Phrygian, the Dorian, and the Lydian; for that these were the only melodies with which he was acquainted. And as every one of these is executed on seven strings, he says that it was very nearly correct of Anacreon to speak of twenty strings, as he only omits one for the sake of speaking in round numbers. But Poseidonius is ignorant that the magadis is an ancient instrument, though Pindarus says plainly enough that Terpander invented the barbitos to correspond to, and answer the pectis in use among the Lydians- 
  The sweet responsive lyre 
  Which long ago the Lesbian bard, 
  Terpander, did invent, sweet ornament 
  To the luxurious Lydian feasts, when he 
  Heard the high-toned pectis.

Now the pectis and the magadis are the same instrument, as Aristoxenus tells us, and Menaechmus the Sicyonian too, in his treatise On Artists. And this latter author says that Sappho, who is more ancient than Anacreon, was the first person to use the pectis. Now, that Terpander is more ancient than Anacreon, is evident from the following considerations:- Terpander was the first man who ever got the victory at the Carneian games, as Hellanicus tells us in his Victors at the Carneia, which he wrote in verse and in prose.

The first establishment of the Carneia took place in the twenty-sixth Olympiad [ 676-673 B.C. ], as Sosibius tells us in his essay On Dates. But Hieronymus, in his treatise On Harp-players, which is the subject of his fifth book On Poets, says that Terpander was a contemporary of Lycurgus the law-giver, who, it is agreed by all men, was, with Iphitus of Elis, the author of that establishment of the Olympic games from which the first Olympiad is reckoned [ 776 B.C. ]. But Euphorion, in his treatise On the Isthmian Games, says that the instruments with many strings are altered only in their names; but that the use of them is very ancient.

[38.] G   [636] However, Diogenes the tragic poet represents the pectis as differing from the magadis; for in his Semele he says- 
  And now I hear the turban-wearing women, 
  Votaries of the Asiatic Cybele, 
  The wealthy Phrygians' daughters, loudly sounding 
  With drums, and bull-roarers, and brazen-clashing 
  Cymbals, their hands each striking in concert, 
  Pour forth a wise and healing hymn to the gods. 
  Likewise the Lydian and the Bactrian maids 
  Who dwell beside the Halys, loudly worship 
  The Tmolian goddess Artemis, who loves 
  The laurel shade of the thick leafy grove, 
  Striking the clear three-cornered pectis, and 
  Raising responsive tunes upon the magadis, 
  While flutes in Persian manner neatly joined 
  Accompany the chorus.

And Phillis of Delos, in the second book of his treatise On Music, also asserts that the pectis is different from the magadis. And his words are these- "There are the phoenix, the pectis, the magadis, the sambuca, the iambyca, the triangles, the clepsiambus, the scindapsus, and the nine-string." For, he says that "the lyre to which they sang iambics, they called the iambyca, and the instrument to which they sang them in such a manner as to vary the metre a little, they called the clepsiambus, while the magadis was an instrument uttering a sound an octave apart, and equally in tune for every portion of the singers. And besides these there were instruments of other kinds also; for there was the barbitos, or barmus, and many others, some with strings, and some with sounding-boards."

[39.] G   There were also some instruments besides those which were blown into, and those which were used with different strings, which gave forth only sounds of a simple nature, such as the castanets (????????), which are mentioned by Dicaearchus, in his essay On the Manners and Customs of Greece, where he says, that formerly certain instruments were in very frequent use, in order to accompany women while dancing and singing; and when any one touched these instruments with their fingers they uttered a shrill sound. And he says that this is plainly shown in the hymn to Artemis, which begins thus- 
  Artemis, now my mind will have me utter 
  A pleasing song in honour of your deity, 
  While this my comrade strikes with nimble hand 
  The well-gilt brazen-sounding castanets.

And Hermippus, in his play called The Gods, gives the word for rattling the castanets, ?????????????, saying- 
  And beating down the limpets from the rocks, 
  They make a noise like castanets (??????????????).

But Didymus says, that some people, instead of the lyre, are in the habit of striking oyster-shells and cockle-shells against one another, and by these means contrive to play a tune in time to the dancers, as Aristophanes also intimates in his Frogs [ 1304 ].

[40.] G   But Artemon, in the first book of his treatise On the Dionysiac System, as he calls it, says that Timotheus the Milesian appears to many men to have used an instrument of more strings than were necessary, namely, the magadis, on which account he was chastised by the Lacedaemonians as having corrupted the ancient music. And when some one was going to cut away the superfluous strings from his lyre, he showed them a little statue of Apollo which they had, which held in its hand a lyre with an equal number of strings, and which was tuned in the same manner; and so he was acquitted. But Duris, in his treatise On Tragedy, says that the magadis was named after Magodis, who was a Thracian by birth. But Apollodorus, in his Reply to the Letter of Aristocles, says- "That which we now call psalterium is the same instrument which was formerly called magadis; but that which used to be called the clepsiambus, and the triangle, and the elymus, and the nine-string, have fallen into comparative disuse." [637] And Alcman says- 
  And put away the magadis.

And Sophocles, in his Thamyras, says- 
  And well-compacted lyres and magadides, 
  And other highly-polished instruments, 
  From which the Greeks do make the sweetest sounds.

But Telestes, in his dithyrambic poem, called Hymenaeus, says that the magadis was an instrument with five strings, using the following expressions- 
  And each a different strain awakens,- 
  One struck the loud horn-sounded magadis, 
  And in the five-fold number of tight strings 
  Moved his hand to and fro most rapidly.

I am acquainted, too, with another instrument which the Thracian kings use in their banquets, as Nicomedes tells us in his essay on Orpheus. Now Ephorus, and Scamon in his treatise On Inventions, say that this instrument called the phoenix derives its name from having been invented by the Phoenicians. But Semus of Delos, in the first book of his History of Delos, says that it is so called because its ribs are made of the palm-tree (??????) which grows in Delos. The same writer, Semus, says that the first person who used the sambuca was Sibylla . . . the before-mentioned Scamon, and that the instrument derives its name from having been invented by a man named Sambyx.

[41.] G   And concerning the instrument called the tripod (this also is a musical instrument) the before-mentioned Artemon writes as follows- "And that is how it is that there are many instruments, as to which it is even uncertain whether they ever existed; as, for instance, the tripod of Pythagoras of Zacynthus. For as it was in fashion but a very short time, and as, either because the fingering of it appeared exceedingly difficult, or for some other reason, it was very soon disused, it has escaped the notice of most writers altogether. But the instrument was in form very like the Delphian tripod, and it derived its name from it; but it was used like a triple harp. For its feet stood on some pedestal which admitted of being easily turned round, just as the legs of movable chairs are made; and along the three intermediate spaces between the feet, strings were stretched; an arm being placed above each, and tuning-pegs, to which the strings were attached, below. And on the top there was the usual ornament of a basin, and of some other ornaments which were attached to it; all which gave it a very elegant appearance, and it emitted a very powerful sound. And Pythagoras assigned the three harmonies - the Dorian, the Lydian, and Phrygian - to the three spaces. And he himself sitting on a chair made on the same principles and after the same pattern, putting out his left hand so as to take hold of the instrument, and using the plectrum in his other hand, moved the pedestal with his foot very easily, so as to use whichever side of the instrument he chose to begin with; and then again turning to the other side he went on playing, and then he changed to the third side. And so rapidly did the easy movement of the pedestal, when touched by the foot, bring the various sides under his hand, and so very rapid was his fingering and execution, that if a person had not seen what was being done, but had judged only by his ear, he would have fancied that he was listening to three harp-players all playing on different instruments. But this instrument, though it was so greatly admired, after his death rapidly fell into disuse."

[42.] G   Now the system of playing the harp without any vocal accompaniment, was, as Menaechmus informs us, first introduced by Aristonicus the Argive, who was a contemporary of Archilochus, and lived in Corcyra. But Philochorus, in the third book of his Atthis [ Fr_23 ], says- "Lysander the Sicyonian harp-player was the first person who ever changed the art of pure instrumental performance, dwelling on the long tones, and producing a very rich sound, and adding also to the harp the music of the flute; and this last addition was first introduced by Epigonus; [638] and taking away the jejuneness which existed in the music of those who played the harp alone without any vocal accompaniment, he first introduced various beautiful modifications on that instrument; and he played on the different kinds of harp called iambyca and magadis, and the so-called syrigmus. And he was the first person who ever attempted to change his instrument while playing. And afterwards, adding dignity to the business, he was the first person to institute a chorus [of players]." And Menaechmus says that Dion of Chios was the first person who ever played on the harp an ode such as is used at libations to the honour of Dionysus. Timomachus, in his History of Cyprus, says that Stesander the Samian added further improvements to his art, and was the first person who at Delphi sang to the accompaniment of his lyre the battles narrated by Homer, beginning with the Odyssey. But others say that the first person who ever played amatory songs on his harp was Ametor, the Eleuthernaean, who did so in his own city; and his descendants are called Ametoridae.

Aristoxenus says that just as some men have composed parodies on hexameter verses, for the sake of exciting a laugh; so, too, others have parodied the verses which were sung to the harp, in which pastime Oenopas led the way. And he was imitated by Polyeuctus the Achaean, and by Diocles of Cynaetha. There have also been poets who have composed indecent songs, concerning whom Phaenias of Eresus speaks in his writings Against the Sophists, where he writes thus:- "Telenicus the Byzantian, and also Argas, being both authors of indecent songs, were men who, as far as that kind of poetry could go, were accounted clever. But they never even attempted to rival the songs of Terpander or Phrynis." And Alexis mentions Argas, in his Bareback Rider, thus- 
  (A)   Here is a poet who has gained the prize 
  In choruses. 
  (B)   What is his style of poetry ? 
  (A)   A noble kind. 
  (B)   How will he stand comparison 
  With Argas? 
  (A)   He's a whole day's journey better.

And Anaxandrides, in his Heracles, says- 
  For he appears a really clever man. 
  How gracefully he takes the instrument, 
  Then plays at once . . . 
  When I have eaten my fill, I then incline 
  To send you off to sing a match with Argas, 
  That you, my friend, may thus the sophists conquer.

  * * * * *

[53.] G   [645] There was also a kind [of cake] called diaconium. Pherecrates says- 
  He was so greedy that he ate a whole 
  Diaconium up, besides an amphiphon.

But the amphiphon was a kind of cheesecake consecrated to Artemis, having figures of lighted torches round it. Philemon, in his Beggar, or Woman of Rhodes, says- 
  Artemis, mistress dear, I bring you now 
  This amphiphon, and these libations holy.

Diphilus also mentions it in his Hecate. Philochorus [ Fr_86 ] also mentions the fact of its being called amphiphon, and of its being brought into the temples of Artemis, and also to the crossroads, on the day when the moon is overtaken at its setting by the rising of the sun; and so the sky is doubly light (???????).

There is the basynias too. Semus, in the second book of his History of Delos, says- "In the island of Hecate, the Delians sacrifice to Iris, offering her the cheesecakes called basyniae; and this is a cake of wheat-flour, and suet, and honey, boiled up together: and what is called ??????? consists of a fig and three nuts."

There are also cheesecakes called strepti and ne?lata. Both these kinds are mentioned by Demosthenes the orator, in his Speech in defence of Ctesiphon concerning the Crown [ 260 ].

There are also epichyta. Nicochares, in his Handicrafts-men, says- 
  I've loaves, and barley-bread, and bran, and flour, 
  And rolls, a toasted bun, and honeyed cheesecakes, 
  Moulded cakes (????????), barley-gruel, and common cheesecakes, 
  Barley-cakes (??????????), and fried bread.

But Pamphilus says that the epichyton is the same kind of cheesecake as that which is called attanites. And Hipponax mentions the attanites in the following lines- 
  Not eating hares or woodcocks, 
  Nor mingling small fried loaves with cakes of sesame, 
  Nor dipping fried cakes (?????????) in honeycombs.

There is also the creium. This is a kind of cheesecake which, at Argos, is brought to the bridegroom from the bride; and it is roasted on the coals, and the friends of the bridegroom are invited to eat it; and it is served up with honey, as Philetas tells us in his Miscellanies.

There is also the glycinas: this is a cheesecake in fashion among the Cretans, made with sweet wine and oil, as Seleucus tells us in his Dialects.

There is also the empeptas. The same author speaks of this as a cheesecake made of wheat, hollow and well-shaped, like those which are called crepides; being rather a kind of casing into which they put those cheesecakes which are really made with cheese.

  * * * * *

[61.] G   [649] The Syrian being refuted by these arguments, and being a good deal annoyed, said- But I see here on the table some pistachio nuts (????????); and if you can tell me what author has ever spoken of them, I will give you, not ten golden staters, as that Pontic trifler [Heracleides] has it, but this goblet. And as Democritus made no reply, he said, But since you cannot answer me, I will tell you; Nicander of Colophon, in his Theriaca [ 891] , mentions them, and says- 
  Pistachio nuts (????????) upon the highest branches, 
  Like almonds to the sight.

The word is also written ????????, in the line- 
  And almond-like pistachios (????????) were there.

And Poseidonius the Stoic, in the third book of his History [ Fr_3 ], writes thus: "But both Arabia and Syria produce the peach, and the nut which is called pistachio (?????????); which bears a fruit in bunches like bunches of grapes, of a sort of tawny white, long shaped, like tears, and the nuts lie on one another like berries. But the kernel is of a light green, and it is less juicy than the pine-cone, but it has a more pleasant smell."  And the brothers [Quintilii] who together composed the Georgics, write thus, in the third book- "There is also the ash, and the turpentine tree, which the Syrians call ????????." And these people spell the word ???????? with a ?, but Nicander writes it with an aspirate, ????????, and Poseidonius ????????.

  * * * * *

[66.] G   [651] And Melanippides of Melos, in his Danaides, calls the fruit of the palm-tree by the name of ????????, mentioning [the daughters of Danaus] in this manner:- "They had the appearance of inhabitants of the shades below, not of human beings; nor had they voices like women; but they drove about in chariots with seats, through the woods and groves, just as wild beasts do, holding in their hands the sacred frankincense, and the fragrant dates (????????), and cassia, and the delicate perfumes of Syria."

[652] And Aristotle, in his treatise On Plants, speaks thus: "The dates (????????) without stones, which some call eunuchs and others call seedless." Hellanicus has also called the fruit ??????, in his Journey to the Temple of Ammon, if at least the book be a genuine one; and so has Phormus the comic poet, in his Atalantae. But concerning those that are called the Nicolaus-dates, which are imported from Syria, I can give you this information; that they received this name from Augustus the emperor, because he was exceedingly fond of the fruit, and because Nicolaus of Damascus, who was his friend, was constantly sending him presents of it. And this Nicolaus was a philosopher of the Peripatetic school, and wrote a very voluminous history.

[67.] G   Now with respect to dried figs: those which came from Attica were always considered a great deal the best. Accordingly Dinon, in his History of Persia, says- "And they used to serve up at the royal table all the fruits which the earth produces as far as the king's dominions extend, being brought to him from every district as a sort of first-fruits. And (?) Xerxes did not think it fitting for the kings either to eat or drink anything which came from any foreign country; and this idea gradually acquired the force of a law. For once, when one of the eunuchs brought the king, among the rest of the dishes at dessert, some Athenian dried figs, the king asked where they came from. And when he heard that they came from Athens, he forbade those who had bought them to buy them for him any more, until it should be in his power to take them whenever he chose, and not to buy them. And it is said that the eunuch did this on purpose, with a view to remind him of the expedition against Attica." And Alexis, in his Pilot, says- 
  Then came in figs, the emblem of fair Athens, 
  And bunches of sweet thyme.

And Lynceus, in his letter to the comic poet, Poseidippus, says- "In the delineation of the tragic passions, I do not think that Euripides is at all superior to Sophocles, but in dried figs, I do think that Attica is superior to every other country on earth." And in his letter to Diagoras, he writes thus:- "But this country opposes to the chelidonian dried figs those which are called brigindarides, which in their name indeed are barbarous, but which in delicious flavour are not at all less Attic than the others. And Phoenicides, in his Hated Woman, says- 
  (A)   They celebrate the praise of myrtle-berries, 
  Of honey, of the Propylaea, and of figs; 
  Now these I tasted when I first arrived- 
  (B)   And the Propylaea? 
  (A)   Yet have I found nothing 
  Which to a woodcock can for taste compare.

In which lines we must take notice of the mention of the woodcock. But Philemon, in his treatise On Attic Names, says that "the most excellent dried figs are those called aegalides; and that Aegila is the name of a deme in Attica, which derives its name from a hero called Aegilus; but that the dried figs of a reddish black colour are called chelidonian." Theopompus also, in the Peace, praising the Teithrasian figs, speaks thus- 
  Barley cakes, cheesecakes, and Teithrasian figs.

But dried figs were so very much sought after by all men, (for really, as Aristophanes says- "There's really nothing nicer than dried figs;") that even Amitrochates, the king of the Indians, wrote to Antiochus, entreating him (it is Hegesander who tells this story) to buy and send him some sweet wine, [653] and some dried figs, and a sophist; and that Antiochus wrote to him in answer, "The dried figs and the sweet wine we will send you; but it is not lawful for a sophist to be sold in Greece." The Greeks were also in the habit of eating dried figs roasted, as Pherecrates proves by what he says in the Coriann?, where we find- 
  But pick me out some of those roasted figs.

And a few lines later he says- 
  Will you not bring me here some black dried figs ? 
  Do you understand ? Among the Mariandyni, 
  That barbarous tribe, they call these black dried figs 
  Their pots.

I am aware, too, that Pamphilus has mentioned a kind of dried figs, which he calls procnides.

[68.] G   That the word ?????? is common for a bunch of grapes is known to every one; and Crates, in the second book of his Attic Dialect, uses the word ???????, although it appears to be a word of Asiatic origin; saying that in some of the ancient hymns the word ??????? is used for ??????, as in the following line- 
  Thick hanging with the dusky grapes (????????? ) themselves.

And that the word ??????? is used by Homer is known to every one. But Plato, in the eighth book of his Laws [ 844'd ], uses both ?????? and ???????, where he says- "Whoever tastes wild fruit, whether it be grapes (???????) or figs, before the time of the vintage arrives, which falls at the time of the rising of Arcturus, whether it be on his own farm, or on any one else's land, shall be fined fifty sacred drachmas to be paid to Dionysus, if he plucked them off his own land; but a mina if he gather them on a neighbour's estate; but if he take them from any other place, two-thirds of a mina. But whoever chooses to gather the grapes (??? ????????), which are now called the noble grapes, or the figs called the noble figs, if he gather them from his own trees, let him gather them as he pleases, and when he pleases; but if he gathers them from the trees of any one else without having obtained the leave of the owner, then, in accordance with the law which forbids any one to move what he has not placed, he shall be invariably punished." These are the words of the divine Plato; but I ask now what is this noble grape (???????), and this noble fig that he speaks of? And you may all consider this point while I am discussing the other dishes which are on the table. And Masurius said- 
  But let us not postpone this till to-morrow, 
  Still less till the day after.

When the philosopher says ???????, he means ??????, generous, as Archilochus also uses the word- 
  Come hither, you are generous (????????); 
or, perhaps, he means ?????????????; that is to say, grafted. For Aristotle speaks of grafted pears, and calls them ???????????. And Demosthenes, in his speech in defence of Ctesiphon [ 262 ], has the sentence, "gathering figs, and grapes (??????), and olives." And Xenophon, in his Oeconomicus [ 19'19 ], says, "grapes (??? ????????) are ripened by the sun." And our ancestors also have been acquainted with the practice of steeping grapes in wine, Accordingly Eubulus, in his Glued Together, says- 
  But take these grapes (??????), and in neat wine pound them, 
  And pour upon them many cups of water. 
  Then make him eat them when well steeped in wine.

And the poet, who is the author of the Chiron, which is generally attributed to Pherecrates, says- 
  Almonds and apples, and the arbutus first, 
  And myrtle-berries, pastry, too, and grapes 
  Well steeped in wine; and marrow.

And that every sort of autumn fruit was always plentiful at Athens, Aristophanes testifies in his Seasons. Why, then, should that appear strange which Aethlius the Samian asserts in the fifth book of his Samian Chronicles, where he says, "The fig, and the grape, and the medlar, and the apple, and the rose grow twice a-year"? [654] And Lynceus, in his letter to Diagoras, praising the Nicostrateian grape, which grows in Attica, and comparing it to the Rhodian grapes, says, "As rivals of the Nicostrateian grapes they grow the Hipponeian grape; which after the month Hecatombaeon (like a good servant) has constantly the same good disposition towards its masters."

[69.] G   But as you have had frequent discussions about meats, and birds, and pigeons, I also will tell you all that I, after a great deal of reading, have been able to find out in addition to what has been previously stated. Now the word ??????????? (pigeon) may be found used by Menander in his Concubine, where he says- 
  He waits a little while, and then runs up 
  And says- "I've bought some pigeons (??????????) for you."

And so Nicostratus, in his Delicate Woman, says- 
  These are the things I want,- a little bird, 
  And then a pigeon (???????????) and a paunch.

And Anaxandrides, in his Rival in Love, has the line- 
  For bringing in some pigeons (??????????) and some sparrows.

And Phrynichus, in his Tragedians, says- 
  Bring him a pigeon (???????????) for three obols.

Now with respect to the pheasant, Ptolemy the king, in the twelfth book of his Commentaries, speaking of the palace which there is at Alexandria, and of the animals which are kept in it, says, "They have also pheasants, which they call ???????, which they not only used to send for from Media, but they also used to put the eggs under broody hens, by which means they raised a number, so as to have enough for food; for they call it very excellent eating." Now this is the expression of a most magnificent monarch, who confesses that he himself has never tasted a pheasant, but who used to keep these birds as a sort of treasure. But if he had ever seen such a sight as this, when, in addition to all those which have been already eaten, a pheasant is also placed before each individual, he would have added another book to the existing twenty-four of that celebrated history, which he calls his Commentaries. And Aristotle or Theophrastus, in his Commentaries, says, "In pheasants, the male is not only as much superior to the female as is usually the case, but he is so in an infinitely greater degree."

[70.] G    # But if the before-mentioned king [Ptolemy] had seen the number of peacocks also which exists at Rome, he would have fled to the sacred senate, as though he had a second time been driven out of his kingdom by his brother. For the multitude of these birds is so great at Rome, that Antiphanes the comic poet, in his Soldier or Tychon, may seem to have been inspired by the spirit of prophecy, when he said- 
  When the first man imported to this city 
  A pair of peacocks, they were thought a rarity, 
  But now they are more numerous than quails; 
  So also, if you search and find one good man, 
  He will be sure to have five worthless sons.

And Alexis, in his Lamp, says- 
  That he should have devoured so vast a sum! 
  Why if (by earth I swear) I fed on hares' milk 
  And peacocks, I could never spend so much.

And that they used to keep them tame in their houses, we learn from Strattis, in his Pausanias, where he says- 
  Of equal value with your many trifles, 
  And peacocks, which you breed up for their feathers.

And Anaxandrides, in his Melilotus, says- 
  [655] Is it not a mad idea to breed up peacocks, 
  When for the same cost one can buy two statues?

And Anaxilaus, in his Bird Feeders, says- 
  Besides all this, tame peacocks, loudly croaking.

Menodotus the Samian also, in his treatise On the Treasures in the Temple of the Samian Hera, says: "The peacocks are sacred to Hera; and perhaps Samos may be the place where they were first produced and reared, and from thence it was that they were scattered abroad over foreign countries, in the same way as cocks were originally produced in Persia, and the birds called guinea-fowl (???????????) in Aetolia." On which account Antiphanes, in his Brothers by the same Father, says- 
  They say that in the city of Heliopolis 
  The phoenix is produced; the owl in Athens; 
  Cyprus breeds doves of admirable beauty: 
  But Hera, queen of Samos, does, they say, 
  Rear there a golden race of wondrous birds, 
  The brilliant, beautiful, conspicuous peacock.

On which account the peacock occurs on the coins of the Samians.

[71.] G   But since Menodotus has mentioned the guinea-fowl, we ourselves also will say something on that subject. Clytus the Milesian, a pupil of Aristotle, in the first book of his History of Miletus, writes thus concerning them- "All around the temple of the Virgin Goddess at Leros, there are birds called guinea-fowls (???????????). And the ground where they are bred is marshy. And this bird is very devoid of affection towards its young, and wholly disregards its offspring, so that the priests are forced to take care of them. And it is about the size of a very fine fowl of the common poultry, its head is small in proportion to its body, having but few feathers, but on the top it has a fleshy crest, hard and round, sticking up above the head like a peg, and of a woody colour. And over the jaws, instead of a beard, they have a long piece of flesh, beginning at the mouth, redder than that of the common poultry; but of that which exists in the common poultry on the top of the beak, which some people call the beard, they are wholly destitute; so that their beak is mutilated in this respect. But its beak is sharper and larger than that of the common fowl; its neck is black, thicker and shorter than that of common poultry. And its whole body is spotted all over, the general colour being black, studded in every part with thick white spots something larger than lentil seeds. And these spots are ring-shaped, in the middle of patches of a darker hue than the rest of the plumage: so that these patches present a variegated kind of appearance, the black part having a sort of white tinge, and the white seeming a good deal darkened. And their wings are all over variegated with white, in serrated, wavy lines, parallel to each other. And their legs are destitute of spurs like those of the common hen. And the females are very like the males, on which account the sex of the guinea-fowls is hard to distinguish." Now this is the account given of guinea-fowls by the Peripatetic philosopher.

[72.] G   Roasted sucking-pigs are a dish mentioned by Epicrates in his Merchant- 
  On this condition I will be the cook; 
  Nor shall all Sicily boast that even she 
  Produced so great an artist as to fish, 
  Nor Elis either, where I've seen the flesh 
  Of dainty sucking-pigs well brown'd before 
  A rapid fire.

And Alexis, in his Wicked Woman, says- 
  A delicate slice of tender sucking-pig, 
  Bought for three obols, hot, and very juicy, 
  [656] When it is set before us.

"But the Athenians," as Philochorus tells us [ Fr_173 ], " when they sacrifice to the Seasons, do not roast, but boil their meat, entreating the goddesses to defend them from all excessive droughts and heats, and to give increase to their crops by means of moderate warmth and seasonable rains. For they argue that roasting is a kind of cookery which does less good to the meat, while boiling not only removes all its rawness, but has the power also of softening the hard parts, and of making all the rest digestible. And it makes the food more tender and wholesome, on which account they say also, that when meat has been once boiled, it ought not to be warmed up again by either roasting or boiling it; for any second process removes the goodness of it, as Aristotle tells us. And roast meat is more raw and dry than boiled meat." But roast meats are called ????????. Accordingly Strattis in his Callippides says, with reference to Heracles- 
  Immediately he caught up some large slices (????????) 
  Of smoking roasted boar, and swallowed them.

And Archippus, in his Heracles Marrying, says- 
  The trotters of little pigs, well cooked 
  In various fashion; slices, too, of bulls 
  With sharpened horns, and great long steaks of boar, 
  All roasted (????????).

[15.] G   [673] And the Gods know that I first found all this out in the beautiful city of Alexandria, having got possession of the treatise of Menodotus, in which I showed to many people the passage in Anacreon which is the subject of discussion. But Hephaestion, who is always charging every one else with thefts, took this solution of mine, and claimed it as his own, and published an essay, to which he gave this title, Concerning the Garland of Withes mentioned by Anacreon. And a copy of this essay we lately found at Rome in the possession of the antiquary Demetrius. And this compiler Hephaestion behaved in the same way to our excellent friend Adrastus. For after he had published a treatise in five books, Concerning those Matters in Theophrastus in his books on Manners, which are open to any Dispute, either as to their Facts, or the Style in which they are mentioned; and had added a sixth book Concerning the Disputable Points in the Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle; and in these books had entered into a long dissertation on the mention of Plexippus by Antiphon the tragic poet, and had also said a good deal about Antiphon himself; Hephaestion, I say, appropriated all these books to himself, and wrote another book, Concerning the Mention of Antiphon in the Memorabilia of Xenophon, not having added a single discovery or original observation of his own, any more than he had in the discussion On the Garland of Withes. For the only thing he said that was new, was that Phylarchus, in the seventh book of his Histories [ Fr_14 ], mentioned this story about the withes, [674] and knew nothing of the passage of Nicaenetus, nor of that of Anacreon; and he showed that he differed in some respects from the account that had been given by Menodotus.

But one may explain this fact of the garlands of withes more simply, by saying that Megistes wore a garland of withes because there was a great quantity of those trees in the place where he was feasting; and therefore he used it to bind his temples. For the Lacedaemonians at the festival of the Promachia, wear garlands of reeds, as Sosibius tells us in his treatise On the Sacrificial Festivals at Lacedaemon, where he writes thus: "On this festival the natives of the country all wear garlands of reeds, or tiaras, but the boys who have been brought up in the public discipline follow without any garland at all."

[38.] G   [688] But the choicest unguents are made in particular places, as Apollonius, the follower of Herophilus, says in his treatise On Perfumes, where he writes- "The iris is best in Elis, and at Cyzicus; the perfume made from roses is most excellent at Phaselis, and that made at Neapolis and Capua is also very fine. That made from crocuses is in the highest perfection at Soli in Cilicia, and at Rhodes. The essence of spikenard is best at Tarsus; and the extract of vine-leaves is made best in Cyprus and at Adramyttium. The best perfume from marjoram and from apples comes from Cos.  Egypt bears the palm for its essence of henna; and the next best is the Cyprian, and Phoenician, and after them comes the Sidonian. The perfume called Panathenaicum is made at Athens; and those called Metopian and Mendesian are prepared with the greatest skill in Egypt. But the Metopian is made of oil which is extracted from bitter almonds. Still, the superior excellence of each perfume is owing to the purveyors and the materials and the artists, and not to the place itself; [689] for Ephesus formerly, as men say, had a high reputation for the excellence of its perfumes, and especially of its megalleium, but now it has none. At one time, too, the unguents made in Alexandria were brought to high perfection, on account of the wealth of the city, and the attention that Arsinoe and Berenice paid to such matters; and the finest extract of roses in the world was made at Cyrene while the great Berenice was alive. Again, in ancient times, the extract of vine-leaves made at Adramyttium was but poor; but afterwards it became first-rate, owing to Stratonice, the wife of Eumenes. Formerly, too, Syria used to make every sort of unguent admirably, especially that extracted from fenugreek; but the case is quite altered now. And long ago there used to be a most delicious unguent extracted from frankincense at Pergamum, owing to the invention of a certain perfumer of that city, for no one else had ever made it before him; but now none is made there. Now, when a valuable unguent is poured on the top of one that is inferior, it remains on the surface; but when good honey is poured on the top of that which is inferior, it works its way to the bottom, for it compels that which is worse to rise above it."

  * * * * *

[46.] G   [692] But when I was reading the twenty-eighth book of the History of Poseidonius [ Fr_20 ], I observed, my friends, a very pleasant thing which was said about unguents, and which is not at all foreign to our present discussion. For the philosopher says- "In Syria, at the royal banquets, when the garlands are given to the guests, some slaves come in, with little pouches full of Babylonian perfumes, and going round the room at a little distance from the guests, they bedew their garlands with the perfumes, sprinkling nothing else." And since the discussion has brought us to this point, I will add "A verse to Love", as the bard of Cythera [Philoxenus] says, telling you that Janus, who is worshipped as a great god by us, and whom we call Janus the Father, was the original inventor of garlands. And Dracon of Corcyra tells us this in his treatise On Precious Stones, where his words are- "But it is said that Janus had two faces, the one looking forwards and the other backwards; and that it is from him that the mountain Janus and the river Janus are both named, because he used to live on the mountain. And they say that he was the first inventor of garlands, and boats, and ships; and was also the first person who coined brazen money. And on this account many cities in Greece, and many in Italy and Sicily, place on their coins a head with two faces, and on the obverse a boat, or a garland, or a ship. And they say that he married his sister Camese, and had a son named Aethex, and a daughter Olistene. And he, aiming at a more extended power and renown, sailed over to Italy, and settled on a mountain near Rome, which was called Janiculum from his name."

[47.] G   This, now, is what was said about perfumes and unguents. And after this most of them asked for wine, some demanding the cup of the Good Deity, some that of Zeus the Saviour, others that of Hygieia, as different people invoked different deities; and so they all fell to quoting the words of those poets who had mentioned libations to these different deities; and I will now recapitulate what they said, for they quoted Antiphanes, who, in his Farmers' Wives, says- 
  Harmodius was invoked, the paean sung, 
  Each drank a mighty cup to Zeus the Saviour.

And Alexis, in his Usurer, or The Liar, says 
  [693] (A)   Fill now the cup with the libation due 
  To Zeus the Saviour; for he surely is 
  Of all the gods most useful to mankind. 
  (B)   Your Zeus the Saviour, if I were to burst, 
  Would nothing do for me. 
  (A)   Just drink, and trust him.

And Nicostratus, in his Pandrosus, says- 
  (A)   And so I will, my dear; 
  But fill him now a parting cup to Hygieia; 
  (B)   Here, pour a due libation out to Hygieia. 
  (A)   Another to Good Fortune. Fortune manages 
  All the affairs of men; but as for Prudence,- 
  That is a blind irregular deity.

And in the same play he mentions mixing a cup in honour of the Good Deity, as do nearly all the poets of the old comedy; but Nicostratus speaks thus-
  Fill a cup quickly now to the Good Deity, 
  And take away this table from before me; 
  For I have eaten quite enough;- I pledge 
  This cup to the Good Deity;- here, quick, I say, 
  And take away this table from before me.

Xenarchus, too, in his Twins, says- 
  (A)   And now I do begin to nod my head. 
  (B)   The cup to the Good Deity, 
  When I had drained it, knocked me over. 
  (A)   And then the next libation duly quaffed 
  To Zeus the Saviour, wholly wrecked my boat, 
  And overwhelmed me, as you see.

And Eriphus, in his Meliboea, says- 
  Before he'd drunk a cup to the Good Deity, 
  Or to great Zeus the Saviour.

[48.] G   And Theophrastus, in his essay On Drunkenness, says- "The unmixed wine which is given at a banquet, which they call the pledge-cup in honour of the Good Deity, they offer in small quantities, as if reminding the guests of its strength, and of the liberality of the god, by the mere taste. And they hand it round when men are already full, in order that there may be as little as possible drunk out of it. And having paid adoration three times, they take it from the table, as if they were entreating of the gods that nothing may be done unbecomingly, and that they may not indulge in immoderate desires for this kind of drink, and that they may derive only what is honourable and useful from it." And Philochorus, in the second book of his Atthis [ Fr_5 ], says- "And a law was made at that time, that after the solid food is removed, a taste of the unmixed wine should be served round as a sort of sample of the power of the Good Deity, but that all the rest of the wine should be previously mixed; on which account the Nymphs had the name given them of Nurses of Dionysus." And that when the pledge-cup to the Good Deity was handed round, it was customary to remove the tables, is made plain by the wicked action of Dionysius the tyrant of Sicily. For there was a table of gold placed before the statue of Asclepius at Syracuse; and so Dionysius, standing before it, and drinking a pledge-cup to the Good Deity, ordered the table to be removed.

But among the Greeks, those who sacrifice to the Sun, as Phylarchus tells us in the twelfth book of his History [ Fr_25 ], make their libations of honey, as they never bring wine to the altars; saying that it is proper that the god who keeps the whole universe in order, and regulates everything, and is always going round and superintending the whole, should in no respect be connected with drunkenness.

[49.] G   Most writers have mentioned the Attic scolia; and they are worthy also of being mentioned by me to you, on account of the antiquity and simple style of composition of the authors, and of those especially who gained a high reputation for that form of poetry, Alcaeus and Anacreon; [694] as Aristophanes says in his Daitaleis, where we find this line- 
  Come, then, a scolium sing to me, 
  Of old Alcaeus or Anacreon.

Praxilla, the Sicyonian poetess, was also celebrated for the composition of scolia. Now they are called scolia, not because of the character of the verse in which they are written, as if it were ??????? (crooked); for men call also those poems written in a laxer kind of metre ??????. But, "as there are three kinds of songs" (as Artemon of Cassandreia says in the second book of his treatise On the Use of Books), "one or other of which comprehends everything which is sung at banquets; the first kind is that which it was usual for the whole party to sing; the second is that which the whole party indeed sang, not, however, together, but going round according to some kind of succession; the third is that which is ranked lowest of all, which was not sung by all the guests, but only by those who seemed to understand what was to be done, wherever they might happen to be sitting; on which account, as having some irregularity in it beyond what the other kinds had, in not being sung by all the guests, either together or in any definite kind of succession, but just as it might happen, it was called the crooked song (???????). And songs of this kind were sung when the ordinary songs, and those in which every one was bound to join, had come to an end. For then they invited all the more intelligent of the guests to sing some song worth listening to. And what they thought worth listening to were such songs as contained some exhortations and sentiments which seemed useful for the purposes of life."

[50.] G   And of these Deipnosophists, one quoted one scolium, and one another. And these were those which were recited-

I 
  O Tritonian Pallas, who from heaven above 
  Looks with protecting eye 
  On this holy city and land, 
  Deign our protectress now to prove 
  From loss in war, from dread sedition's band, 
  And death's untimely blow, you and your father too.

II 
  I sing at this glad season, of the Queen, 
  Mother of Plutus, Olympian Demeter; 
  May you be ever near us, 
  With Persephone daughter of Zeus, 
  And ever as a friend 
  This citadel defend.

III 
  Leto once in Delos, as they say, 
  Did two great children bear, 
  Apollo with the golden hair, 
  Bright Phoebus, god of day. 
  And Artemis, mighty huntress, virgin chaste. 
  On whom all women's trust is placed.

IV 
  Raise the loud shout to Pan, Arcadia's king; 
  Praise to the Nymphs' loved comrade sing! 
  Come, O Pan, and raise with me 
  The song in joyful ecstasy.

V 
  We have conquered as we would, 
  The gods reward us as they should, 
  And victory bring from Pandrosus (?) to Athene.

VI 
  Oh, would the gods such grace bestow, 
  That opening each man's breast, 
  One might survey his heart, and know 
  How true the friendship that could stand that test.

VII 
  Health's the best gift to mortal given; 
  Beauty is next; the third great prize 
  Is to grow rich, free both from sin and vice; 
  The fourth, to pass one's youth with friends beloved by heaven.

And when this had been sung, and everybody had been delighted with it; and when it had been mentioned that even the incomparable Plato had spoken of this scolium as one most admirably written, Myrtilus said, that Anaxandrides the comic poet had turned it into ridicule in his Treasure, speaking thus of it- 
  The man who wrote this song, whoever he was, 
  When he called health the best of all possessions, 
  Spoke well enough. But when the second place 
  He gave to beauty, and the third to riches, 
  He certainly was downright mad; for surely 
  Riches must be the next best thing to health, 
  For who would care to be a starving beauty!

[695] After that, these other scolia were sung-

VIII 
  'Tis well to stand upon the shore, 
  And look on others on the sea; 
  But when you once have dipped your oar, 
  By the present wind you must guided be.

IX 
  A crab caught a snake in his claw, 
  And thus he triumphantly spake,- 
  "My friends must be guided by law, 
  Nor love crooked counsels to take."

X 
  I'll wreathe my sword in myrtle bough, 
  As Harmodius and Aristogeiton did, 
  When they laid the tyrant low, 
  And to Athens gave equality.

XI 
  Harmodius, hail! you did not die, 
  But stay in the islands of the blest, 
  Where swift-footed Achilles lives, 
  And Diomedes, Tydeus' brave son.

XII 
  I'll wreathe my sword in myrtle bough, 
  As Harmodius and Aristogeiton did, 
  When at Athene's feast they slew 
  Hipparchus, the tyrant of the land.

XIII 
  Harmodius and Aristogeiton, hail! 
  You will have eternal glory; 
  Because you laid the tyrant low, 
  And to Athens gave equality.

XIV 
  Learn, my friend, from Admetus' story, 
  All worthy friends and brave to cherish; 
  But cowards shun when danger comes, 
  For they will leave you alone to perish.

XV 
  Ajax of the ponderous spear, mighty son of Telamon, 
  They call you bravest of the Greeks, next to the great Achilles.

XVI 
  Telamon was first, and Ajax came in second place 
  Of all the Greeks who went to Troy, after invincible Achilles.

XVII 
  Would that I were an fine ivory lyre, 
  Struck by fair boys in Dionysus' chorus.

XVIII 
  Would that I were a golden trinket, large and new, 
  Worn by a lady fair, of spirit chaste.

XIX 
  Drink with me, and sport with me, 
  Love with me, wear crowns with me, 
  Be mad with me when I am moved with rage, 
  And modest when I yield to counsels sage.

XX 
  A scorpion beneath every stone doth lie, 
  And secrets usually hide treachery.

XXI 
  A sow one acorn has, and wants the other; 
  And I have one fair maid, and seek another.

XXII 
  A wanton and a bath-keeper both cherish the same fashion, 
  Giving the worthless and the good the self-same bath to wash in.

XXIII 
  Give Cedon wine, O slave, and fill it up, 
  If you must give each worthy man a cup.

XXIV 
  Alas ! Leipsydrium, you betray 
  A host of gallant men, 
  Who for their country many a day 
  Have fought, and would again. 
  And even when they fell, their race 
  In their great actions you may trace.

XXV 
  The man who never will betray his friend, 
  Earns fame of which nor earth nor heaven shall see the end.

Some also say the poem that which was composed by Hybrias the Cretan is a scolium ; and it runs thus-

XXVI 
  I have great wealth, a sword, and spear, 
  And trusty shield beside me here; 
  [696] With these I plough, and from the vine 
  Squeeze out the heart-delighting wine; 
  They make me lord of everything. 
  But they who dread the sword and spear, 
  And ever trusty shield to bear, 
  Shall fall before me on their knees, 
  And worship me whenever I please, 
  And call me mighty lord and king.

[51.] G   After this, Democritus said:- But the song which was composed by that most learned writer, Aristotle, and addressed to Hermeias of Atarneus, is not a paean, as was asserted by Demophilus, who instituted a prosecution against the philosopher, on the ground of impiety (having been suborned to act the part of accuser by Eurymedon, who was ashamed to appear himself in the business). And he rested the charge of impiety on the fact of his having been accustomed to sing at banquets a paean addressed to Hermeias. But that this song has no characteristic whatever of a paean, but is a kind of scolium, I will show you plainly from its own language- 
  O virtue, never but by labour to be won, 
  First object of all human life, 
  For such a prize as you 
  There is no toil, there is no strife, 
  Nor even death which any Greek would shun; 
  Such is the reward fair and free, 
  And lasting too, with which thou dost thy followers grace,- 
  Better than gold, 
  Better than sleep, or even the glories old 
  Of high descent and noble race. 
  For you Zeus' mighty son, great Heracles, 
  Forsook a life of ease; 
  For you the Spartan brothers twain 
  Sought toil and danger, following your behests 
  With fearless and unwearied breasts. 
  Your love it was that fired and gave 
  To early grave 
  Achilles and the giant son 
  Of Salaminian Telamon. 
  And now for you Atarneus' pride, 
  Trusting in others' faith, has nobly died; 
  But yet his name 
  Shall never die, the Muses' holy train 
  Shall bear him to the skies with deathless fame, 
  Honouring Zeus, the hospitable god, 
  And honest hearts, proved friendship's blest abode.

[52.] G   Now I don't know whether any one can detect in this any resemblance to a paean, when the author expressly states in it that Hermeias is dead, when he says- 
  And now for you Atarneus' pride, 
  Trusting in others' faith, has nobly died.

Nor has the song the refrain, which all paeans have, of "Io Paean", as that song written on Lysander the Spartan, which really is a paean, has; a song which Duris, in his book entitled The Annals of the Samians, says is sung in Samos. That also was a paean which was written in honour of Craterus the Macedonian, of which Alexinus the dialectician was the author, as Hermippus the pupil of Callimachus says in the first book of his essay on Aristotle. And this song is sung at Delphi, with a boy playing the lyre as an accompaniment to it. The song, too, addressed to Agemon of Corinth, the father of Alcyone, which the Corinthians sang, contains the refrain of the paean. And this refrain, too, is even added by Polemon Periegetes to his letter addressed to Aranthius. The song also which the Rhodians sing, addressed to Ptolemy the first king of Egypt, is a paean: for it contains the refrain "Io Paean", [697] as (?) Gorgon tells us in his essay On the Sacrifices at Rhodes.  # And Philochorus says that the Athenians sing paeans in honour of Antigonus and Demetrius, which were composed by Hermippus of Cyzicus, on an occasion when a great many poets had a contest as to who could compose the finest paean, and the victory was adjudged to Hermippus. And, indeed, Aristotle himself, in his Defence of himself from the accusation of impiety, (unless the speech is a spurious one,) says- "For if I had wished to offer sacrifice to Hermeias as an immortal being, I should never have built him a tomb as a mortal; nor if I had wished to make him out to be a god, should I have honoured him with funeral obsequies like a man."

[53.] G   When Democritus had said this, Cynulcus said;- Why do you remind me of those cyclic poems, to use the words of your friend Philon, when you never ought to say anything serious or important in the presence of this glutton Ulpianus? For he prefers lascivious songs to dignified ones; such, for instance, as those which are called Locrian songs, which are of a debauched sort of character, such as- 
  Do you not feel some pleasure now? 
  Do not betray me, I entreat you. 
  Rise up before my husband comes back, 
  Lest he should ill-treat you and me. 
  'Tis morning now, do you not see 
  The daylight through the windows?

And all Phoenicia is full of songs of this kind; and he himself, when there, used to go about playing on the flute with the men who sing the so-called pig-songs (????????). And there is good authority, Ulpianus, for this word. For Demetrius of Scepsis, in the tenth book of his Trojan Array, speaks thus:- "Ctesiphon the Athenian, who was a composer of the so-called pig-songs (????????), was made by Attalus, who succeeded Philetaerus as king of Pergamum, judge of all his subjects in the district of Aeolis." And the same writer, in the nineteenth book of the same work, says that Seleucus the composer of merry songs was the son of Mnesiptolemus, who was an historian, and who had great influence with that Antiochus who was called the Great. And it was very much the fashion to sing this song of his- 
  I will choose a boy-loving life, 
  That is far better than a wife; 
  Boy-friends in war a man stand by, 
  While the wife goes home to cry.

  * * * * *

[62.] G     [701] Then, when many of the guests cried out i? pai?n, Pontianus said:- I wish, my friends, to learn from you whether i? pai?n is a proverb, or the burden of a song, or what else it is. And Democritus replied:- Clearchus of Soli, inferior to none of the pupils of the wise Aristotle, in the first book of his treatise on Proverbs, says: "Leto, when she was taking Apollo and Artemis from Chalcis in Euboea to Delphi, came to the cave which was called the cave of the Python. And when the Python attacked them, Leto, holding one of her children in her arms, got upon the stone which even now lies at the foot of the brazen statue of Leto, which is dedicated as a representation of what then took place near the Plane-tree at Delphi, and cried out ?? ??? (and Apollo happened to have his bow in hand); and this is the same as if she had said ???? ??? or ???? ??? - Shoot, boy. And from this day hie pai and hie pai?n arose. But some people, slightly altering the word, use it as a sort of proverbial exclamation,, to avert evils, and say i? pai?n instead of hie pai?n. And many also, when they have completed any undertaking, say, as a sort of proverb, i? pai?n ; but since it is an expression that is familiar to us it is forgotten that it is a proverb, and they who use it are not aware that they are uttering a proverb." But as for what Heracleides of Pontus says, that is clearly a mistake, that "the god himself, while offering a libation, thrice cried out i? paian, i? paian, i? paian." From a belief in this statement he refers the trimeter verse, as it is called, to the god, saying that "each of these metres belongs to the god; because when the first two syllables are made long, ?? paian, it becomes a heroic verse, but when they are pronounced short it is an iambic, and thus it is plain that we must also attribute the limping iambic { choliamb } to him. For if (the first syllable in each measure being considered short) one prolongs the last two syllables of all, the verse will belong to the type represented by Hipponax."

[63.] G   And after this, when we also were about to leave the party, the slaves came in bringing, one an incense burner, and another . . . Then Larensis prayed to all the gods and goddesses; he then made libation of wine, and after giving, according to the custom of the place, the remainder of the unmixed wine to the slave who had served it to drink up, he sang the following paean to Hygieia {"Health"}, [702] composed by Ariphron of Sicyon :- 
  Hygieia, most revered of the blessed gods, 
  May I dwell with you for the rest of my life, 
  And may you be the gracious inmate of my house. 
  For if there is any delight in wealth or in offspring, 
  Or in royal dominion which makes men equal to gods, or in those desires 
  Which we seek to capture by Aphrodite's hidden nets, 
  Or if any other joy or rest from toil has been revealed to men by the gods, 
  It is with your help, blessed Hygieia, 
  That they all flourish and shine in the Graces' discourse; 
  But without you, no man is happy.

[64.] G   . . . the ancients know. For Sopater the farce-writer, in his play entitled The Lentil, speaks thus :- 
  I can both carve and drink Etruscan wine, 
  In due proportion mixed.

These things, my good Timocrates, are not, as Plato says, the sportive conversations of Socrates in his youth and beauty, but the serious discussions of the Deipnosophists; for, as Dionysius Chalcus {"the Brazen"} says :- 
  What, whether you begin or end a work, 
  Is better than the thing you most require ?

{ Here ends the 15th and last book of the Deipnosophists of Athenaeus. }
