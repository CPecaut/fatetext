AlreadyTo ease your concerns, which may yet be justified,I've rounded the two seas Corinth's heights divide:				      10I sought Theseus among those by the roadstead,Where Acheron's seen to flow towards the dead:I visited Elis, and on leaving Taenarus,Sailed the waves that saw the fall of Icarus.What gives you fresh hope, in what happy depths				      15Do you think to discover traces of his steps?Who even knows if the king your father, wouldWish the mystery of his absence understood?Or if, though like you we've trembled for his safety,The hero, hiding some new love affair, may be				      20Merely waiting till his betrayed lover, as yet....HippolyteStop, dear Theramenes, show Theseus some respect.Free of his youthful errors now, returning,No unworthy obstacle would there delay him:Ending his fatal inconstancy by her prayers,					      25Phaedra no longer has any such rival to fear.Yet, seeking him I'll go and fulfil my duty,Leaving these shores I no longer wish to see. TheramenesMy lord, since when did you fear the proximity,Of peaceful scenes, so dear to you from infancy,				      30Whose haunts I've often seen you prefer beforeThe tumultuous pomp of Athens and her court?What risk, or rather what sorrow, drives you away?HippolyteGlad times are no more. All's changed since the dayThat, to our shores, the gods despatched the daughter,			      35Of Minos King of Crete: Pasiphae her mother.TheramenesI see. The reason for your pain is known to me.Phaedra, grieves you, here, offends you deeply.A dangerous stepmother, who scarcely saw youBefore she signalled her wish to banish you.				     	      40But the hatred that she then turned your wayHas either lessened, now, or seeped away.And what danger can she offer you, besides:A dying woman: and one who seeks to die?Phaedra, touched by illness her silence covers,				      45Tired at last of herself, and the light around her,What designs could she intend against you?HippolyteHer fruitless enmity's not what I have in view.Hippolyte, in leaving, flees someone other.I flee, I confess, from young Aricia,						      50Last of a deadly race that conspires against me.TheramenesWhat! Are you persecuting her, my lord, indeed?Has that sweet sister of the cruel PallantidesEver been involved in her brothers' perfidies?Can you bring yourself to hate her innocent charms?			      55HippolyteIf I hated her I would not flee her arms.TheramenesAm I allowed to explain this flight to us?Can it be you're no longer proud Hippolytus,Implacable enemy of the laws of love,Of that yoke Theseus so often knew above?				                60Could Venus whom your pride so often scorned,Wish to justify Theseus, after all?And placing you in the ranks of other mortals,Force you now to light incense at her altars?Do you love, my lord?Hippolytus		       Friend, what is it you dare say?			                65You who've known my heart since my first day,Do you ask me to deny, when it would be shameful,The feelings of a heart so proud, and so disdainful?With her milk, an Amazon mother once fed meOn that pride you seem, now, so amazed to see:				      70Then, when I myself achieved a riper age,I knew and approved my thoughts at every stage.Attached to me then, with eager sincerity,You told me all about my father's history.You know how my soul, attentive to your voice,				      75Was warmed by the noble story of his exploits,As you revealed that intrepid hero to me,Consoling us mortals for lost Hercules,Monsters choked, and robbers punished,Procustus, Cercyon, Sciron, and Sinis: 	      				      80Epidaurus, and the giant's bones flung abroad, Crete, smoking with the blood of the Minotaur.But when you told me of less glorious deeds,His word in a hundred places pledged, received,Helen in Sparta stolen from her parents,					      85Periboea's tears witnessed by all Salamis,So many others whose names he's forgotten,Credulous spirits deceived by his passion:Ariadne telling the rocks of those injustices,Phaedra won, at last, under better auspices:					      90You know how, regretfully hearing that discourse,I often urged you to abridge its course:Happy if I could erase in memoryThe unworthy chapters of so fine a story!And am I myself entangled in my turn?					      95Is my humiliation the gods concern?My cowardly sighs are the more contemptible,Since glory renders Theseus excusable:Because as yet myself I've tamed no monsters,I've acquired no right to imitate his failures.					    100And even if my pride could be sweetened more,Would I choose Aricia as my conqueror?Is my mind so lost it no longer remembersThe eternal obstacle that separates us?My father disapproves: and laws most severe				    105Prevent him granting nephews to her brothers:He fears the offspring born of a guilty strain:He'd like to bury their sister and their name,Submit her to his guardianship till the grave,Ensure that for her no wedding torches blaze.				    110 Should I flaunt her rights against an angry father?Shall I set an example in my rashness, rather?And let my youth embark on a mad affair...TheramenesOh! My lord, once our fate is written there,Heaven knows not to inquire into our reasons.				    115Theseus opened your eyes so he might close them,Yet his hatred, exciting a rebellious flame,Lends new grace to his enemy all the same.Why be frightened of a love, though, that's so chaste?If it possesses sweetness, won't you dare to taste?				    120Will these awkward scruples always hold you back?Do you fear to lose yourself on Hercules' track?Of what brave men has Venus not been conqueror!Where would you be, now, you who fight against her,If Antiope, opposed to her laws forever,					    125Hadn't burnt for Theseus with modest ardour?But what use is it to affect a proud display?Confess, and all will change: for many a dayWe've seen you infrequently, unsociable, proud,Now driving your chariot along the coast road,				   130Now, skilled in the art Neptune himself made plain,Breaking an untamed stallion to the rein.The forests ring out less often to our cries.Filled with secret fire, there's heaviness in your eyes.There's no longer any doubt: you love, you burn:				    135You are dying of an illness you disguise in turn.Or has lovely Aricia pleased you, rather?HippolytusTheramenes, I am leaving, to seek my father.TheramenesWill you not see Phaedra again, before you go,My lord?Hippolytus	     That's my intent: you may tell her so.				    140I'll see her, since my duty demands of it me.(Oenone enters.)But what new trouble disturbs dear Oenone? Act I Scene II (Hippolytus, Oenone, Theramenes)OenoneAlas! My lord, what misfortune could equal mine?The Queen is near to the ending of her life.I've kept watch over her, in vain, day and night:				    145She'll die in my arms of this illness that she hides.Eternal disorder reigns now in her spirit.She's torn from her bed by sorrowful unquiet.She wishes to see the light: yet with deep sadnessOrders the world outside to be dismissed...				    	    150She is here.Hippolyte	 Enough: I'll leave this place to her,And show my odious face to her no longer. Act I Scene III (Phaedra, Oenone)PhaedraLet's go no further. Stay, dear Oenone.I can't support myself: my strength has left me.My eyes are dazzled, on seeing the light of day,				    155My knees, trembling beneath me, have given way.Alas!(She sits down.)OenoneAll-powerful gods! If tears could but appease.PhaedraHow these vain ornaments, these veils burden me!What irksome hand, weaving these knots around,Has gathered my hair with such care on my brow?				   160All afflicts, and harms, and conspires to harm me.OeneoneYour wishes thwart one another, alternately!You yourself, condemning your unjust intent,Urged our hands to prepare you for this instant:You yourself, recalling your former strength,				   165Wished to rise again, and see the light at length.You see it, mistress, and start to hide once more:Do you hate the daylight you were searching for?PhaedraNoble, glittering creator of a sad family,You, whose daughter my mother dared claim to be,				   170Who blush perhaps on viewing my troubled mind, Oh Sun, I come to look on you for one last time.OeneoneWhat! Will you never forget that cruel desire?Am I always to see you renouncing life entire,Making funereal preparations for your death?				    175PhaedraGods! Why am I not sitting in that dark forest?When shall I follow the chariot with my eyesCharging nobly on, through the dust that flies?OenoneWhat, lady?Phaedra      Maddened, where am I! What did I say?Where have I let my will and spirit go play?				              180I have lost them: the gods deny me their use.Oenone, blushes cover my face, its truth:I have let you see my sad shame too clearly,And my eyes, despite myself, weep tearfully.OenoneOh! If you must blush, blush for your silence				    185That still embitters your sorrow's violence.Rebelling against our care, deaf to our discourse,Will you let your last days take this pitiless course? What madness limits them in the midst of their force?What spell, what poison has dried up their source?			   	    190	Three times the shadows have obscured the sky,Since sleep has entered in your saddened eye:Three times has day driven night from the firmament,While your body languished without nourishment.By what fearful design are you being tempted?				    195By what right do you dare to let your life be ended?You offend the gods, creators of your reality:You betray the man to whom you pledged all loyalty:You betray your children, those unfortunates,Whom you drive beneath the yoke's harsh weight. 				    200Think how that day will snatch away their mother,And give hope to the son of that alien other,To that proud enemy of yours, your race's doom,That son an Amazon carried in her womb,That Hippolytus...PhaedraGods! Oenone			        You're moved by my censure?			    205PhaedraWretched woman, whose name do you dare to mention?OenoneThat's good! Your anger rises for a reason:I'm glad to see you shudder at her fatal son.Live then. As love and duty shall drive you on,Live, and don't allow that child of a Scythian,				    210Crushing your children in despised embrace,To command the gods' and Greece's noblest race.But don't delay: each moment now is killing you.Quickly then, your waning strength needs rescue,While the flame of your life, almost dwindled,				    215Still endures, and can even yet be rekindled.PhaedraI've already prolonged its guilty thread too far. OenoneHow! By what remorse are you being torn apart?What crime could have brought about such fierce pain?Your hands have no innocent blood on them, no stain?			    220PhaedraThanks to heaven, my hands are not criminals.Would the gods my heart were innocent as well!OenoneAnd what fearful project have you tried,That it still leaves your heart so terrified?PhaedraI've talked to you enough. Now, spare me the rest.				    225I die to evade this disastrous urge to confess.OenoneWell die: and so protect that inhuman silence:But seek another hand to close your eyes, andThough scarcely a feeble ray of light is left you,My spirit will descend to the dead before you.				    230A thousand roads ever open lead us on,And my true grief will choose the shortest one.Cruel one, when has my faith ever betrayed you?Think: when you were born my arms received you.For you, I left everything, my land: my children.				    235Is this the reward that loyalty shall be given?PhaedraWhat benefit do you hope for from this violence?You'll shudder with horror if I break my silence. OenoneGreat gods, what could you tell me that wouldn't yieldTo the horror of seeing you die, my eyes unsealed?			   	    240PhaedraIf you knew my crime, my fate that crushes the will,I would die no less: I would die more guilty still.OenoneMadame, by the tears for you that wet my face,By your faltering knees that I here embrace,Free my spirit from dreadful questioning.					    245PhaedraYou wish it so. Rise. Oenone			 Speak: I am listening.PhaedraHeaven! What shall I tell her? Begin, but where?OenoneDon't offend me with these idle hints of terror.PhaedraO Venus' hatred! O fatal anger!To what distraction did love not drive my mother!				    250 OenoneForget those things, and in future, my lady, Let eternal silence hide their memory. PhaedraAriadne, my sister! Wounded by what passionDid you die on the shore, where you were abandoned?OenoneWhy this, my lady? What mortal misery					    255Excites you today against your family?PhaedraBecause Venus wills that of this dreadful raceI shall perish the last, and the most disgraced.OenoneDo you love?Phaedra		I feel all the furies of desire.OenoneFor whom?Phaedra		You shall know all my deepest fire.				    260I love....At the deadly name I tremble, shudder.I love.... OenoneWhom? Phaedra		                 The son of that Amazon mother:You must know that prince I myself oppressed so long?OenoneHippolyte! You gods!Phaedra			   Yes, him, you are not wrong.OenoneJust heaven! All the blood's frozen in my veins.				    265O despair! O crime! O you race without shame!Unfortunate voyage! O, miserable shore!Why did you come then to this place of danger?PhaedraMy pain goes further back. I was scarcely tiedTo Aegeus' son, by those laws that make a bride,			    	    270My false peace and happiness secured to me,When Athens showed me my glorious enemy.I saw him, I blushed: I paled at the sight:Pain swelled in my troubled heart outright:My eyes saw nothing: I couldn't speak for pain:				    275I felt my whole body frozen, and in flame.I recognised Venus and her fearsome fires.Of a race whose remorseless torments she desires.I thought I could prevent grief by ceaseless prayer:I built her a temple, adorned it with all care:				    	    280Surrounding myself with victims at all hours,I sought my lost reason in those bloody dowers,The powerless remedy for a love without a cure!In vain I burnt incense at her altars, impure:When my mouth called on the name of the goddess,			    285I adored Hippolytus: my vision of him endless,Even at the altars' foot where I lit the flame,I offered all to that god I dared not name.I avoided him everywhere. O height of misery!My eyes sought him in his father's reality.				    	    290At last I dared to rise against my own being:I roused my courage to persecute, with feeling. To banish the enemy who made me an idolater,I feigned my grievance, an unjust stepmother:I urged his exile, and my eternal cries,						    295Made him unwelcome to his father's eyes.I breathed Oenone, then, and given his absenceMy days, less troubled, were spent in innocence.Submitting to my husband, hiding pain instead,Caring for the fruits of our fatal marriage bed.				    300Useless precaution! Cruel destiny!Brought by my husband to Troezen, only to see,Once more, the enemy that I'd sent away:My wound, still living, quickly bled again,It's no longer an ardour hidden in my veins:					    305It's Venus fastening wholly on her prey.For my crime I now conceive a perfect terror:I view my life with hatred, my love with horror.Dying, I wish to protect my name by that act:And conceal from the light a flame so black.					    310I could not endure your tears: your questioning:I've confessed it all: and I repent of nothing,Provided you respect my death's approach,Without afflicting me with unjust reproach,And that you cease to recall by your vain aid,				    315This remnant of life I'm ready to breathe away. Act I Scene IV (Phaedra, Oenone, Panope)PanopeI wished to hide the sorrowful news from you, My lady: but now I must reveal it to you.Death has taken your invincible husband,You only were unaware that it has happened.				    320OenonePanope, what are you saying?Panope				     That the Queen betrayedWould demand Theseus's return from heaven in vain,And that Hippolyte his son has learned of this before,From those vessels that have lately come to shore.Phaedra	You Heavens!	Panope	      Athens is split over the choice of leader.			   	    325One gives his vote to your son the Prince: another,Madame, forgetting the laws of his country,Dares grant support to the son of your enemy.They even say that an insolent intrigue Would crown Aricia and the Pallantides.					    330I thought this peril might be turned from you.Even now Hippolyte prepares to leave us too:And I fear that if he appears, in that storm,The fickle crowd will follow him in swarms. OenonePanope, that's enough. The Queen who's listening,				    335Will not neglect to heed your vital warning. Act I Scene V (Phaedra, Oenone)OenoneMy lady, I'd ceased to urge you to live on:I'd already decided to follow you to the tomb:I had thought to seek to deter you no longer:But this new trouble forces new duties on you.				    340Your fate has altered, and shows another face:The King's no more. Madame must take his place.You belong to your son, left to you by that death,A slave if you die, a king while you have breath.On whom, in this trouble, would you have him depend?			    345His tears will find no hand to dry them, no friend:His innocent cries, heard by the gods above us,Will harm his mother, and anger his ancestors.Live: you've nothing to condemn yourself for there:Your passion becomes a commonplace affair.				    350Theseus, in dying, destroyed those complications,That formed the crime, the horror of your passion.Hippolyte's presence is less fearsome to you now,And you can see him without guilt on your brow. Perhaps, convinced of your profound aversion,				    355He'll make himself the leader of this sedition.Disabuse him of his error: sway his bravery.King of this happy land, Troezen's his destiny:And he knows that the law will grant to your sonThose proud ramparts of Minerva's creation. 				    360Both of you face the same true enemy:Combine: oppose Aricia, in harmony.PhaedraWell! I will let myself be led by your advice.Let us live, if they can bring me back to life,And if love of a son, at this gloomy time,					    365Can re-animate what's left of my feeble mind. Act II Scene I (Aricia, Ismene)AriciaHippolyte wishes to see me here? And why?Hippolyte looks for me, wants to say goodbye?Ismene, is this true? Surely, you're incorrect?IsmeneIt's due to Theseus's death: the first effect.				    	    370My lady, be ready on every side to viewThose Theseus rejected, who'll flock to you.Aricia's finally mistress of her fate,And you'll soon see all Greece is at your feet.AriciaSo it's not, Ismene, some ill-founded rumour?				    375I have no enemies: I'm a slave no longer?IsmeneNo, my lady, the gods no longer oppose it,And Theseus goes to meet your brothers' spirits.AriciaDo they say what action has ended his days?IsmeneUnbelievable tales of his ending circulate					    380They say that the waves have swallowed the faithless:A husband, yet abductor of some fresh mistress.They even say, and this rumour's widely spread,That, with Pirithous, he went down among the dead,Saw the Cocytus, and the shores of darkness,				    385Showed himself alive to infernal shades, no less:But could not escape from that gloomy sojourn,And re-cross the border we pass without return.AriciaAm I to believe a man, prior to his dying breath,Could penetrate to the deep house of the dead?				   390What spell drew him to that formidable shore?IsmeneYou alone doubt, Madame: Theseus is no more:Athens laments it, Troezen knows of it,And has recognised Hippolytus already.Phaedra, in the palace, trembles for her son's life,				    395From all her anxious friends she demands advice.AriciaAnd you think Hippolytus, kinder than his father,Being more humane, will make my chains lighter?That he'll pity my troubles?Ismene				          Madame, I think so.AriciaIs unfeeling Hippolytus known to you though?			    	    400What shallow hope makes you think he'll pity me,And respect a sex he treats disdainfully?You see he's evaded us for some time now,And seeks the places where we never go.IsmeneI know all that they say about his coldness:					    405But I've seen proud Hippolytus in your presence:And, even as I watched, the rumours of his prideRedoubled my curiosity, I find.His reality didn't quite match the rumour:At your first glances I found him someone other.				    410His eyes, that wished in vain to evade you,Already, filled with yearning, could not leave you.A lover's name perhaps would slight his courage:But he has the eyes of one, if not the language.AriciaDear Ismene, my heart hears it so eagerly,					    415Your speech that owes so little to reality!O you who know me does it seem believableThat the sad plaything of a fate so pitiable,A heart fed always on tears and bitterness,Could still know love, and its sad foolishness?				    420Born of a king, a noble prince of this world,I alone escaped the furious wars unfurled.I lost six brothers in the flower of their youth,And the hopes of an illustrious house in truth!The sword took them all: and the clinging mud,				    425Drank with regret Erectheus' nephews' blood.You know, since their death, what law's severityForbade any of those Greeks to sigh for me:They fear lest the sister's reckless passionsWill one day re-animate the brothers' ashes.					    430But you also know with what a scornful airI regarded the suspicious conqueror's care.You know that, ever resistant to all lust,I often gave thanks to Theseus the unjust,Whose fine severity supported my contempt.					    435Yet my eyes, my eyes had not seen his son yet.Not through the eyes alone, shamefully enchanted,Do I love the beauty of him, his grace so vaunted,Gifts with which nature wished to honour him,Which he himself disdains, ignores it seems.				    	    440I love I find, in him, the noblest riches,His father's virtues, and not his weaknesses.I love, I must confess, that generous pride,Which has never bent beneath a yoke of sighs.Phaedra was honoured by Theseus' breath in vain,				    445For myself, I'm prouder, and flee the glory gainedFrom homage offered to hundreds, and so easily,From entering a heart thrown open to so many.But to make an unyielding courage bend,To make that unfeeling heart of his feel pain,				    450To fetter a captive astonished by his chains,Fighting the yoke, that delights him so, in vain:That's what I wish, that is what excites me.To disarm Hippolytus counts for more than Hercules:Often vanquished, and defeated more swiftly,				    455To the eyes that tamed him offering less glory.But, alas, dear Ismene! How daring I am!I'll be blocked indeed by profound resistance.Perhaps you'll hear me, humbled then, in pain,Lamenting that same pride I admire today.					    460Hippolyte might love? By what great happinessMight I have altered...Ismene		You'll hear him, himself, mistress:He is coming to you. Act II Scene II (Hippolytus, Aricia, Ismene)Hippolyte			       Madame, before I leave,I thought to advise you what your fate shall be.My father no longer lives. My true prescience				    465Anticipated the cause of his long absence:Death alone, limiting his brilliant efforts,Could hide him so long from the universe.At last the gods delivered the friend, the comrade,The heir of Hercules to the murderous Fates.				    	    470I imagine your hatred, denying him his virtue,Without regret, hears all those names he's due.Yet one hope now softens my mortal sadness:That I might free you from a guardian's harshness,I revoke laws whose rigour I deplored: you are				    475Free now to dispose of yourself, and your heart:And in this Troezen, now my inheritance,The legacy of my ancestor Pittheus once,Which has made me king, unhesitatingly,I set you free as well, freer than I can be.					    480AriciaModerate your kindness whose excess shames me.By honouring my plight with care, so generously,It binds me, my lord, more than you might see,To those austere laws from which you free me.HippolyteAthens, uncertain of its choice for the succession,				    485Speaks of you, names me, and also the Queen's son.AriciaOf me, my Lord? Hippolyte		      I don't deceive myself: I knowThat its proud laws seem to reject me: even soGreece reproaches me for my foreign mother.But if the only competition were my brother,					    490Madame, over him I have essential claims,That I could salvage from the law's domains.A more legitimate curb arrests my boldness:I cede to you, rather I return a title no less,A sceptre your ancestors long ago received					    495From that famous mortal whom the earth conceived.Adoption placed it in Aegeus' hands, there.Athens, enriched, protected by my father,Recognised, joyfully, a king so generous,And sent your poor brothers to forgetfulness.				    500Athens now calls you back within her walls.She's suffered long enough from those quarrels.Too long has your blood, swallowed by its furrows,Made that earth steam from which it first arose.Troezen obeys me. The countryside of Crete					    505Offers the son of Phaedra a rich retreat.Attica is yours. I leave now, and go tooTo unite all our scattered votes for you.AriciaI'm astonished and confused by all I hear,I fear lest a dream deceives me, yes I fear.					    510Am I awake? Can I believe in such a plan?What god, my Lord, what god guides your hand?How deserved your fame: they speak it everywhere!And how much the truth exceeds what they declare!You would sacrifice yourself in favour of me!				    515Is it not sufficient that you will not hate me?And for so long were able to protect your soulFrom that enmity... Hippolyte		        I hate you, Madame, how so?Despite those colours in which they paint my pride,Can they think a monster brought me to the light?				    520What savage manners, what hardened hatredWould not, on seeing you, be wholly softened?Could I have resisted the seductive charm...AriciaWhat? My Lord.Hippolyte	      I have let myself run on too far.I see my reason has given way to violence.					    525Yet since I've now begun to break my silence,Madame, I will continue: I'll speak againOf a secret my heart can no longer contain.A prince to be pitied is before your eyes,A memorable example of reckless pride.					    530	I who proudly revolted against all passion,Have long scorned the chains of that lovers' prison:As I deplored the shipwrecks of weak men,Thinking that from the shore I'd always view them:Now subjugated to the common law,						    535What turmoil bears me to a distant shore?	One moment conquered boldness so imprudent:My soul, so proud, is finally dependant.For more than six months, desperate, ashamed,Bearing throughout the wound with which I'm maimed,			    540I steeled myself towards you, and myself, in vain:Present, I flee you: absent, I find you again:Your image follows me in the forest's night:The shadows of darkness, and broad daylight,Both bring to my eyes the charms that I avoid,				   545Both snare the rebel Hippolytus on every side.This is the reward for my excessive care: I search for my self: and yet find no one there.My bow, my spears, my chariot all call me.I cannot remember now what Neptune taught me.				    550My cries alone make the woodlands ring,And the idle horses all forget my calling.Perhaps the tale of so wild a love will make youBlush, hearing me, at all your charms could do. What shy entreaty for a heart in your hands!					    555What a strange prisoner for such lovely bonds!But the offering should be dearer to your eyes.I speak to you in a foreign tongue, ah, realise:Do not reject these vows, so poorly expressed,That but for you Hippolytus had not confessed.				    560 Act II Scene III (Hippolytus, Aricia, Theramenes, Ismene)TheramenesThe Queen is here my lord: I've arrived before her.She's seeking you.Hippolytus			Me?Theramenes			        Of her intent I'm unaware,But her messenger came to speak on her behalf.Phaedra wishes to see you before you depart.Hippolytus Phaedra? What might she wish? What will I tell her...		              565AriciaYou cannot refuse, my Lord, to listen to her.Though only too convinced of her enmity,You owe her tears some semblance of pity.HippolytusMeanwhile you leave. And I go not knowingWhether I've offended charms worth adoring.				    570Not knowing if the heart I leave in your hands...AriciaGo, Prince, and pursue your generous plans.Make Athens tributary to my power.I accept all those gifts you make my dower.But that Empire, so grand, so glorious a prize,				    575Is not the dearest gift of all, to my eyes.Act II Scene IV (Hippolytus, Theramenes)HippolytusIs all ready, my friend? But, here is the Queen.Go, so all is prepared now for us to leave.Give the signals, course, orders: then, returning,Free me swiftly from this unfortunate meeting.				    580 Act II Scene V (Phaedra, Hippolytus, Oenone)Phaedra (To Oenone.)He is there. All my blood rises towards my heart.Seeing him, I forget what I came to impart.OenoneRemember your son, whose only hope you are.PhaedraI hear that a swift departure takes you farFrom us, my Lord. I come to join my tears to yours.			    585I come, on my son's behalf, to explain my fears.My son is fatherless: the day's not long distantThat will make him a witness of my final moments.Already thousands attack his vulnerability:You alone can protect him from his enemies.					    590But now a secret regret agitates my mind.I fear I have closed your ears to all his cries.I tremble lest your just anger follow after,Swiftly pursuing in him his hated mother.HippolyteMadame, my feelings are not as base as that.				   	    595PhaedraIf you hated me, I would not complain of it,My Lord. You thought me intent on doing harm:But you could not read the depths of my heart.I took care to expose myself to your hostility:Could not endure your presence in my country.				    600I spoke against you in public, and privately,I wished to be parted from you by the sea:I even declared a law that forbade, expressly,Any man to dare to speak your name to me.Yet if one measures the offence by its pain,					    605If hatred alone inspires hatred again,No woman was ever worthier of pity,And less deserving, my Lord, of your enmity.HippolytusA mother jealous of the rights of her children,Seldom tolerates the son of another husband.					    610I know that, Madame. Constant suspicionIs the most common fruit of a second union.Every other would have taken like offence,And I'd have suffered insults the more intense.PhaedraOh! My Lord, I dare to say here that heaven,					    615In this case, wished to make me an exception!A different matter troubles and consumes me!HippolyteMadame, then you are troubled prematurely.Perhaps your husband still sees the light of day:With his return, heaven might those tears repay.				    620Neptune protects him: my father has neverCalled in vain to his guardian god in prayer.PhaedraWe cannot view the shores of the dead twice, my Lord.  Since Theseus has already seen those sombre shores,The hope some god may send him back to you is vain,			    625And greedy Acheron never lets loose its prey.What do I say? He's not dead: in you he breathes.I always believe I see my husband before me.I see, I speak to him, and my heart...forgive me,My Lord, my fond passion speaks, in spite of me.			    	    630 HippolytusI see the profound effect of your fondness.Dead though he may be, you still see Theseus:Your soul is forever inflamed with love of him.PhaedraYes, Prince, I languish, and I burn for him.I love him, not one whom hell has seen descend,				    635Fickle worshipper of a thousand diverse ends,Who'd dishonour the bed of the god of the dead:But the loyal, proud, even shy man, instead,Charming, young: drawing after him all hearts.Such as one depicts the gods: or as you are.					    640He shares your bearing, your eyes, your speech,That noble modesty that stains his cheeks,As when he sailed across our Cretan watersWorthy to be desired by Minos' daughters.What were you doing then? Why gather the heroes,			    645All the flower of Greece, without Hippolytus? Why could you, still so young, not be aboardThe ships that brought him once to our shores?The Cretan monster would have perished there,At your hand, despite the toils of his vast lair.				    650To disentangle that confusing problem, tooMy sister would have handed you the fatal clew.No! I'd have been before her with that course,Love would have swiftly inspired the thought.I it is, Prince, I whose expert assistance					    655Would have taught you the windings of the Labyrinth.With what care I would have cherished your dear head!Your lover would not have been content with a thread.A companion in the danger you had to go through,I myself would have wished to walk ahead of you:				    660And Phaedra, plunging with you into the Labyrinth,Would have returned with you, or herself have perished. HippolytusYou gods! What do I hear? Madame, do you forgetThat Theseus is my father, your husband yet?PhaedraAnd what makes you think I forget his memory				    665Prince? Have I lost all care for my own glory?HippolytusMadame, forgive me. I blush at my confessionI've wrongly judged an innocent expression.My shame can no longer endure your vision:And I go...PhaedraAh! You've listened too long, cruel one.				    670I've told you enough for you to be undeceived.Well! Contemplate Phaedra then in all her fury.I love. But don't think at the moment of loving youI find myself innocent in my own eyes, or approve, Or that slack complacency has fed the poison,				    675Of this wild passion that troubles all my reason.I, the wretched object of divine vengeance,Loathe myself much more than you ever can.The gods are my witnesses, those gods who placedThe fire in my breast, so fatal to all my race,					    680Those gods whose glory it is, always cruel,To seduce the heart of a weak mortal.You yourself can bring the past the mind, too,It was not enough to avoid you: I exiled you.I wished to seem odious, inhuman to you.					    685I sought your hate, the better to resist you.How have those useless efforts brought success?You hated me more: I did not love you less.Your misfortune even lent you fresh dimension.I languished, withered, in tears, and in passion.				    690You only needed eyes to be persuaded,If your eyes had looked at me, not been dissuaded.What? This confession that I so shamefully,Make to you, do you think it voluntary?Trembling for a son I did not dare betray, 				   	    695To beg you not to hate him I come today.Weak project of a heart too full of what it loves!Alas! It is only yourself I have spoken of.Take vengeance: punish me for loathed delight.Worthy son of a hero who granted you light.					    700Deliver the world from a monster so odious.	Theseus' widow dares to love Hippolytus!This dreadful monster won't escape: believe me.Here's my heart. Here's where your hand should strike me.Impatient already to expiate its offence, 				              705To meet your arm I can feel it now advance.	Strike. Or if you think it not worthy of your blow,If your hate refuses me such sweet torment, so,Or if your hand by my vile blood would be stained,Instead of your arm lend me then your blade.				    710Offer it.Oenone	  Madame, what would you do? Gods above!	Someone's here. Avoid hateful witnesses: remove:Come, return home: flee now from certain shame.  Act II Scene VI (Hippolyte, Theramenes)TheramenesIs that Phaedra fleeing, or rather being led away?Why, my Lord, why then all these signs of grief?				    715I see you without your sword, stunned, pale beyond belief.HippolytusTheramenes, my astonishment's complete.I can't view myself without horror. Let us leave.Phaedra...No! You gods!

If they'd take elsewhere the honours they send me!Importunate girl, do you want them to see me?With what do you hope to stir my desolate heart?Rather you should hide me: I the truth impart.			    	    740My visible passions dared to appear abroad.I have said what should never be overheard.Heavens! How he listened! In how many waysThat unfeeling man evaded what I had to say!To achieve a swift departure was his only aim!				    745And how his blushes increased my sense of shame!Why did you seek to thwart my desire for death?Alas! When that sword of his sought out my breast,Did he grow pale for me, and snatch it from me?It was enough for my hand to touch it lightly,				    750To render it distasteful to that inhuman man:And for that wretched blade to soil his hands.OenoneSo in this affliction, that only breeds anguish,You nourish a passion that you should extinguish.Would it not be better, Minos' worthy daughter,				    755To search for repose amongst the nobler cares,Rule, in opposition to that ungrateful man Who resorts to flight: and govern in the land?PhaedraI rule?

He knows my ardent ecstasy.					    765I've passed the bounds of cautious modesty.In my conqueror's sight I declared my shame,Yet hope glides to my heart now all the same.You yourself, defeating my powers' eclipse,Recalling my soul, already hovering on my lips,				    770You revived me with your flattering advice.Made me see, that I might love him, with your eyes. OenoneAlas! Innocent of your misfortune, or culpable,To save you still, of what would I not be capable?But if ever its offence distressed your mind,					    775Can you forget the scornfulness of his pride?With what cruel glances his harsh severityLeft you well nigh submissive at his feet!How odious his savage pride has made him!If Phaedra only had my eyes to see him!				    	    780PhaedraOenone, he may quench this pride that wounds you.Raised in the forests, he has their wildness too.Hippolytus, hardened by their savage laws,Hears love's language he never heard before.Perhaps his astonishment explains his silence,				    785And our complaints perhaps show too much violence. OenoneThink: a barbarian formed him in her womb.PhaedraScythian, and barbarian, she's known love too.OenoneHe has a deadly hatred for all our sex.PhaedraThen I'll suffer a dearth of rivals, I expect.					    790Your advice, in short, is out of season.Serve my madness, Oenone, not my reason.His inaccessible heart is opposed to love:Let's find a weaker spot that he might be moved.The charms of Empire appeared to stir him:					    795He could not conceal it: Athens attracts him:His ships are already turned that way I find,Their fluttering sails abandoned to the wind. Seek out for me this youth and his ambition,Oenone. Make the crown glitter to his vision.				    800Let him place the sacred diadem on his brow:The honour of setting it there's all I wish now.Let's cede the power we can't hold to this man.He'll teach my son how to exercise command.Perhaps he'd truly like to replace his father.					    805I'll commit to his power both son and mother.Try every means you can to change his mind:Your words will find a more ready ear than mine.Urge him, weep; moan; paint Phaedra as dying,Don't be ashamed to adopt a suppliant's sighing.				    810I'll approve you in all: I've no hope but you.Go, I'll await you, then decide what I shall do. Act III Scene II (Phaedra)PhaedraO you, who see the shame into which I fall,Implacable Venus, am I sufficiently in thrall?You could take your cruelty no further though.				    815Your triumph's complete: your arrows all strike home.Yet cruel one, if you still seek fresh glory Attack some more rebellious enemy.Hippolytus flees you, who, braving your anger,Has never bowed his knees before your altar.				    820Your name seems to offend those proud ears of his.Goddess, take vengeance!

Theseus, angered by my confession,Will be content to exile his son, in vengeance.				    900A father, in punishing, Madame, is always a father.A light sentence will suffice to cool his anger.But even if innocent blood must still be shed,Your honour, being threatened, demands no less.The treasure's too dear to dare to compromise it.				    905Whatever sentence is pronounced, you must submit,Madame, if embattled honour would be rescued,You must sacrifice everything, even virtue.They come: I see Theseus.Phaedra		                 Hippolytus, I:I see my ruin written in his bold eye.						    910Do what you will: to you I abandon myself.In this distress, I can do nothing for myself. Act III Scene IV (Theseus, Hippolytus, Phaedra, Oenone, Theramenes)TheseusFortune has ceased to oppose my wishes,Madame, and brings to your arms...Phaedra			          Stop, Theseus,And don't profane your feelings of joyfulness.				    915I no longer deserve this gracious tenderness.You have been wronged.

Why did you let me be deceived?Could you not teach their furtive passion to me?Have they been seen speaking together, searching? 			  1235Did they seek the forest's depths: were they hiding?Alas! They had full licence of each other's eyes.Heaven approved the innocence of their sighs:They followed their loving thoughts without remorse:Each day rose clear, serene to light their course. 				  1240And I, sad, rejected by Nature outright, I hid from the day: I fled from the light.Death was the only god I dared call on.I waited for the moment of extinction, Feeding myself on venom, quenched with tears, 				  1245Too closely watched in my suffering to dareTo allow myself to drown with weeping:Tasting that deadly pleasure, with trembling,And disguising my pain behind a calm brow,Often my own tears I refused to allow.					  1250OenoneBut what will the fruit be of their hopeless love?They will never meet again.Phaedra				 They will always love.Ah, deadly thought, as I speak, at this moment, here, They brave the fury of a maddened lover!Despite the same exile that will separate them,				  1255They swear a thousand times nothing will part them.No, I cannot endure a happiness that galls me,Oenone.

His gloomy menEchoing his silence, ranged around him:				   	  1500Pensive he took the road to Mycenae:His hand had let the horses' reins hang free.His proud stallions that previously appearedNobly obeying his voice, and full of ardour,With grieving eyes and with lowered brow,					  1505Seemed responsive to his sad thoughts, now.A fearful cry, risen from the depths of the sea,Troubled, in an instant, the quiet of the scene:And from the heart of the earth a strident voiceReplied with groans to that formidable noise.				  1510The blood froze in our hearts profoundest depths The manes of the startled horses stood erect.Meanwhile over the surface of the watery plain,A liquid mountain rose through boiling waves:Neared us, shattered, and from the foaming breaker			  1515Vomited to our eyes a raging monster. Its broad brow was horned, armed with menace,Its whole body scaly, yellow as jaundice,Untameable bull, or impetuous dragon,Hindquarters coiling like a tortuous serpent.					  1520Its long-drawn out bellowing shook the shore.The heavens viewed the savage monster with horror,The earth quaked, and the air was infected,The terrified wave that carried it recoiled.All fled, and not pretending useless bravery,					  1525Each man sought refuge in the neighbouring sanctuary.Hippolyte alone, worthy to be a hero's son,Reined in his horses, seized his javelin,Drove at the monster, and with a steady handDealt him a gaping spear wound in the flank.				  1530The monster reared upwards in pain and anger,Fell at the horses' feet, groaning, rolled over,And presented its fiery muzzle to them, again,Covering them with blood, smoke and flame.Panic took them, and deaf as they were then,					  1535They recognised neither voice nor the rein.Their master exhausted himself in useless struggle,While in the blood-wet foam they stained their bridles.They even say some saw, in this wild confusion,A god who goaded their dusty flanks: a vision.				  1540Their fear drove them headlong over the rocks,The axle groaned and shattered, brave HippolytusSaw his whole chariot break into fragments.He himself fell entangled in the harness.Forgive my sorrow. That cruel sight to see					  1545Will be an eternal source of tears to me.My Lord, I have seen your unfortunate sonDragged by the horses nourished by his hand.He tried to call to them, and they feared the sound:They ran. His whole body was one vast wound.				  1550And the plain echoed to our sorrowful cries.At last they slowed their impetuous flight.They stopped not far from the ancient sepulchres,Where lie the cold relics of our ancestral rulers.Sighing I ran to him, and his guards followed.				  1555The track of his noble blood ran on ahead.The rocks were stained with it: the cruel bramblesWere strewn with his hair, in blood-wet tangles.I reached him, called: stretching out his hand to meHe opened his dying eyes: and closed them suddenly.			  1560Saying: 'From me, Heaven claims an innocent life.Take care of my dear Aricia, after I die.Dear Friend, if my father's eyes are ever opened, And he pities the fate of a falsely maligned son,And wants to appease my blood, my shade so restless,			  1565Tell him to treat his captive with tenderness,And give back to her...'

Wretched father!I condemned him because you were his accuser.				  1620Cruel one, do you think to be forgiven....PhaedraEach moment's precious to me, Theseus, listen.It was I who cast my eyes, profane, incestuousOn that son of yours, so chaste and virtuous.Heaven lit the fatal flame within my breast:					  1625That detestable Oenone managed all the rest.She feared lest Hippolytus, learning of my ardour,Might reveal a passion that filled him with horror.The traitress, profiting from my profound weakness,Hurried to you to denounce him to your face.				  1630She has punished herself, and escaped my anger,By seeking in the waves a far gentler torture.A blade would have already ended my fate too:But I wished to let virtue, suspected, cry to you.I wished, in exposing my remorse to you,					  1635To go down to the dead by a slower route.I have taken...I have spread through my burning veins,A poison that Medea brought to Athens.Already the venom flows towards my heart,An unaccustomed chill pierces my dying heart:			 	  1640Already I see as if through a clouded sky,Heaven, and a husband my presence horrifies. And Death, from my eyes, stealing the clarity,Gives back to the day, defiled, all his purity.PanopeShe dies, my Lord.Theseus			             If only the memory				  1645Of so black a crime could die with her entirely!Let me, now that my error is all too clear,Mingle my wretched son's blood with my tears.Let me clasp my dear boy, embracing what is left,To expiate the madness of a prayer I now detest.				  1650As he deserved, so let me render him honour:And, the better to appease his spirit's anger,Despite the plotting of her guilty brothers,Treat his loved one, from today, as my daughter.
