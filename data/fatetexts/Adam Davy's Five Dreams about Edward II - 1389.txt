The Legend or Life of St. Alexius,
IN FOUR VERSIONS, FROM SIX MANUSCRIPTS.

1.
The longest version, in 12-line stanzas, from Laud MS. 622, in the Bodleian.
2.
The shortest version, in couplets, from the Cotton MS., Titus A xxvi, in the British Museum.
3.
The shorter 6-line-stanza version, from the grand Vernon MS. (ab. 1400 A.D.) and Laud 108, both in the Bodleian.
4.
The longer 6-line-stanza version, from Laud MS. 463 in the Bodleian, and Trin. Coll. MS. Oxford 57 [81].
Page  18
[THE first following version of the Life of St Alexius, from Laud 622, is the longest--and latest, no doubt*. [There is a MS. of the Life in the Durham Cathedral Library, but my enquiries about it have not yet elicited any answer.],--of the English forms of the story. It was unknown to Dr Horstmann when he edited his Altenglische Legenden; and he having calld my attention to the other three versions of the Alexius legend, I have, for completeness' sake, added them here. I have also printed the Laud 108 opposite the Vernon text, from which it differs slightly sometimes in words, and in more distinctly Midland forms (waster, was there, l. 10; hauest tou, l. 490; and tou, l. 496; and te, l. 547; some a forms, like gan, l. 168), for convenience of comparison of two later repre|sentatives of one unknown original. I should perhaps apologize for wasting so much space on a mere legend of a so-calld saint's life. But the present story is the same pathetic one as Guy of Warwick's; it is prettily versified; and the comparing of the four ways in which the same incidents are told, has a certain interest: one likes to see how the religious-story writers of old spun out or shortend their material*. [Note how the shorter versions lengthen the end of the story.]: and the oddness of their notions as to the line of his images' life that pleasd the God and Father of men, is always in|structive, specially when set beside many of the popular ideas on this and like subjects now. If folk would but stop attributing to God, motives, opinions, arrangements and likings, which they'd con|sider an insult to set down to any wise and good friend of their own, how much useless bother would come to an end!

Dr Horstmann,--who edited the Laud 108 Life in Herrig's Archiv, vol. iii. p. 102-10, 1873*. [I believe that he has since edited the Vernon, Trinity and Laud-463 texts.]--says that the sources of the Alexius legend are the 'Vita metrica, auctore Marbodo, primum archidiacono Andegavensi, deinde Redonensi episcopo (? 1123)', printed in the Acta Sanctorum, Boll. 17. Juli, p. 254-256; and another 'Vita, auctore anonymo', ib. p. 251-254. To the last, the Laud 108 version is nearly related, often even in words. Eight Middle High German versions of this Legend were edited by Mass|mann, Quedlinburg, 1843. The following Early English lives do not belong to the great Collection of long-line "Saints' Lives" in the Harleian, Vernon, and other MSS, from which I printed a selec|tion*. [And mistakingly printed 'ic' as Midland or Northern 'ic', instead of the Southern 'ich'.] for the Philological Society in 1863 for its Transactions, of 1858. This Collection will be edited in a separate volume some day for the E. E. Text Society, by Dr Horstmann, after he has edited for us all the Extra Legends not in the Collection or in the Vernon Gospel-stories.]

King Solomon's Book of Wisdom,

A BOOK OF MORAL PRECEPTS AND PRACTICAL ADVICE (lines 1-105),

Taken from the Laud MS. 622's headless rymed Bible Story, and followd by the end of that Story, an account of

1 King SOLOMON'S love of Lechery, p. 85, l. 107-111. (For his Coronation, his Judgment on the Child claimd by 2 Mothers, and his Wisdom, &c., see p. 96-8);
2 of his son REHOBOAM, l. 113-131; and the separation of the Kingdoms of Judah and Israel, 132-146; p. 85-86;
3 legends of the prophet ELIJAH, 150; his raising the prophet Jonah*. [That Jonah was the son of the widow of Zarephath is in the Midrash Yalqut (a legendary Commentary on the Old Testament, called Yalqut) to the book Jonah, quoted from the Talmud of Jerusalem.--A. Neubauer.] (the widow of Zarephath's son, 1 Kings xvii. 17) to life, 156-65; going to Horeb, 166-73; his choosing Elisha, 174-7; burning up king Ahaziah's messengers (2 Kings i. 10-12), 178-199; and going to heaven in a fiery horse and cart (2 Kings ii. 11), 200-213; p. 86-88;
4 of ELISHA, his purifying a well with salt, 214-225 (2 Kings ii. 19-22); and multiplying a poor woman's oil, 226-233 (2 Kings iv. 1-3); p. 88;
5 of DANIEL in the lions' den, fed with Abacue's food, 234-263; and of Apostles and Friars preaching Christianity, 264-7; p. 88-89;
6 of the Day of Doom, 268; and herein, p. 89-90;
7 of ANTICHRIST, 272; how he shall go into the Holy Land, 274; slay Enoch and Eli, who have come to earth from Paradise to fight him, 292-6; and shall then himself be smitten to death by the Holy Ghost in the form of a sword.
All in alternate fours and threes*. [A few fours, as 183, 202, 207, are but three measures; while a few threes, as 234 and 244, are fours.], the latter ryming. In the rymes the equiva|lence of final '?th' with '?t' is to be noted*. [Cp. Havelok, fiht, rith, 2716; with, knith = wiht, knight, 2720.--Skeat.],--l. 52, 51, 71-2; (but see 57-8, 7-8, 19-24, 33-4, &c.),--and these forms and rymes: prep. mytte (with), wytte, 43-4; but 'myde', iryde (ridden), 249-50; er?e, fier?e (fourth), 99-100; mesure, here, 89-90; consaile (obl.), availe (inf.), 115-16; but conseil (obj.), israel, 141-2; sei?e (3 pl. perf. saw), di?e (inf. die), 191-2; but 'sei?', on hei? (high), 201-2; pite (put,? inf., imp., or subj.), a 'lite' (little), 225-6; ydytte (pp. of dihtan, see 254) 'pytte' (pit), 241-2; vchone, fon, 262-3. The ie is right: folie, wrie (inf.), 79-80; Elye, prophecie, 152-3, &c. The final e can hardly be allowd to ?ing (obl.) to match springe (inf.), 3-4 (see 59-60); cp. telle, wel, 55-6. Mowe, abou?e, 27-8, seem to show the silence of ?. There are two 'longe' s probably of the same mean|ing ryming, 91-2. The ryming of 'ysed' (pp.) with 'ded' (dead, pp.), 195-6; of 'sede' (perf.) with 'falshede', 266, and the six '-ede' words in 267-272 (drede among them); of 'seide' with 'rede', 179-180, shows that the Elizabethan and our 'sed' is not, as has been asserted, a mere late slurring of the broad 'said', tho' that form or spelling has won in the fight for the survival of the fittest.

?at ?e widewe son died; he was yhote Ionas;      156
Elie arered hym fram de? to lyue; ?orou? goddes sonde;
And si?en he was a prophete; ?e wisest in ?e londe.

As it goddes will was; he had mychel ?onk.

And wende a?ein to israel; & no?ing ne drede.      168
"// A Man ?at hatte Elisee; by ?e waie ?ou schalt fynde;
?ou schalt hym take for? wi? ?e; ?at he ne leue bihynde."
Elie ?e prophete went for?; til he in-to desert cam.      171
He fonde Elyse gon on ?e pleyn; with hym for? he hym nam
To ?e londe of israel*. [MS. isrk.]; ?ai nadden of ?e kyng non eye.
Elise fonde ano?er prophete; & ?ider ?ai wenten beie.
?o lay ?e kyng sore seek; & ?o it was hym ysed,
Elye tolde his messagers; ?at he schulde be ded.      176
He hete his men wende after hym; ?at ?ai sparen ne scholde;
He wende, ?if he mi?th hym haue hadd; ?at he hym hele wolde.
?ei wenten for? & comen to Elye; "goddes man" ?ai seide:
"?e kyng hete ?e come & speke with hym; ?if ?ou cou?est hym rede."      180
Elie seide "?if ich am goddes man; I. bid god al-one,
?at wilde fire come fram heuen adoun; & brenne ?ou vchone."
Amyd ?is word onon; fire fram heuen com,
And brent ?ise men al to dust; ?ere was an hard dom.      184
Sore alonged was ?e kyng; after hym ylome;
Tueie he sent of o?er men; ?o ?ai nou?[th] ne come.

And as ?e o?er ?ai weren serued; ibrou?th on li?th leie.      188
?o ?ai ne comen nou?th a?ein; ?e kyng ?ou?th longe,
And lete sende after hym; wise men & stronge.
// ?erne ?ai crieden mercie; ?o ?ai Elye sei?e:
"Haue mercy on ?e kyng; or elles he schal di?e."      192
?erof seide Elye; "Siker he may be.
Ac, forto paye his corage; ich wil hym ones see."
Elye went for? to ?e kyng; & seide he schulde be ded;
And sone he died ?erafter-ward; as he had ysed.      196
Elie & Elisee in ?e londe; wide aboute went,
For to tellen of prophecie; as oure lorde hem sent.
As ?ai precheden goddes lawe; from heuen ?ere ali?th

In ?e cart to heuen; ?at men neuer eft hym ne sei?.
// Ri?th to heuen ne segge ich nou?th; ?at he euer come,
For he schal haue fleschlich lyf; forto a?eins ?e day of dome.

?O Ely in ?is fair cart; to heuen was ylad, [folio 70b] *. [Elye]

A Womman cried on Elisee; as sche hym mette,*. [Eliseus]

A Wise prophete was in ?at londe; ?at hi?th Danyel.*. [?Danyel.]

St. Jeremie's 15 Tokens before Doomsday. WITH LAMENTACIO ANIMARUM, WHAT OUR LORD SHALL DO AND SAY ON THAT DOOMSDAY; AND A SONG OF JOY AND BLISS, TO PRAISE THAT SWEET DEW, CHRIST.

(See other englisht copies of these '15 Tokens' attributed to St. Jerome, in my Early English Poems (Philolog. Soc. 1862), p. 7-12, and p. 162-4 (from Metrical Homilies, ed. Small, before publication); my Hymns to the Virgin and Christ (E. E. T. S., 1867), p. 118-125; Dr Morris's 'Hampole's Pricke of Conscience' (Philolog. Soc.), p. 135, l. 4738, &c, and Cursor Mundi (E.

Bellin in 1592), vol. ii. 147-9; and in the same vol., p. 219-21 (from Harl. MS. 913, ab. 1309 A.D.), and p. 222-4 (from Harl. 2255); Mr Small's Northern 'Metrical Homilies', p. 25-6, given also in Morris and Skeat's Speci|mens of Early English, 1298-1393, p. 83-5; Sir David Lyndesay's Monarche, book iv, l. 5462 (in Skeat's Specimens, 1394-1579, p. 254-6), &c, &c, &c. Old Friesic has a version of these 15 Tokens, says Mr Skeat: see Richtofen, Friesische Rechtsquellen, p. 130. Mr Small says that 'no copy of the original is to be found in the Benedictine edition of Jerome's Works'; and Mr Wright states that 'others say they are first found in the Prognosticon futuri seculi of Julianus Pomerius, a theologian, who died in the year 690'.)

The Song that follows the Signs here, has pretty bits and good words in it.

Of litel more ?an .xxxti. wyntren; as ich ?ou habbe ised,

An Aungel schal ?e spere & ?e nails; & ?e crovne of ?orn,

In ?e vale of Iosephat; his dom he wil do;

Leuere had his owen moder; in helle pyne to be,
Al ?e while ?e dom ylast; ?an her sones face to see.      32
Allas! hou schull we ?an ouercome; ?ilk griselich fere,

OVre lord wil schewe his bitter woundes; And Sigge, "Man! for ?e,      35
Look what ich haue ysuffred; what hastow suffred for me?"
Mest he wil vnderstonde ?ere; ?e vij. merciful dedes:
Who ?at ha? hem here ydo; as he with his mou? sede,

OVre lord wil to ?e li?er sigge; as we reden in gospelle,

OVre lord wil to good men sigge; "in my ri?th honde ?e come,

In ?is book we finde ywrite; ?at ?re manere folk schal saued be,

Ich bid hym ?at vs deme schal; kyng of all kynge,
Among his blissed sones; oure soules to heuen brynge. Amen.

And all blis hym was bynome; & oft he gradd ?erfore:

SOLOMON'S CORONATION, DEEDS, AND JUDGMENT ON THE TWO MOTHERS' CLAIM TO ONE CHILD. HIS COURT AND TEMPLE.

[In order to complete the Life of Solomon, of which his Book of Wisdom, &c., form part, I add the MS. bit that comes before the Book. The passage about his birth is too far back to be taken.]

[Laud MS. 622, leaf 69, col. 1.]

? ?o Dauid in elde was; his eldest son was alyue.
Adonye ycleped he was; with Salamon he gan striue.
Aboute he was kyng to be; by his fader daye.
Gret feste he made on a day; ?at folk to paye.      4*
He ne bad nowgth ?ider Salamon; ne his moder ?e quene;
?erfore sche was with hym wro?; for wymmen be? oft kene.
"Sir," sche seide to Dauid; "oft ?ou swore me,
?at my son Salamon; schulde be kyng after ?e.      8*
Now ha? Adonye i?ou?th to be kyng bi ?i lyue;
& after ?i day to sle my son; for ?ai ne ben by on wyue."
Page  97
?E kyng lete somony all his men: a fest he made sone, [folio 69:2]
And lete coroone Salamon; & sette hym in his throne.
By his lyue he made hym kyng; & bigan to prechi fast
fforto sustene vp goddes law?e; ?er-while his lif ylast;
?at he bulde for? goddes hous in Ierusalems burgh?,
?at ?e law?es better weren; ysustened ?orou? & ?orou?.      16*
Dauid was kyng fourty wyntren; in werre & in strife;
And in ?e fourtide ?er; in pes he ended his lyf.
Afftere his fader, Salamon; slou? his bro?er Adonye
In ?e first ?er, & all ?at with hym weren; to hym he made boweye,      20*
& he wex fai?ful man & wis; ?at folk better to wisse,
?e kynges dou?ttere of Egipte; he wedded in gret blisse.
?e grete ?inges forto don; he destred*. [[? desired]] goddes grace,
fforto arere goddes temple; in on faire place,      24*
And aboute Ierusalem; treble wal arere.
?at to his bihof?e & vche riche kyng; ?e court arered were,
His sacrifise he dude to god; & gan to hym crie:
"Lorde!" he seide, "to ?ong icham; to haue suich maistrie.
