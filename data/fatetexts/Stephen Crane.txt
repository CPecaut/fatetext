                                   I

    Black Riders came from the sea.
    There was clang and clang of spear and shield,
    And clash and clash of hoof and heel,
    Wild shouts and the wave of hair
    In the rush upon the wind:
    Thus the ride of Sin.



                                   II

    Three little birds in a row
    Sat musing.
    A man passed near that place.
    Then did the little birds nudge each other.
    They said, "He thinks he can sing."
    They threw back their heads to laugh,
    With quaint countenances
    They regarded him.
    They were very curious,
    Those three little birds in a row.



                                  III

    In the desert
    I saw a creature, naked, bestial,
    Who, squatting upon the ground,
    Held his heart in his hands,
    And ate of it.
    I said, "Is it good, friend?"
    "It is bitter--bitter," he answered;
    "But I like it
    Because it is bitter,
    And because it is my heart."



                                   IV

    Yes, I have a thousand tongues,
    And nine and ninety-nine lie.
    Though I strive to use the one,
    It will make no melody at my will,
    But is dead in my mouth.



                                   V

    Once there came a man
    Who said,
    "Range me all men of the world in rows."
    And instantly
    There was terrific clamor among the people
    Against being ranged in rows.
    There was a loud quarrel, world-wide.
    It endured for ages;
    And blood was shed
    By those who would not stand in rows,
    And by those who pined to stand in rows,
    Eventually, the man went to death, weeping.
    And those who staid in bloody scuffle
    Knew not the great simplicity.



                                   VI

    God fashioned the ship of the world carefully
    With the infinite skill of an All-Master
    Made He the hull and the sails,
    Held He the rudder
    Ready for adjustment.
    Erect stood He, scanning his work proudly.
    Then--at fateful time--a Wrong called,
    And God turned, heeding.
    Lo, the ship, at this opportunity, slipped slyly,
    Making cunning noiseless travel down the ways.
    So that, forever rudderless, it went upon the seas
    Going ridiculous voyages,
    Making quaint progress,
    Turning as with serious purpose
    Before stupid winds.
    And there were many in the sky
    Who laughed at this thing.



                                  VII

    Mystic Shadow, bending near me,
    Who art thou?
    Whence come ye?
    And--tell me--is it fair
    Or is the truth bitter as eaten fire?
    Tell me!
    Fear not that I should quaver,
    For I dare--I dare.
    Then, tell me!



                                  VIII

    I looked here;
    I looked there;
    Nowhere could I see my love.
    And--this time--
    She was in my heart.
    Truly, then, I have no complaint,
    For though she be fair and fairer,
    She is none so fair as she
    In my heart.



                                   IX

    I stood upon a high place,
    And saw, below, many devils
    Running, leaping,
    And carousing in sin.
    One looked up, grinning,
    And said, "Comrade!  Brother!"



                                   X

    Should the wide world roll away,
    Leaving black terror,
    Limitless night,
    Nor God, nor man, nor place to stand
    Would be to me essential,
    If thou and thy white arms were there,
    And the fall to doom a long way.



                                   XI

    In a lonely place,
    I encountered a sage
    Who sat, all still,
    Regarding a newspaper.
    He accosted me:
    "Sir, what is this?"
    Then I saw that I was greater,
    Aye, greater than this sage.
    I answered him at once,
    "Old, old man, it is the wisdom of the age."
    The sage looked upon me with admiration.



                                  XII

    "and the sins of the fathers shall be
    visited upon the heads of the children,
    even unto the third and fourth
    generation of them that hate me."

    Well, then, I hate thee, Unrighteous Picture;
    Wicked Image, I hate thee;
    So, strike with thy vengeance
    The heads of those little men
    Who come blindly.
    It will be a brave thing.



                                  XIII

    If there is a witness to my little life,
    To my tiny throes and struggles,
    He sees a fool;
    And it is not fine for gods to menace fools.



                                  XIV

    There was crimson clash of war.
    Lands turned black and bare;
    Women wept;
    Babes ran, wondering.
    There came one who understood not these things.
    He said, "Why is this?"
    Whereupon a million strove to answer him.
    There was such intricate clamor of tongues,
    That still the reason was not.



                                   XV

    "Tell brave deeds of war."

    Then they recounted tales,--
    "There were stern stands
    "And bitter runs for glory."

    Ah, I think there were braver deeds.



                                  XVI

    Chanty, thou art a lie,
    A toy of women,
    A pleasure of certain men.
    In the presence of justice,
    Lo, the walls of the temple
    Are visible
    Through thy form of sudden shadows.



                                  XVII

    There were many who went in huddled procession,
    They knew not whither;
    But, at any rate, success or calamity
    Would attend all in equality.

    There was one who sought a new road.
    He went into direful thickets,
    And ultimately he died thus, alone;
    But they said he had courage.



                                 XVIII

    In Heaven,
    Some little blades of grass
    Stood before God.
    "What did you do?"
    Then all save one of the little blades
    Began eagerly to relate
    The merits of their lives.
    This one stayed a small way behind,
    Ashamed.
    Presently, God said,
    "And what did you do?"
    The little blade answered, "Oh, my Lord,
    "Memory is bitter to me,
    "For, if I did good deeds,
    "I know not of them."
    Then God, in all His splendor,
    Arose from His throne.
    "Oh, best little blade of grass!" He said.



                                  XIX

    A god in wrath
    Was beating a man;
    He cuffed him loudly
    With thunderous blows
    That rang and rolled over the earth.
    All people came running.
    The man screamed and struggled,
    And bit madly at the feet of the god.
    The people cried,
    "Ah, what a wicked man!"
    And--
    "Ah, what a redoubtable god!"



                                   XX

    A learned man came to me once.
    He said, "I know the way,--come."
    And I was overjoyed at this.
    Together we hastened.
    Soon, too soon, were we
    Where my eyes were useless,
    And I knew not the ways of my feet
    I clung to the hand of my friend;
    But at last he cried, "I am lost."



                                  XXI

    There was, before me,
    Mile upon mile
    Of snow, ice, burning sand.
    And yet I could look beyond all this,
    To a place of infinite beauty;
    And I could see the loveliness of her
    Who walked in the shade of the trees.
    When I gazed,
    All was lost
    But this place of beauty and her.
    When I gazed,
    And in my gazing, desired,
    Then came again
    Mile upon mile,
    Of snow, ice, burning sand.



                                  XXII

    Once I saw Mountains angry,
    And ranged in battle-front.
    Against them stood a little man;
    Aye, he was no bigger than my finger.
    I laughed, and spoke to one near me,
    "Will he prevail?"
    "Surely," replied this other;
    "His grandfathers beat them many times."
    Then did I see much virtue in grandfathers,--
    At least, for the little man
    Who stood against the Mountains.



                                 XXIII

    Places among the stars,
    Soft gardens near the sun,
    Keep your distant beauty;
    Shed no beams upon my weak heart.
    Since she is here
    In a place of blackness,
    Not your golden days
    Nor your silver nights
    Can call me to you.
    Since she is here
    In a place of blackness,
    Here I stay and wait.



                                  XXIV

    I saw a man pursuing the horizon;
    Round and round they sped.
    I was disturbed at this;
    I accosted the man.
    "It is futile," I said,
    "You can never"--

    "You lie," he cried,
    And ran on.



                                  XXV

    Behold, the grave of a wicked man,
    And near it, a stern spirit.

    There came a drooping maid with violets,
    But the spirit grasped her arm.
    "No flowers for him," he said.
    The maid wept:
    "Ah, I loved him."
    But the spirit, grim and frowning:
    "No flowers for him."

    Now, this is it--
    If the spirit was just,
    Why did the maid weep?



                                  XXVI

    There was set before me a mighty hill,
    And long days I climbed
    Through regions of snow.
    When I had before me the summit-view,
    It seemed that my labor
    Had been to see gardens
    Lying at impossible distances.



                                 XXVII

    A youth in apparel that glittered
    Went to walk in a grim forest.
    There he met an assassin
    Attired all in garb of old days;
    He, scowling through the thickets,
    And dagger poised quivering,
    Rushed upon the youth.
    "Sir," said this latter,
    "I am enchanted, believe me,
    "To die, thus,
    "In this medieval fashion,
    "According to the best legends;
    "Ah, what joy!"
    Then took he the wound, smiling,
    And died, content.



                                 XXVIII

    "Truth," said a traveller,
    "Is a rock, a mighty fortress;
    "Often have I been to it,
    "Even to its highest tower,
    "From whence the world looks black."

    "Truth," said a traveller,
    "Is a breath, a wind,
    "A shadow, a phantom;
    "Long have I pursued it,
    "But never have I touched
    "The hem of its garment."

    And I believed the second traveller;
    For truth was to me
    A breath, a wind,
    A shadow, a phantom,
    And never had I touched
    The hem of its garment.



                                  XXIX

    Behold, from the land of the farther suns
    I returned.
    And I was in a reptile-swarming place,
    Peopled, otherwise, with grimaces,
    Shrouded above in black impenetrableness.
    I shrank, loathing,
    Sick with it.
    And I said to him,
    "What is this?"
    He made answer slowly,
    "Spirit, this is a world;
    "This was your home."



                                  XXX

    Supposing that I should have the courage
    To let a red sword of virtue
    Plunge into my heart,
    Letting to the weeds of the ground
    My sinful blood,
    What can you offer me?
    A gardened castle?
    A flowery kingdom?

    What?  A hope?
    Then hence with your red sword of virtue.



                                  XXXI

    Many workmen
    Built a huge ball of masonry
    Upon a mountain-top.
    Then they went to the valley below,
    And turned to behold their work.
    "It is grand," they said;
    They loved the thing.

    Of a sudden, it moved:
    It came upon them swiftly;
    It crushed them all to blood.
    But some had opportunity to squeal.



                                 XXXII

    Two or three angels
    Came near to the earth.
    They saw a fat church.
    Little black streams of people
    Came and went in continually.
    And the angels were puzzled
    To know why the people went thus,
    And why they stayed so long within.



                                 XXXIII

    There was one I met upon the road
    Who looked at me with kind eyes.
    He said, "Show me of your wares."
    And this I did,
    Holding forth one.
    He said, "It is a sin."
    Then held I forth another;
    He said, "It is a sin."
    Then held I forth another;
    He said, "It is a sin."
    And so to the end;
    Always he said, "It is a sin."
    And, finally, I cried out,
    "But I have none other."
    Then did he look at me
    With kinder eyes.
    "Poor soul!" he said.



                                 XXXIV

    I stood upon a highway,
    And, behold, there came
    Many strange pedlers.
    To me each one made gestures.
    Holding forth little images, saying,
    "This is my pattern of God.
    "Now this is the God I prefer."

    But I said, "Hence!
    "Leave me with mine own,
    "And take you yours away;
    "I can't buy of your patterns of God,
    "The little Gods you may rightly prefer."



                                  XXXV

    A man saw a ball of gold in the sky;
    He climbed for it,
    And eventually he achieved it--
    It was clay.

    Now this is the strange part:
    When the man went to the earth
    And looked again,
    Lo, there was the ball of gold.
    Now this is the strange part:
    It was a ball of gold.
    Aye, by the Heavens, it was a ball of gold.



                                 XXXVI

    I met a seer.
    He held in his hands
    The book of wisdom.
    "Sir," I addressed him,
    "Let me read."
    "Child--" he began.
    "Sir," I said,
    "Think not that I am a child,
    "For already I know much
    "Of that which you hold.
    "Aye, much."

    He smiled.
    Then he opened the book
    And held it before me.--
    Strange that I should have grown so suddenly blind.



                                 XXXVII

    On the horizon the peaks assembled;
    And as I looked,
    The march of the mountains began.
    As they marched, they sang,
    "Aye!  We come!  We come!"



                                XXXVIII

    The ocean said to me once,
    "Look!
    "Yonder on the shore
    "Is a woman, weeping.
    "I have watched her.
    "Go you and tell her this,--
    "Her lover I have laid
    "In cool green hall.
    "There is wealth of golden sand
    "And pillars, coral-red;
    "Two white fish stand guard at his bier.

    "Tell her this
    "And more,--
    "That the king of the seas
    "Weeps too, old, helpless man.
    "The bustling fates
    "Heap his hands with corpses
    "Until he stands like a child,
    "With surplus of toys."



                                 XXXIX

    The livid lightnings flashed in the clouds;
    The leaden thunders crashed.
    A worshipper raised his arm.
    "Hearken!  Hearken!  The voice of God!"

    "Not so," said a man.
    "The voice of God whispers in the heart
    "So softly
    "That the soul pauses,
    "Making no noise,
    "And strives for these melodies,
    "Distant, sighing, like faintest breath,
    "And all the being is still to hear."



                                   XL

    And you love me?

    I love you.

    You are, then, cold coward.

    Aye; but, beloved,
    When I strive to come to you,
    Man's opinions, a thousand thickets,
    My interwoven existence,
    My life,
    Caught in the stubble of the world
    Like a tender veil,--
    This stays me.
    No strange move can I make
    Without noise of tearing.
    I dare not.

    If love loves,
    There is no world
    Nor word.
    All is lost
    Save thought of love
    And place to dream.
    You love me?

    I love you.

    You are, then, cold coward.

    Aye; but beloved--



                                  XLI

    Love walked alone.
    The rocks cut her tender feet,
    And the brambles tore her fair limbs.
    There came a companion to her,
    But, alas, he was no help,
    For his name was Heart's Pain.



                                  XLII

    I walked in a desert.
    And I cried,
    "Ah, God, take me from this place!"
    A voice said, "It is no desert."
    I cried, "Well, but--
    "The sand, the heat, the vacant horizon."
    A voice said, "It is no desert."



                                 XLIII

    There came whisperings in the winds
    "Good bye!  Good bye!"
    Little voices called in the darkness:
    "Good bye!  Good bye!"
    Then I stretched forth my arms.
    "No--no--"
    There came whisperings in the wind:
    "Good bye!  Good bye!"
    Little voices called in the darkness:
    "Good bye!  Good bye!"



                                  XLIV

    I was in the darkness;
    I could not see my words
    Nor the wishes of my heart.
    Then suddenly there was a great light--
    "Let me into the darkness again."



                                  XLV

    Tradition, thou art for suckling children,
    Thou art the enlivening milk for babes;
    But no meat for men is in thee.
    Then--
    But, alas, we all are babes.



                                  XLVI

    Many red devils ran from my heart
    And out upon the page,
    They were so tiny
    The pen could mash them.
    And many struggled in the ink.
    It was strange
    To write in this red muck
    Of things from my heart.



                                 XLVII

    "Think as I think," said a man,
    "Or you are abominably wicked;
    "You are a toad."

    And after I had thought of it,
    I said, "I will, then, be a toad."



                                 XLVIII

    Once there was a man,--
    Oh, so wise!
    In all drink
    He detected the bitter,
    And in all touch
    He found the sting.
    At last he cried thus:
    "There is nothing,--
    "No life,
    "No joy,
    "No pain,--
    "There is nothing save opinion,
    "And opinion be damned."



                                  XLIX

    I stood musing in a black world,
    Not knowing where to direct my feet.
    And I saw the quick stream of men
    Pouring ceaselessly,
    Filled with eager faces,
    A torrent of desire.
    I called to them,
    "Where do you go?  What do you see?"
    A thousand voices called to me.
    A thousand fingers pointed.
    "Look!  Look!  There!"

    I know not of it.
    But, lo! in the far sky shone a radiance
    Ineffable, divine,--
    A vision painted upon a pall;
    And sometimes it was,
    And sometimes it was not.
    I hesitated.
    Then from the stream
    Came roaring voices,
    Impatient:
    "Look!  Look!  There!"

    So again I saw,
    And leaped, unhesitant,
    And struggled and fumed
    With outspread clutching fingers.
    The hard hills tore my flesh;
    The ways bit my feet.
    At last I looked again.
    No radiance in the far sky,
    Ineffable, divine;
    No vision painted upon a pall;
    And always my eyes ached for the light.
    Then I cried in despair,
    "I see nothing! Oh, where do I go?"
    The torrent turned again its faces:
    "Look!  Look!  There!"
    And at the blindness of my spirit
    They screamed,
    "Fool!  Fool!  Fool!"



                                   L

    You say you are holy,
    And that
    Because I have not seen you sin.
    Aye, but there are those
    Who see you sin, my friend.



                                   LI

    A man went before a strange god,--
    The god of many men, sadly wise.
    And the deity thundered loudly,
    Fat with rage, and puffing,
    "Kneel, mortal, and cringe
    "And grovel and do homage
    "To my particularly sublime majesty."

    The man fled.

    Then the man went to another god,--
    The god of his inner thoughts.
    And this one looked at him
    With soft eyes
    Lit with infinite comprehension,
    And said, "My poor child!"



                                  LII

    Why do you strive for greatness, fool?
    Go pluck a bough and wear it.
    It is as sufficing.

    My lord, there are certain barbarians
    Who tilt their noses
    As if the stars were flowers,
    And thy servant is lost among their shoe-buckles.
    Fain would I have mine eyes even with their eyes.

    Fool, go pluck a bough and wear it.



                                  LIII

                                   I

    Blustering god,
    Stamping across the sky
    With loud swagger,
    I fear you not.
    No, though from your highest heaven
    You plunge your spear at my heart,
    I fear you not.
    No, not if the blow
    Is as the lightning blasting a tree,
    I fear you not, puffing braggart.

                                   II

    If thou can see into my heart
    That I fear thee not,
    Thou wilt see why I fear thee not,
    And why it is right.
    So threaten not, thou, with thy bloody spears,
    Else thy sublime ears shall hear curses.


                                  III

    Withal, there is one whom I fear;
    I fear to see grief upon that face.
    Perchance, Friend, he is not your god;
    If so, spit upon him.
    By it you will do no profanity.
    But I--
    Ah, sooner would I die
    Than see tears in those eyes of my soul.



                                  LIV

    "It was wrong to do this," said the angel.
    "You should live like a flower,
    "Holding malice like a puppy,
    "Waging war like a lambkin."

    "Not so," quoth the man
    Who had no fear of spirits;
    "It is only wrong for angels
    "Who can live like the flowers,
    "Holding malice like the puppies,
    "Waging war like the lambkins."



                                   LV

    A man toiled on a burning road,
    Never resting.
    Once he saw a fat, stupid ass
    Grinning at him from a green place.
    The man cried out in rage,
    "Ah!  Do not deride me, fool!
    "I know you--
    "All day stuffing your belly,
    "Burying your heart
    "In grass and tender sprouts:
    "It will not suffice you."
    But the ass only grinned at him from the green place.



                                  LVI

    A man feared that he might find an assassin;
    Another that he might find a victim.
    One was more wise than the other.



                                  LVII

    With eye and with gesture
    You say you are holy.
    I say you lie;
    For I did see you
    Draw away your coats
    From the sin upon the hands
    Of a little child.
    Liar!



                                 LVIII

    The sage lectured brilliantly.
    Before him, two images:
    "Now this one is a devil,
    "And this one is me."
    He turned away.
    Then a cunning pupil
    Changed the positions.
    Turned the sage again:
    "Now this one is a devil,
    "And this one is me."
    The pupils sat, all grinning,
    And rejoiced in the game.
    But the sage was a sage.



                                  LIX

    Walking in the sky,
    A man in strange black garb
    Encountered a radiant form.
    Then his steps were eager;
    Bowed he devoutly.
    "My Lord," said he.
    But the spirit knew him not.



                                   LX

    Upon the road of my life,
    Passed me many fair creatures,
    Clothed all in white, and radiant.
    To one, finally, I made speech:
    "Who art thou?"
    But she, like the others,
    Kept cowled her face,
    And answered in haste, anxiously,
    "I am Good Deed, forsooth;
    "You have often seen me."
    "Not uncowled," I made reply.
    And with rash and strong hand,
    Though she resisted,
    I drew away the veil
    And gazed at the features of Vanity
    She, shamefaced, went on;
    And after I had mused a time,
    I said of myself,
      "Fool!"



                                  LXI

                                   I

    There was a man and a woman
    Who sinned.
    Then did the man heap the punishment
    All upon the head of her,
    And went away gayly.


                                   II

    There was a man and a woman
    Who sinned.
    And the man stood with her.
    As upon her head, so upon his,
    Fell blow and blow,
    And all people screaming, "Fool!"
    He was a brave heart.


                                  III

    He was a brave heart.
    Would you speak with him, friend?
    Well, he is dead,
    And there went your opportunity.
    Let it be your grief
    That he is dead
    And your opportunity gone;
    For, in that, you were a coward.



                                  LXII

    There was a man who lived a life of fire.
    Even upon the fabric of time,
    Where purple becomes orange
    And orange purple,
    This life glowed,
    A dire red stain, indelible;
    Yet when he was dead,
    He saw that he had not lived.



                                 LXIII

    There was a great cathedral.
    To solemn songs,
    A white procession
    Moved toward the altar.
    The chief man there
    Was erect, and bore himself proudly.
    Yet some could see him cringe,
    As in a place of danger,
    Throwing frightened glances into the air,
    A-start at threatening faces of the past.



                                  LXIV

    Friend, your white beard sweeps the ground,
    Why do you stand, expectant?
    Do you hope to see it
    In one of your withered days?
    With your old eyes
    Do you hope to see
    The triumphal march of Justice?
    Do not wait, friend
    Take your white beard
    And your old eyes
    To more tender lands.



                                  LXV

    Once, I knew a fine song,
    --It is true, believe me,--
    It was all of birds,
    And I held them in a basket;
    When I opened the wicket,
    Heavens!  They all flew away.
    I cried, "Come back, little thoughts!"
    But they only laughed.
    They flew on
    Until they were as sand
    Thrown between me and the sky.



                                  LXVI

    If I should cast off this tattered coat,
    And go free into the mighty sky;
    If I should find nothing there
    But a vast blue,
    Echoless, ignorant,--
    What then?



                                 LXVII

    God lay dead in Heaven;
    Angels sang the hymn of the end;
    Purple winds went moaning,
    Their wings drip-dripping
    With blood
    That fell upon the earth.
    It, groaning thing,
    Turned black and sank.
    Then from the far caverns
    Of dead sins
    Came monsters, livid with desire.
    They fought,
    Wrangled over the world,
    A morsel.
    But of all sadness this was sad,--
    A woman's arms tried to shield
    The head of a sleeping man
    From the jaws of the final beast.



                                 LXVIII

    A spirit sped
    Through spaces of night;
    And as he sped, he called,
    "God!  God!"
    He went through valleys
    Of black death-slime,
    Ever calling,
    "God!  God!"
    Their echoes
    From crevice and cavern
    Mocked him:
    "God!  God!  God!"
    Fleetly into the plains of space
    He went, ever calling,
    "God!  God!"
    Eventually, then, he screamed,
    Mad in denial,
    "Ah, there is no God!"

    A swift hand,
    A sword from the sky,
    Smote him,
    And he was dead.

*1.F.*

*1.F.1.* Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg(TM)


Project Gutenberg(TM) is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg(TM)'s goals
and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg(TM) collection will remain freely
available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and
permanent future for Project Gutenberg(TM) and future generations. To learn

your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the
Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org .

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation


Project Gutenberg(TM) depends upon and cannot survive without wide spread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the
number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely
distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest array of
equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to
$5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with
the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where
we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any
statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside
the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways

WAR IS KIND

by Stephen Crane

Drawings by Will Bradley

1899



  Do not weep, maiden, for war is kind.
  Because your lover threw wild hands toward the sky
  And the affrighted steed ran on alone,
  Do not weep.
  War is kind.

         Hoarse, booming drums of the
             regiment,
         Little souls who thirst for fight,
         These men were born to drill and die.
         The unexplained glory files above
            them,
         Great is the battle-god, great, and his
             kingdom--
         A field where a thousand corpses lie.

  Do not weep, babe, for war is kind.
  Because your father tumbled in the yellow
      trenches,
  Raged at his breast, gulped and died,
  Do not weep.
  War is kind.

         Swift blazing flag of the regiment,
         Eagle with crest of red and gold,
         These men were born to drill and die.
         Point for them the virtue of the slaughter,
          Make plain to them the excellence of killing
         And a field where a thousand corpses
             lie.

  Mother whose heart hung humble as a button
  On the bright splendid shroud of your son,
  Do not weep.
  War is kind.




  What says the sea, little shell?
  "What says the sea?
  "Long has our brother been silent to us,
  "Kept his message for the ships,
  "Awkward ships, stupid ships."

  "The sea bids you mourn, O Pines,
  "Sing low in the moonlight.
  "He sends tale of the land of doom,
  "Of place where endless falls
  "A rain of women's tears,
  "And men in grey robes--
  "Men in grey robes--
  "Chant the unknown pain."

  "What says the sea, little shell?
  "What says the sea?
  "Long has our brother been silent to us,
  "Kept is message for the ships,
  "Puny ships, silly ships."

  "The sea bids you teach, O Pines,
  "Sing low in the moonlight;
  "Teach the gold of patience,
  "Cry gospel of gentle hands,
  "Cry a brotherhood of hearts.
  "The sea bids you teach, O Pines."

  "And where is the reward, little shell?
  "What says the sea?
  "Long has our brother been silent to us,
  "Kept his message for the ships,
  "Puny ships, silly ships."

  "No word says the sea, O Pines,
  "No word says the sea.
  "Long will your brother be silent to you,
  "Keep his message for the ships,
  "O puny ships, silly pines."




  To the maiden
  The sea was blue meadow,
  Alive with little froth-people
  Singing.

  To the sailor, wrecked,
  The sea was dead grey walls
  Superlative in vacancy,
  Upon which nevertheless at fateful time
  Was written
  The grim hatred of nature.




  A little ink more or less!
  It surely can't matter?
  Even the sky and the opulent sea,
  The plains and the hills, aloof,
  Hear the uproar of all these books.
  But it is only a little ink more or less.

  What?
  You define me God with these trinkets?
  Can my misery meal on an ordered walking
  Of surpliced numskulls?
  And a fanfare of lights?
  Or even upon the measured pulpitings
  Of the familiar false and true?
  Is this God?
  Where, then is hell?
  Show me some bastard mushrooms
  Sprung from a pollution of blood.
  It is better.

  Where is God?




  "Have you ever made a just man?"
  "Oh, I have made three," answered
       God,
  "But two of them are dead,
  "And the third--
  "Listen! Listen!
  "And you will hear the thud of his defeat."




  I explain the silvered passing of a ship
       at night,
  The sweep of each sad lost wave,
  The dwindling boom of the steel thing's striving,
  The little cry of a man to a man,
  A shadow falling across the greyer night,
  And the sinking of the small star;

  Then the waste, the far waste of waters,
  And the soft lashing of black waves
  For long and in loneliness.

  Remember, thou, O ship of love,
  Thou leavest a far waste of waters,
  And the soft lashing of black waves
  For long and in loneliness.




  "I have heard the sunset song of the
      birches,
  "A white melody in the silence,
  "I have seen a quarrel of the pines.
  "At nightfall
  "The little grasses have rushed by me
  "With the wind men.
  "These things have I lived," quoth the
     maniac,
  "Possessing only eyes and ears.
  "But you--
  "You don green spectacles before you look at roses."




  Fast rode the knight
  With spurs, hot and reeking,
  Ever waving an eager sword,
  "To save my lady!"
  Fast rode the knight,
  And leaped from saddle to war.
  Men of steel flickered and gleamed
  Like riot of silver lights,
  And the gold of the knight's good banner
  Still waved on a castle wall.
  .    .    .    .    .    .    .
  A horse,
  Blowing, staggering, bloody thing,
  Forgotten at foot of castle wall.
  A horse
  Dead at foot of castle wall.




  Forth went the candid man
  And spoke freely to the wind--
  When he looked about him he was in a far
     strange country.

  Forth went the candid man
  And spoke freely to the stars--
  Yellow light tore sight from his eye.

  "My good fool," said a learned bystander,
  "Your operations are mad."

  "You are too candid," cried the candid man.
  And when his stick left the head of the
     learned bystander
  It was two sticks.




  You tell me this is God?
  I tell you this is a printed list,
  A burning candle and an ass.




  On the desert
  A silence from the moon's deepest
     valley.
  Fire rays fall athwart the robes
  Of hooded men, squat and dumb.
  Before them, a woman
  Moves to the blowing of shrill whistles
  And distant thunder of drums,
  While mystic things, sinuous, dull with
      terrible color,
  Sleepily fondle her body
  Or move at her will, swishing stealthily over
     the sand.
  The snakes whisper softly;
  The whispering, whispering snakes,
  Dreaming and swaying and staring,
  But always whispering, softly whispering.
  The wind streams from the lone reaches
  Of Arabia, solemn with night,
  And the wild fire makes shimmer of blood
  Over the robes of the hooded men
  Squat and dumb.

  Bands of moving bronze, emerald, yellow,
  Circle the throat and arms of her,
  And over the sands serpents move warily
  Slow, menacing and submissive,
  Swinging to the whistles and drums,
  The whispering, whispering snakes,
  Dreaming and swaying and staring,
  But always whispering, softly whispering.
  The dignity of the accursed;
  The glory of slavery, despair, death,
  Is in the dance of the whispering snakes.




  A newspaper is a collection of half-injustices
  Which, bawled by boys from mile to mile,
  Spreads its curious opinion
  To a million merciful and sneering men,
  While families cuddle the joys of the fireside
  When spurred by tale of dire lone agony.
  A newspaper is a court
  Where every one is kindly and unfairly tried
  By a squalor of honest men.
  A newspaper is a market
  Where wisdom sells its freedom
  And melons are crowned by the crowd.
  A newspaper is a game
  Where his error scores the player victory
  While another's skill wins death.
  A newspaper is a symbol;
  It is fetless life's chronical,
  A collection of loud tales
  Concentrating eternal stupidities,
  That in remote ages lived unhaltered,
  Roaming through a fenceless world.




  The wayfarer,
  Perceiving the pathway to truth,
  Was struck with astonishment.
  It was thickly grown with weeds.
  "Ha," he said,
  "I see that none has passed here
  "In a long time."
  Later he saw that each weed
  Was a singular knife.
  "Well," he mumbled at last,
  "Doubtless there are other roads."




  A slant of sun on dull brown walls,
  A forgotten sky of bashful blue.

  Toward God a mighty hymn,
  A song of collisions and cries,
  Rumbling wheels, hoof-beats, bells,
  Welcomes, farewells, love-calls, final moans,
  Voices of joy, idiocy, warning, despair,
  The unknown appeals of brutes,
  The chanting of flowers,
  The screams of cut trees,
  The senseless babble of hens and wise men--
  A cluttered incoherency that says at the
      stars;
  "O God, save us!"




  Once a man clambering to the housetops
  Appealed to the heavens.
  With a strong voice he called to the deaf
      spheres;
  A warrior's shout he raised to the suns.
  Lo, at last, there was a dot on the clouds,
  And--at last and at last--
  --God--the sky was filled with armies.




  There was a man with tongue of wood
  Who essayed to sing,
  And in truth it was lamentable.
  But there was one who heard
  The clip-clapper of this tongue of wood
  And knew what the man
  Wished to sing,
  And with that the singer was content.




  The successful man has thrust himself
  Through the water of the years,
  Reeking wet with mistakes,--
  Bloody mistakes;
  Slimed with victories over the lesser,
  A figure thankful on the shore of money.
  Then, with the bones of fools
  He buys silken banners
  Limned with his triumphant face;
  With the skins of wise men
  He buys the trivial bows of all.
  Flesh painted with marrow
  Contributes a coverlet,
  A coverlet for his contented slumber.
  In guiltless ignorance, in ignorant guilt,
  He delivered his secrets to the riven multitude.
    "Thus I defended: Thus I wrought."
  Complacent, smiling,
  He stands heavily on the dead.
  Erect on a pillar of skulls
  He declaims his trampling of babes;
  Smirking, fat, dripping,
  He makes speech in guiltless ignorance,
  Innocence.




  In the night
  Grey heavy clouds muffled the valleys,
  And the peaks looked toward God alone.
     "O Master that movest the wind with a
       finger,
     "Humble, idle, futile peaks are we.
     "Grant that we may run swiftly across
        the world
     "To huddle in worship at Thy feet."

  In the morning
  A noise of men at work came the clear blue miles,
  And the little black cities were apparent.
     "O Master that knowest the meaning of raindrops,
     "Humble, idle, futile peaks are we.
     "Give voice to us, we pray, O Lord,
     "That we may sing Thy goodness to the sun."
  In the evening
  The far valleys were sprinkled with tiny lights.
    "O Master,
    "Thou that knowest the value of kings and birds,
    "Thou hast made us humble, idle, futile peaks.
    "Thous only needest eternal patience;
    "We bow to Thy wisdom, O Lord--
    "Humble, idle, futile peaks."

  In the night
  Grey heavy clouds muffles the valleys,
  And the peaks looked toward God alone.



  The chatter of a death-demon from a tree-top.

  Blood--blood and torn grass--
  Had marked the rise of his agony--
  This lone hunter.
  The grey-green woods impassive
  Had watched the threshing of his limbs.

  A canoe with flashing paddle,
  A girl with soft searching eyes,
  A call: "John!"
  .    .    .    .    .    .    .
  Come, arise, hunter!
  Can you not hear?

  The chatter of a death-demon from a tree-
     top.



  The impact of a dollar upon the heart
      Smiles warm red light,
  Sweeping from the hearth rosily upon the
      white table,
  With the hanging cool velvet shadows
  Moving softly upon the door.

  The impact of a million dollars
  Is a crash of flunkys,
  And yawning emblems of Persia
  Cheeked against oak, France and a sabre,
  The outcry of old beauty
  Whored by pimping merchants
  To submission before wine and chatter.
  Silly rich peasants stamp the carpets of men,
  Dead men who dreamed fragrance and light
  Into their woof, their lives;
  The rug of an honest bear
  Under the feet of a cryptic slave
  Who speaks always of baubles,
  Forgetting state, multitude, work, and state,
  Champing and mouthing of hats,
  Making ratful squeak of hats,
  Hats.



  A man said to the universe:
     "Sir, I exist!"
  "However," replied the universe,
  "The fact has not created in me
  "A sense of obligation."



  When the prophet, a complacent fat
     man,
  Arrived at the mountain-top,
  He cried: "Woe to my knowledge!
  "I intended to see good white lands
  "And bad black lands,
  "But the scene is grey."



  There was a land where lived no
    violets.
  A traveller at once demanded: "Why?"
  The people told him:
  "Once the violets of this place spoke thus:
  "'Until some woman freely give her lover
  "'To another woman
  "'We will fight in bloody scuffle.'"
  Sadly the people added:
  "There are no violets here."



  There was one I met upon the road
  Who looked at me with kind eyes.
  He said: "Show me of your wares."
  And I did,
  Holding forth one,
  He said: "It is a sin."
  Then I held forth another.
  He said: "It is a sin."
  Then I held forth another.
  He said: "It is a sin."
  And so to the end.
  Always He said: "It is a sin."
  At last, I cried out:
  "But I have non other."
  He looked at me
  With kinder eyes.
  "Poor soul," he said.



  Aye, workman, make me a dream,
  A dream for my love.
  Cunningly weave sunlight,
  Breezes, and flowers.
  Let it be of the cloth of meadows.
  And--good workman--
  And let there be a man walking thereon.



  Each small gleam was a voice,
  A lantern voice--
  In little songs of carmine, violet, green, gold.
  A chorus of colors came over the water;
  The wondrous leaf-shadow no longer wavered,
  No pines crooned on the hills,
  The blue night was elsewhere a silence,
  When the chorus of colors came over the
       water,
  Little songs of carmine, violet, green, gold.

  Small glowing pebbles
  Thrown on the dark plane of evening
  Sing good ballads of God
  And eternity, with soul's rest.
  Little priests, little holy fathers,
  None can doubt the truth of hour hymning.
  When the marvellous chorus comes over the
       water,
  Songs of carmine, violet, green, gold.



  The trees in the garden rained flowers.
  Children ran there joyously.
  They gathered the flowers
  Each to himself.
  Now there were some
  Who gathered great heaps--
  Having opportunity and skill--
  Until, behold, only chance blossoms
  Remained for the feeble.
  Then a little spindling tutor
  Ran importantly to the father, crying:
  "Pray, come hither!
  "See this unjust thing in your garden!"
  But when the father had surveyed,
  He admonished the tutor:
  "Not so, small sage!
  "This thing is just.
  "For, look you,
  "Are not they who possess the flowers
  "Stronger, bolder, shrewder
  "Than they who have none?
  "Why should the strong--
  "The beautiful strong--
  "Why should they not have the flowers?

  Upon reflection, the tutor bowed to the
       ground.
  "My lord," he said,
  "The stars are displaced
  "By this towering wisdom."




  INTRIGUE

  Thou art my love,
  And thou art the peace of sundown
  When the blue shadows soothe,
  And the grasses and the leaves sleep
  To the song of the little brooks,
  Woe is me.

  Thou art my love,
  And thou art a strorm
  That breaks black in the sky,
  And, sweeping headlong,
  Drenches and cowers each tree,
  And at the panting end
  There is no sound
  Save the melancholy cry of a single owl--
  Woe is me!

  Thou are my love,
  And thou art a tinsel thing,
  And I in my play
  Broke thee easily,
  And from the little fragments
  Arose my long sorrow--
  Woe is me.

  Thou art my love,
  And thou art a wary violet,
  Drooping from sun-caresses,
  Answering mine carelessly--
  Woe is me.

  Thou art my love,
  And thou art the ashes of other men's love,
  And I bury my face in these ashes,
  And I love them--
  Woe is me.

  Thou art my love,
  And thou art the beard
  On another man's face--
  Woe is me.

  Thou art my love,
  And thou art a temple,
  And in this temple is an altar,
  And on this altar is my heart--
  Woe is me.

  Thou art my love,
  And thou art a wretch.
  Let these sacred love-lies choke thee,
  From I am come to where I know your lies
     as truth
  And you truth as lies--
  Woe is me.

  Thou art my love,
  And thou art a priestess,
  And in they hand is a bloody dagger,
  And my doom comes to me surely--
  Woe is me.

  Thou art my love,
  And thou art a skull with ruby eyes,
  And I love thee--
  Woe is me.

  Thou art my love,
  And I doubt thee.
  And if peace came with thy murder
  Then would I murder--
  Woe is me.

  Thou art my love,
  And thou art death,
  Aye, thou art death
  Black and yet black,
  But I love thee,
  I love thee--
  Woe, welcome woe, to me.




  Love, forgive me if I wish you grief,
  For in your grief
  You huddle to my breast,
  And for it
  Would I pay the price of your grief.

  You walk among men
  And all men do not surrender,
  And thus I understand
  That love reaches his hand
  In mercy to me.

  He had your picture in his room,
  A scurvy traitor picture,
  And he smiled
  --Merely a fat complacence of men who
     know fine women--
  And thus I divided with him
  A part of my love.

  Fool, not to know that thy little shoe
  Can make men weep!
  --Some men weep.
  I weep and I gnash,
  And I love the little shoe,
  The little, little shoe.

  God give me medals,
  God give me loud honors,
  That I may strut before you, sweetheart,
  And be worthy of--
  The love I bear you.

  Now let me crunch you
  With full weight of affrighted love.
  I doubted you
  --I doubted you--
  And in this short doubting
  My love grew like a genie
  For my further undoing.

  Beware of my friends,
  Be not in speech too civil,
  For in all courtesy
  My weak heart sees spectres,
  Mists of desire
  Arising from the lips of my chosen;
  Be not civil.

  The flower I gave thee once
  Was incident to a stride,
  A detail of a gesture,
  But search those pale petals
  And see engraven thereon
  A record of my intention.




  Ah, God, the way your little finger moved,
  As you thrust a bare arm backward
  And made play with your hair
  And a comb, a silly gilt comb
  --Ah, God--that I should suffer
  Because of the way a little finger moved.




  Once I saw thee idly rocking
  --Idly rocking--
  And chattering girlishly to other girls,
  Bell-voiced, happy,
  Careless with the stout heart of unscarred
      womanhood,
  And life to thee was all light melody.
  I thought of the great storms of love as I
      knew it,
  Torn, miserable, and ashamed of my open
      sorrow,
  I thought of the thunders that lived in my
      head,
  And I wish to be an ogre,
  And hale and haul my beloved to a castle,
  And make her mourn with my mourning.




  Tell me why, behind thee,
  I see always the shadow of another lover?
  Is it real,
  Or is this the thrice damned memory of a
       better happiness?
  Plague on him if he be dead,
  Plague on him if he be alive--
  A swinish numskull
  To intrude his shade
  Always between me and my peace!




  And yet I have seen thee happy with me.
  I am no fool
  To poll stupidly into iron.
  I have heard your quick breaths
  And seen your arms writhe toward me;
  At those times
  --God help us--
  I was impelled to be a grand knight,
  And swagger and snap my fingers,
  And explain my mind finely.
  Oh, lost sweetheart,
  I would that I had not been a grand knight.
  I said: "Sweetheart."
  Thou said'st: "Sweetheart."
  And we preserved an admirable mimicry
  Without heeding the drip of the blood
  From my heart.




  I heard thee laugh,
  And in this merriment
  I defined the measure of my pain;
  I knew that I was alone,
  Alone with love,
  Poor shivering love,
  And he, little sprite,
  Came to watch with me,
  And at midnight,
  We were like two creatures by a dead camp-fire.




  I wonder if sometimes in the dusk,
  When the brave lights that gild thy
     evenings
  Have not yet been touched with flame,
  I wonder if sometimes in the dusk
  Thou rememberest a time,
  A time when thou loved me
  And our love was to thee thy all?
  Is the memory rubbish now?
  An old gown
  Worn in an age of other fashions?
  Woe is me, oh, lost one,
  For that love is now to me
  A supernal dream,
  White, white, white with many suns.




  Love met me at noonday,
  --Reckless imp,
  To leave his shaded nights
  And brave the glare,--
  And I saw him then plainly
  For a bungler,
  A stupid, simpering, eyeless bungler,
  Breaking the hearts of brave people
  As the snivelling idiot-boy cracks his bowl,
  And I cursed him,
  Cursed him to and fro, back and forth,
  Into all the silly mazes of his mind,
  But in the end
  He laughed and pointed to my breast,
  Where a heart still beat for thee, beloved.




  I have seen thy face aflame
  For love of me,
  Thy fair arms go mad,
  Thy lips tremble and mutter and rave.
  And--surely--
  This should leave a man content?
  Thou lovest not me now,
  But thou didst love me,
  And in loving me once
  Thou gavest me an eternal privilege,
  For I can think of thee.

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
