Of those I often have contact with 4 I remember one, but don?t recognize ten. I met Master Cheng only recently, when talking with him, outstanding talent shows. My ears and eyes are opened by his graciousness, 8 I strongly feel that it gets through to my understanding. After a thousand years I have found my Bao Shu,2 I have achieved something by his willingness to befriend me. Purpose concentrated, an old cypress green, 12 your sense of right stirs a long serpent hibernating.3 If I could see this person often, it would console my weeping, hair hanging white. When you announced your departure so soon, 16 a hundred cares again beset me. Within I am embarrassed that my chimney is not blackened,4 but you have brought fine delicacies to help out. On a white string you carry a long fish, 20 sapphire ale is accompanied by jade grains of rice. 1 Original note: ?Cheng brought ale and food to meet me and take his leave? ?? ??????. 2 Guan Zhong lived in poverty, but Bao Shu treated him very well; and when Bao entered the service of the Count Huan of Qi, he recommended Guan Zhong. Guan Zhong eventually became Duke Huan?s chief minister. 3 This is a figure from the Yi: the dragon and serpent hibernate to protect themselves. 4 I have no wood for a fire to prepare a meal for you.

Burning navel, the fort at Mei ruined,1 4 holding his standard, the Han officer returned.2 White hair, a thousand stalks of snow. loyal heart, one square inch of ash.3 Parted, we passed through places of dying, 8 suddenly we are climbing a terrace and telling all. Once again we face Qin?s pipes playing,4 together we come to visit Ruan?s house.5 1 When Dong Zhuo (d. 192) held power, he built a fort at Mei with treasures and provisions to last thirty years. Later, when he was killed in Chang?an, the soldiers lit his navel; he was so fat that the fire burned for several days. This may refer to the death of An Lushan, also notoriously fat. 2 *Su Wu. This refers to Zheng Qian, who had been taken to Luoyang by An Lushan?s�troops; according to Du Fu, Zheng remained loyal (?holding his standard? also means ?keeping his integrity?), though that was not the verdict of�the court. 3 That is, the heart has burned away with cares. 4 *Xiaoshi. This refers to Consort Zheng; imperial son-in-laws were commonly compared to Xiaoshi. 5 Ruan Xian was *Ruan Ji?s nephew; Ruan Ji lived on the south side of the street, while Ruan Xian lived on the north side.

Lush trees led me on as I went, joined mountains suddenly appeared to my gaze. Close friends were shocked that, gaunt and old, 8 I had, in bitter hardship, come from among the rebels. II Sad thoughts on evenings with Hu fifes, a dismal spring in the parks of Han.2 A return alive is what happened today, 4 for a while I had been someone on back roads. When I first saw the insignia of the Metropolitan Commandant,3 the aura over Nanyang was already renewed.4 1 That is, when he was in Chang?an the word was that no one could get through rebel-held territory to Qiyang, near which was Suzong?s temporary capital. 2 That is, in Chang?an. 3 This was the title held by Guangwudi, the restoration emperor who founded the Eastern Han, before he became emperor. 4 Nanyang was Guangwudi?s native place.

This morning the dynastic altars of Han 8 will begin a new count: the Restoration years. In early summer of 757 Du Fu escaped from the rebel-held capital and made his way west to Fengxiang, where Suzong had set up court. There he was appointed a Reminder, an official who stayed close to the ruler and ?reminded? him of important issues he had overlooked. At the time Suzong was sending out his own officials to key positions in the region he controlled. 5.6 Seeing Off Attendant Censor Fan (23) on his Way to a Post as Administrative Assistant in Hanzhong The Bow that overawes could not be strung,2 since then there have been no peaceful years.

The Han?s bleak windswept waters are clear,2 12 a remote route for tax from the Huai and lakes. Men on missions are as many as scattered stars, the royal net of rule is still like banner tassels attached.3 The Earl of the South is worthy in handling matters,4 16 you will go to where he stands and chats.5 You full well understand tracking the Seven Luminaries, your hand marks out the Grand Army?s dispositions. Your apprehension is as bright as ice and snow, 20 your military sharpness speeds like thunder. In headquarters you were allowed to be a remonstrating official; such is unprecedented in the court.

Right now we are in times of difficulty, 28 and we truly depend on long-range plans. 1 This refers either to the recall of the northwestern armies or to Suzong?s Uighur allies. 2 Probably referring to the appointment of Du Fu?s friend Li Yu as Prince of Hanzhong. Since imperial tax revenues from the lower Yangzi could no longer be sent up the Grand Canal to the Yellow River, the route up the Han River through Hanzhong was essential. 3 ?Attached tassels,? zhuiliu ??, was an old figure for the way the feudal lords were attached to the ruler. The inverted form used here, liuzhui ??, was used in Liu Kun?s (271?318) famous memorial during the breakup of the Western Jin: ?The peril of the ruling house is something like banner tassels attached? ?????? ??. This seems to be Du Fu?s sense here, particularly in the context of the more tightly woven ?net? of imperial rule. 4 This was Li Yu, raised from Duke of Longxi to Prince of Hanzhong. 5 Suggesting engagement in his duties. 6 Because he is so busy.

The one who stays is gloomy in the vastness, and the traveler is now far in the distance. I pace about, sad at this parting of the living, 36 cramped up, old in my generation. They sang of people left over from the time of Tao and Tang,2 the Later Han continued a line of emperors.3 Distressed that I don?t look like one to restore the dynasty, 40 I would just go off from this point on. Not a few of Du Fu?s poems from this period are seeing such men off as they went to take up their posts. In poetic terms Du Fu gives the background of the situation, explains why the post is a critical one in terms of the current military situation, and gives the recipient a sense that what he is doing is important. He often does this in his later poetry as well, but the clarity of the problems in the current political crisis gives these poems an edge. In peaceful times to be sent from the imperial presence to a post in the provinces would be a cause for resentment?even though in this case there was probably no diminishment in his grade in the civil service. Du Fu explains why this is a mark of imperial confidence in the recipient?s abilities and how crucial the post is?ensuring the transport of tax revenues to the throne. 1 The sleeve was grasped in parting. 2 This refers to the famous visit of the Prince of Wu to Lu, recounted in the Zuo Tradition (Xiang 29). The prince listened to the Classic of Poetry, commenting on each section. His response to the Airs of Tang was that ?their brooding was deep,? and that they must be ?people left over from Tao and Tang.? Tao and Tang were the fiefs of Yao, hence referring to that sage-king. The allusion is based on ?longing for Tang,? as both Yao and the current dynasty. 3 That is, as the Eastern Han continued the dynasty after the usurpation of Wang Mang, so the Tang will continue after the An Lushan Rebellion.

Although your stature is small, 8 your mature energy stretches across the nine regions. You roused yourself on occasion of the troubles, opened your eyes wide and took a look at the enemy.

It holds the road west to the Ruo River, 16 it guards the borders of Fuhan Commandery to the south. In the age of peace, this land was the shame of its officers because of banditry.

Old Qiang there wear boots of boar-hide,4 young Qiang wear capes of blue rhino skin. Bugles are blown facing the Cave of the Moon,5 32 in the gray mountains the banners are mournful. The birds are startled, coming out from dead trees, dragons rage and rise up in old tarns. Since ancient days, an uninhabited realm, 36 in this present age, pikes and lances are brandished. Painful, indeed, that a man of letters and learning, should gallop those wooded hills, stirred to rage. On the Central Plain they are fighting now, 40 what means will we have to meet again?

This summer, as plants and trees grew tall, 4 I escaped and got to flee west. In hemp sandals I met the Son of Heaven, both elbows showed through the sleeves of my clothes. The court had sympathy that I had made it alive, 8 old friends were pained at how old and ugly I had become. With tears I received the Reminder?s post, our lord?s grace was great for those who fled. Though I could have gone off to my ramshackle gate,1 12 I could not bring myself to mention it right then. I sent a letter asking of Three Rivers,2 not knowing whether my family survived.

Shedding tears, you now cast down your brush,7 and at once grasp your saddle, lamenting the times. 1 Suzong?s son, Li Chu, the Prince of Guangping, was made supreme commander. ?Tuning the pitch-pipes? is restoring political order. 2 Presumably anger at the rebel occupation of the capital. 3 With the Tibetans. 4 The Btsan-po was the term for the ruler of Tibet. 5 Nan Juchuan, the head of the mission to Tibet. 6 Du Fu refers to Yang in terms of the Han writer *Yang Xiong (Ziyun). 7 ?Casting down one?s brush? refers to giving up a scholar?s role for a military position, as Ban Chao did when he went to serve in the army in the Eastern Han.

Since the dynasty?s altars of Earth and Grain are as they are right now, 4 who but you, sir, by martial measures can quell ruin and rebellion? The thousand officials at Fengxiang for now are all well fed, but no more can their clothes be light and their horses sleek. Of the courtiers in gowns of blue, the one in the hardest straits2 8 is this white-haired Reminder going home on foot. Friendships formed in human life take no account of age, in considering association why need one put sameness of temper first? In the mountains my wife and children weep facing the heavens, 12 from your stables I need the wind-chasing brown charger. The minister Fang Guan, whose military ineptness had led to the defeat of�the imperial army at Chentao and Changban, fell from Suzong?s favor. Du Fu was a friend and strong supporter of Fang Guan, and he spoke up in Fang Guan?s defense, which weakened Du Fu?s own position at court. This speaks well of Du Fu?s loyalty to friends, but very poorly of his judgment in political matters. Du Fu asked Suzong to ?ignore small things and note greater things.? Losing a very large imperial army to a scholar?s folly is hard to forgive as a ?small thing.? Guo Ziyi, by contrast, lost many battles and, deservedly, retained the emperor?s support. Fang Guan?s usefulness in the crisis was a delusion that Suzong could not afford to entertain. Du�Fu?s politically stupid protest was initially forgiven on the grounds that one should not stifle protest. It was forgiven but not forgotten. Du Fu never 1 Original note: ?Presented to Li [Siye], Lord Specially Advanced; composed on the�way from Fengxiang to Fuzhou, my route passing through Binzhou? ??? ??????????????. 2 The blue gown is simple garb of commoners or students.

In this context Du Fu asked for and was granted permission to visit his family in Fuzhou, several hundred miles from Fengxiang. According to the original note, this poem was composed in Binzhou, after Du Fu had gone about one-third of the way on foot (and no doubt realized how difficult it would have been to make the entire journey on foot). Since horses had all been requisitioned for military use, Du Fu wrote the poem to General Li Siye, asking to borrow a horse. 5.22 Jiucheng Palace1 I went into gray-green mountains a hundred leagues, the cliff was broken, like a mortar. This layered palace lies against whirling gusts, 4 looming at the mouth of a hole in the earth. Gods were placed to support its rafters and beams, they bored into azure foliage to open doors and windows. The sunlit southern slopes produce numinous mushrooms; 8 on shadowy north slope rest Oxherd and Dipper Fanning out, tall pines hang inverted, jutting jagged, weird rocks rush. Mournful gibbons give a single cry, 12 and the traveler?s tears gush in woods and bog. Ungoverned indeed?that Sui emperor, constructing this, now fallen and rotting. Had he then not caused his domain to be destroyed, 16 how could it have become the possession of the mighty Tang? Even though there are no recent additions or repairs, they still assign an officer to guard it. 1 Jiucheng Palace, so called because it was built on nine levels on a mountain, was originally the Renshou Palace of the Sui. It was refurbished in the reign of Taizong and served as a summer palace during his reign and that of his successor Gaozong.

Our divine king holds a winter hunt on Mount Taibai,3 24 I halt my horse and still scratch my head. 5.23 Yuhua Palace4 The stream valley turns, the wind steady in the pines, a gray rat scuttles under ancient tiles. I know not what royal palace this was, 4 edifice abandoned beneath the sheer cliff. In shadowy chambers ghost-fires are green,5 mournful rivulets pour over broken roadways. The myriad vents are the true ocarinas,6 8 autumn colors are at their most brisk and aloof. Its fair women have become the brown earth, still more, their artifice of powder and mascara. Waiting on the golden carriage back then, 12 of the former things there are only the stone horses. Cares come, I smooth down the grass and sit, sing out loud, tears filling my open hands. 1 This refers to the expedition of Zhou King Mu to meet the Queen Mother of the West, who feasted him at Alabaster Pool in the Kunlun Mountains. 2 That is, the extravagance of Sui Yangdi can been seen in the ornament of the ruins, which serve as evidence of why the Sui fell. 3 The ?hunt? was a euphemism for an emperor in flight from his capital. Mount Taibai was close to Fengxiang, Suzong?s temporary capital. 4 Yuhua Palace had been constructed in 647 for Taizong as a summer palace to escape the heat of Chang?an. It was later made a temple, and was clearly abandoned by the time Du Fu saw it. 5 These are will-o-the-wisps. 6 The ?myriad vents,? wanlai ??, are those described in Zhuangzi, the holes on the earth whose sounds are the piping of Nature. These are opposed to the ?ocarinas,? the sheng and yu, reed organs of a Chinese orchestra. Unauthenticated Download Date | 10/1/17 7:36 AM 328 ???? ?????? 16 ?????? 5.24?26 ????

Four or five old men ask me about my long travels afar. Each has brought something in hand, 8 and we tip the jars, both the thick and the clear. ?Don?t refuse our ale for being too thin? there is no one to plow the millet lands.

In these times we have met with great affliction, free days are few in court or countryside. I consider the undue grant of special grace, 8 how an edict permitted return to my humble home. I went to the palace gates to take my leave, shaken with awe, it was long ere I could go. Though I lack the qualities for offering criticism, 12 I feared lest my ruler overlook some matter. My ruler is true lord of the Restoration, sedulously striving indeed to manage affairs. The revolt of the eastern Hu is not over,3 16 and your subject Du Fu was stung with fury. 1 Original note: ?Composed when I had reached Fengxiang, and a personal edict from the emperor released me to go to Fuzhou? ???????????. 2 This is August 20, 757. The calendar required the adjustment of an additional eighth month (a ?lesser? eighth month) added before the eighth month proper. 3 That is, of An Lushan and Shi Siming.

Heaven and Earth bear wounds and scars, 20 when will our misery ever cease? With slow steps I traversed the field paths, the smoke of hearths, far and faint in the gloom. Those I met had mostly suffered wounds, 24 they groaned and kept on streaming with blood. I turned my head back to Fengxiang County,1 late in the day its banners appeared and faded from view. I climbed the folds of cold mountains ahead, 28 often finding watering holes for my horse. I entered Bin?s moor down at the base of the ground, the Jing?s waters churned through its midst. Fierce tigers stood before me, 32 the gray slopes split when they roared. From chrysanthemums hung this autumn?s blooms, the rock bore the ruts of ancient carts. The blue clouds stirred high spirits, 36 experiences in seclusion may still be enjoyed. Mountain berries in many tiny bits grew in stretches mixed with chestnut oaks. Some were red like cinnabar pebbles, 40 others, black like spots of lacquer. 1 Fengxiang was the seat of the restoration government where Suzong held court.

I thought of Peach Blossom Spring, so remote,1 44 increasing sighs over the blunders of my life. From the rises I gazed to Fu?s Altar,2 which emerged and sank away as I crossed valley and cliff. I had already gone on to the shores of a stream, 48 and my servant was still in the tips of the trees.3 Owls screeched in the brown mulberry trees, ground squirrels folded hands by their scattered dens. In the depths of night I passed through a battlefield, 52 where the cold moon shone on white bones. An army of a million at Tong Pass? back then they scattered so swiftly!4 In consequence half the folk of Qin 56 were destroyed and made into non-human things.5 What?s more I fell into the dust of the Hu, coming home, my hair is all streaked with gray. A year has passed, and I reach my thatched cottage,6 60 wife and children?s clothes patched in a hundred places. Stirred to weeping, the sound of pines replies, and mournful streams join our secret sobs. The son whom I always have doted on, 64 his complexion is whiter than snow. 1 *Peach Blossom Spring. 2 Fu?s Altar, by legend constructed by Duke Wen of Qin, was a mound that marked Fuzhou, where Du Fu?s family was located. 3 That is, the servant is behind him, higher up the slope. 4 This refers to the disastrous defeat of the hastily assembled imperial army outside of Tong Pass. 5 That is, ghosts, not having been buried with the proper ceremonies. 6 That is, a year since he left his family in Fuzhou and went back to Chang?an, at the point when it fell to An Lushan?s forces.

An ocean scene with its waves torn, a former embroidery, its sequence of panels shifted.1 Tianwu and the Purple Phoenix2 72 were upside down on their short tunics. I, the old man, was feeling bad and lay several days with vomiting and diarrhea. Of course I had money in my purse 76 to save you from shivering in the cold. I also undid packets of powder and mascara, sheets and blankets were amply arrayed. A light returned to my gaunt wife?s face, 80 and the innocent girls combed their own hair. They imitated their mother in everything, with morning make-up smeared on liberally. After some time they put on rouge 84 and painted wide brows helter-skelter. Back alive, I face these children and almost forget my hunger and thirst. Asking what happened, scrambling to pull my whiskers 88 who could glare or scold them just then? 1 That is, an old embroidery with a coherent sequence of scenes has been cut up into pieces for the girls? clothes. 2 Tianwu was an ocean god.

I look up and observe Heaven?s aspect changing, 96 sensing how baleful vapors clear all around. From the Northwest comes a shadowy wind,1 somberly following the Uighurs. Their king wants them to serve and aid, 100 by custom they excel in the cavalry charge. They have sent us five thousand troops, and driven along ten thousand horses. Of this sort a few are valuable,2 104 all the world admires their resolute bravery. They always use ?hawk-bounders,?3 that smash the enemy swifter than an arrow. His Highness?s heart prefers to wait, doing nothing, 108 all spirit is virtually lost in current policy debates. Luoyang can be taken as easily as pointing to the palm,4 the Western Capital is not even worth seizing. The Imperial Army begs to strike deeply, 112 their stored up sharpness should be unleashed en masse. 1 This is the emanation of Suzong?s Uighur allies. 2 This can be read politely (?even a few are valuable?) or less politely (?the fewer the better.?) 3 Xiao Difei suggests that this refers to the cavalry. 4 ?Pointing to the palm? is a set phrase for obviousness or ease.

How can the Hu?s fated span last long?? 120 it is not fitting that Imperial Rule be cut off. I think back to when the panic first began, what happened was different from all precedent. The corrupt minister at last was chopped to mince,4 124 and his evil partners were then swept away. We would never have heard of Xia or Yin?s decline had they executed Bao and Da midway.5 Zhou and Han achieved a second rising? 128 Xuan and Guang were truly discerning and wise.6 Undaunted was General Chen Xuanli,7 with spear and axe, he exercised loyal ardor. Were it not for you, the people would all be gone, 132 yet the dynasty still lives unto this day. 1 Qingzhou and Xuzhou were two prefectures in the east, deep in An Lushan?s territory. 2 Heng and Jie are mountains in the northeast. 3 ?Stern deadliness,? susha ??, is an attribute of autumn, the season of war and punishment. The qi (?atmosphere?) is both the weather and the spiritual force of the season. 4 The reference is to Yang Guozhong. 5 Daji ?? was the consort of Zhou, the last Shang king. To Da and Bao were attributed the fall of the Shang ( Yin) and Western Zhou respectively. The analogy here is clearly to Lady Yang the Noble Consort, who, in contrast, was ordered to commit suicide, by which, to Du Fu?s mind, the dynasty was saved. 6 The references are to King Xuan, who restored the Western Zhou?s power, and to Guangwudi, the founder of the Eastern Han.

Truly divinity hangs about the imperial tombs, rites of sweeping and sprinkling will not be omitted. Glorious is the legacy of Taizong? 140 what he established is exceedingly vast and enduring. 5.28 Reaching Zhaoling on My Travels3 Olden ways were worn down by undistinguished rulers, a host of heroes called the Lone Man to account.4 Prophecies pointed to one of dragon and phoenix nature,5 4 his might settled the capital with its tigers and jackals.6 His blood relations revered the ?Canon of Yao,?7 in divine achievement he assisted in ?The Plan of Yu.?8 Wind and clouds followed the fleetest feet,9 8 sun and moon continued on the high streets of Heaven. In cultural matters he often followed antiquity,10 half of his court were old Confucian scholars. 1 Datong Palace was a hall in the Tang palace compound of Chang?an. White Beast Hall is properly White Tiger Hall, renamed because of the taboo on Tang Taizu?s name. This was a hall (and gate) in the Han palace; Han palace names were liberally transferred to places in the Tang palace. 2 The kingfisher feathers mark the imperial standards and would be a sign of the emperor?s return to Chang?an. 3 Zhaoling was the tomb of Taizong. 4 The ?Lone Man? is the emperor, in this case, Sui Yangdi. 5 Li Shimin, Taizong. 6 Chang?an. 7 In the ?Canon of Yao? in the Classic of Documents, Yao yields the throne to Shun, and Shun to Yu. This refers to Taizong?s father Li Yuan abdicating to Taizong. 8 The ?Plan of Yu? in the Classic of Documents, praises the achievements of Yu. 9 The ?fleetest feet? is Taizong as a fine horse. The clouds follow the dragon, and the wind follows the tiger, referring to Taizong?s ?dragon and tiger? qualities. 10 Ritual and music, sometimes particularly involving ceremonial robes.

Vast distance now from the day he founded the dynasty, 24 my flowing resentment fills the folds of the mountains. 5.29 Once Again on Passing by Zhaoling In those dark beginnings a hero arose, the imperial succession came with chants and songs.

The night was deep on Pengya road, 4 the moon shone on Whitewater Mountain. The whole household had traveled long on foot, and most of those we met were shamelessly unfeeling. Valley birds droned here and there, 8 we saw no travelers going back the way we came. My baby daughter bit at me in her hunger, I feared tigers and wolves would hear her cries. I held her to my chest and covered her mouth, 12 she twisted and turned, her voice even more upset. My little son pretended he knew what to do, he kept seeking bitter plums to eat. 1 Auspicious clouds.

Wild fruits served as our provisions, low branches became the beams of our roof. Early we walked through water on rocks, 24 at dusk we would stay at hearth-smoke seen on the horizon. We remained for a while in Tongjia Swamp, about to go through Luzi Barrier. Among my old friends there was one Steward Sun, 28 whose high sense of right touched tiered clouds. He welcomed us as night?s blackness fell, lit lanterns and opened his gates. He warmed waters to bathe our feet, 32 and cut paper streamers to call back our souls. After this he brought in his wife and children, whose tears streamed down on seeing us. All my brood was sleeping soundly, 36 he woke them and graced them with a meal.

Who else would be willing in such troubled times to show his good heart so openly? Since we parted a full year has run its course, 44 and the Hu still work our ruin. When shall I ever have the wings to fly off and land before you? In the ninth month the Crown Prince, later Daizong, led an imperial army, along with his Uighur contingent, to the west of Chang?an, ready to give battle. A rebel counterattack was foiled by the Uighurs, and the victorious imperial army recovered Chang?an. 5.31 Happy at the News that the Imperial Army is Already at the Edge of �Rebel Territory: Twenty Couplets The Hu barbarians hide away in the capital district, the imperial army surrounds the rebel moats. Fish in a kettle, still hanging on to their last breaths, 4 ants in their hole, where will they flee? In the tent palace black headgear lines up,1 at headquarters gate white gowns shine.2 One should clear the imperial way in Qin?s mountains, 8 our banners will enter the parks of Han. His road will avoid those of sheep-gut perils,3 the pheasant-tail fans raised high like clouds across the sky.4 On the five plains the forts will lie empty, 12 the wind-blown billows will dissipate on the eight rivers.5 1 The officials at Suzong?s temporary headquarters. 2 The Uighur cavalry brought to help. 3 That is, Suzong will come directly and openly to the capital, perhaps in contrast to his father Xuanzong?s tortuous route in flight to Chengdu. 4 The pheasant tail fans were part of the imperial regalia. 5 That is, the region around Chang?an will be peaceful.

The high command goes to the dragon spawn,2 the Minister of Works clasps the ?Leopard Bowcase.?3 The vanguard shows the standards of Su Wu,4 20 the general of the left has L� Qian?s sword.5 The soldiers? aura turns back birds in flight, repute of their awe makes the huge turtle dive underwater. Pike and steel lance reveal the color of snow, 24 bow and arrow aim at the wisp in autumn.6 In the course of fate troubles now end, in the cycles we again meet a time of harmony. Who says that their poison will linger on?? 28 we already rinsing the stench away. The Cinnabar Courtyard is near to royal concerns, moving swift as spirits, the imperial guard is firm. Those of Huamen have bounded over remote deserts,7 32 the Tuojie have crossed Lintao.8 Such as these have come, touched by imperial grace, how can those feeble slaves grapple with them?9 1 The souls of those killed in the rebellion will not forgive the rebels. 2 Li Chu, Prince of Guangping and Suzong?s eldest son, later Daizong. 3 Guo Ziyi, the Minister of Works, was second in command. The ?Leopard Bowcase? was one of the military classics and refers to Guo Ziyi?s knowledge of strategy. 4 Under the command of Li Siye, earlier described as Su Wu returning from Xiongnu captivity with the Han standards. 5 This is Pugu Huaien. In the Jin, L� Qian had a sword that was said to be suitable for someone who was to become one of the Three Lords; L� Qian gave it to Wang Xiang. The implication is that Pugu Huaien will rise to high office. 6 The wisp in autumn air was a proverbially tiny thing; this suggests the precision of the archers. 7 The Uighurs. 8 Another Central Asian people that came to the aid of the Tang. 9 That is, how can the rebel army deal with the Uighurs and Tuojie contingents of Tang forces?

They are delighted at how the capital is stirred, they take pity on the cries of those boys and girls. Every household is selling hairpins and bracelets 40 waiting only to present the spring ale. 5.32?34 Retaking the Capital I The immortal Guard left the Cinnabar Pole Star,1 demon stars shone on the steps of jade He was compelled to leave the palace and run, 4 he could not just stay, clinging to his mansion.2 For a while the carriage turned aside to Fenyang,3 at Liao a letter to the Yan general was sent flying.4 The plans of the seven ancestral temples are as they were, 8 once again a new beginning for the ten thousand regions. II I accept frailty and white hair in my life, in lonely isolation now at the ends of the earth.5 1 The palace. 2 That is, Xuanzong had to flee and could not live in his palace in peace. 3 Yao once met four Daoists on the north bank of the Fen (Fenyang) and forgot that he was a ruler. This again refers to Xuanzong?s flight from Chang?an. 4 In the Warring States the Kingom of Yan held one of the cities in Qi. The persuader Lu Zhonglian shot an arrow into the city with a letter. When he read it, the Yan general killed himself. An Lushan?s army was from Yan, thus the rebels were encouraged to surrender. 5 This is hyperbolic; Du Fu is in Fuzhou with his family.

I humbly meet a day of our lord?s self-blame, 8 shedding tears I gaze toward the blue wisps of cloud.3 III Sweating horses retook the palace, in the spring city the rebels? trenches are scraped flat. In reward they will surely sing ?Russet Pear,?4 4 the return is in time to present cherries.5 Federate barbarians? brandished pikes are thick,6 the mansions of meritorious officials rise high. Good news is brought often from all quarters, 8 His Majesty has no choice but to personally reward them. After Chang?an and Luoyang were retaken, those who had willingly or unwillingly accepted posts in An Lushan?s government were brought back to Luoyang to face charges. The most serious collaborators were executed; some, like the poet Wang Wei ?? (d. 761), were pardoned. Most were sent into administrative exile. Among the last group was Du Fu?s old friend Zhen Qian. 1 Suzong?s edict blaming himself. 2 *Four Graybeards. 3 The court. 4 A poem from the Classic of Poetry expressing appreciation of the efforts of soldiers who had been on campaign. 5 In mid-summer the emperor ritually presents cherries to his officials. 6 Suzong?s Uighur allies.

I Failed to be Able to Part Face to Face, But My Feelings Are Revealed in the Poem Master Zheng, useless chu tree, his locks turned to white silk,1 after drinking he always claims that he is an old painter. Ten thousand leagues, it pains my heart, this day of stern banishment, 4 approaching death in our hundred-year span, at the time of the Restoration. In confused haste he has gone to set off on that long journey, unexpectedly it happened that I was too late for your parting feast. Even if with you, sir, this parting is forever, 8 below on the roads of the Nine Springs we will always have times to share friendship. Du Fu?s brief period in imperial service after the recapture of Chang?an was one of the happiest periods of his life. 5.36 The La Festival2 On the La Festival in ordinary years warm weather is still far away, this year on the La Festival the ice has entirely melted.

(718?772) composed a poem on the dawn court gathering in the newly restored court. The companion piece by Du Fu survives, along with the companion pieces by Wang Wei and Cen Shen. Jia Zhi, Dawn Court at Daming Palace, for My Colleagues in the Two Ministries Silver candles scent the heavens, stretching along on purple streets, colors of spring in the Forbidden City, lush in the morning. A thousand fronds of pliant willows hang by blue chain-patterned gates, 4 with a hundred warbling orioles circling Jianzhang Palace. The sounds of waist-strung swords follow steps on the pavements of�jade, bodies in caps and gowns tease wisps of incense from imperial braziers. Together we bathe in waves of Grace by Phoenix Pool, 8 at every dawn court dipping our brushes to serve our Lord and Ruler. 5.37 A Companion Piece For Drafter Jia Zhi?s ?Dawn Court at Daming Palace?1 Night?s fifth watch, the water-clock?s sound speeds its morning marker, colors of spring in the ninefold palace make immortal peaches drunk. Sun warm on pennons and streamers, dragons and serpents stir, 4 by palace halls the breeze is light, swallows and sparrows fly high. Dawn court done, the scented smoke you carry filling your sleeves, the poem finished, pearls and jade are right on your flourished brush. If you want to see generations in charge of lovely silken lines,2 8 to this day on the pool there is phoenix down.3 1 Original note: ?The Drafter?s father was in charge of edicts? ???????. 2 The ?lovely silken lines? is the rhetorical elegance in drafting edicts 3 ?Phoenix Pool? was associated with the Secretariat, thus with the grand councilor. Jia Zhi was a Drafter in the Secretariat (zhongshu sheren ????), and Jia Zhi had referred to Phoenix Pool in his poem. Jia Zhi?s father, Jia Ceng, had also held the same post, thus ?to this day? suggests the son is continuing his father?s achievements.
