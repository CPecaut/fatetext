# FATEtext/data/library/README

With the noteable exception thebible.txt, which I'm distributing in pre-generated format, so that people can use FATEtext on the full text of The King James Bible without needing to figure out how to run the generator scripts, the files in this folder should be generated only (and not redistributed) from the properly sourced files in the fatetexts directory.

Separately, the URLs for articles, which I wrote and published online prior to 2021, that appear in the file suzythe.txt, have been included for the purpose of testing and demonstrating the feature of FATEtext that scrapes fair use snippets of content from the Internet and then displays those snippets to users of FATEtext along with links to the URL that had served as the context in which said snippets were derived via one oracular methodology and process or another.
